How to use HAN, RNN, BIRNN, ATTBIRNN, FastTEXT, BERT

1. There is three files in each modeel (contain directory)
   * main for own dataset
   * main1 for amazon dataset
   * model file(name of model eg HAN)
2. Simple run main and main1 (for both dataset) to run the code and import the model file from another file.

Make sure all required libraries are installed:
-tensorlow
-keras
-pytorch
-scikit-learn
-numpy
-fastText
-pandas
-Bert(pretrained)

i tweaked it a little removed onions because of onion haters in my house used italian seasoning instead of just oregano and use a paprika cayenne mix and a little more than the recipe called for we like everything a bit more hot the chili was amazing it was easy to make and everyone absolutely loved it it will now be a staple meal in our house
bush used to have a white chili bean and it made this recipe super simple written to them and asked them to please bring them back
i have a very complicated white chicken chili recipe that i have made for years everyone raves over it i saw this recipe and thought try it as an easy alternative for weeknights my husband likes this recipe better super easy and delicious i did cut back slightly on the crushed oregano and cayenne pepper otherwise i made it exactly as written
in your introduction you mentioned cream cheese but there is none listed in the ingredients
wonderful i made this for a 34chilistew34 night dinner at our church and everyone wanted the recipe we make it quite often at home and it39s always a hit i also use a freshly made rotisserie chicken which adds to the flavor
amazing my boyfriend loved it so much going to make it again this week
wow this recipe is excellent as written the only change i made was that i used a 40 oz jar of great northern beans it tastes so good with just the right amount of heat
this is delicious and i make it often one such time was when our daughter her husband and their two sons were visiting us from virginia i made a double batch and served it for dinner one evening and it really made a hit since there was a small amount left i put the leftover in the refrigerator i walked into the kitchen the next morning to see our son in law with a big bowl of it headed for the microwave which puzzled me he gave me a big smile and told me it was the first thing he thought of when he woke up that morning and that was his breakfast i give this soup 5 stars
i absolutely love this recipe i39ve tweaked it quite a bit when i want a spicier chili i exchange the green chilis for canned diced jalapenos it39s so good that way i also add an extra 4oz can of green chilisdiced jalapenos to it every time i make it it does not double well but have made 15 times the recipe and it39s great for extra large crowdsplenty of leftovers it39s a great snow day recipe i39ve made it 3 times these past 2 weeks
i make this a lot my kids and there friends come over and ask me to make this all the time
best and easiest white chili recipe
best white chili recipe i39ve had i served it up with fritos sharp cheddar sour cream and chopped green onions delish
this recipe was excellent i added the cream cheese and it was the perfect comfort food i usually make individual portions and freeze it but this was eaten everyday for 3 days exceptional
i made this alongside a traditional chili for a winter gathering and this chili stole the show i was expecting leftovers for additional meals during the week but nope no leftovers mild but always ways to spice it up if your preference if thinking about it just do it easy fast warming and delicious oh and might as well double it i did
fantastic but mild i added half a carolina reaper delish the hubby said he detested white chili as this was simmering hubby said 34boy that sure smells great when do we eat34 he asked me to make more to freeze for later lol
this is a fabulous recipe
delicious if you like a mild chilli taste this is for really would recommend making it
made according to directions delish
my new favorite soup oh my so delicious
this is a hit in my house i have been making it for a few years now i typically double the recipe as written adding only a can or two of sweet corn we always eat this with jiffy cornbread absolutely a favorite
delicious a huge hit with family and friends several requests to make again and share recipe thank you
this is our goto chicken chili recipe and has been for years we love it and it39s so simple
very good easy recipe first time followed exactly but i added flour to chicken and onion mixture to help thicken and did not add cream cheese made a second time with no mild chilies and only a few shakes of cayenne and it was still good liked it less spicy but will make again other in family liked it too
this is just white chicken chili with i first experinced eating at at local restaurant in indianapolis which was recommended to me by the waiter it39s delicious but that is what it is called white chicken chili
wow total wow totally delicious 5 stars plus
wonderful recipe as written only change i made was i used rotisserie chicken because i always have it on hand in my freezer as a time saver even my husband who said chili can39t be white said to make sure to keep this recipe thanks laura for making him a believer
i make this for my soninlaw for when he has to work cold winter nights in michigan he loves it instead of green chiles i changed to hatch green chiles to give it a little kick you can use as much or as little depending on how you like it
excellent recipe this will be on regular rotation
i don39t change a thing in this recipe it39sperfect as directed i found it in my taste of home cookbook years ago and have been making it ever since i don39t even look for other recipes because why mess with perfection i was just diagnosed with gluten intolerance and thankfully this recipe is my exhusband would not eat chicken so my son made it with pork also delicious he still used chicken stock but the ex didn39t know that
i would make this soup again it was a hit i would only add 1 can of green chilis when i make it again the leftovers were pretty hot
this was absolutely delicious it was my first time making chili and i loved it it turned out a lot more soupy than i expected and i even mashed up a cup of the beans like the recipe said i think next time i make this i won39t add the cream to see 9f that makes thicker but is super yummy even if it is more of a soupstew yummm
outstanding just the way it is
made this chili for several years and follow the recipe as written i use chicken tenderloins and heavy cream and sour cream not broken fix the perfect comfort food on a cold day the tortilla chips go perfectly and a grilled cheese on the side hurt either especially if made with home made pimento cheese
this is the best chili recipe i have gotten 3 blue ribbons making it for company cook offs last year mad it for a halloween party and it got rave reviews this year the party was banned 9but we had it anyway and the local police officer came to the party in the uniform and said 34i won39t say anything if i get some of that chili you made last year34 lol
this was excellent i only had 1 can of so i opened a can of jalapenos and added a teaspoon i threw it all in the ninja foodie and put it under pressure for 20 mins with quick release then i added the sour cream and whipping cream i served with crisp tortillas and shredded cheese it was loved by all even my granddaughter i will be making this again oh i have great northern beans so i used two cans of white beans turned out perfect
this is one of the few recipes i use where i change the ingredients love it
i didn39t see cream cheese in the recipe but it was in the description so i added it toward the end i added a little adobo seasoning and used my own dried cayenne also added diced tomatoes with green chili39s otherwise made the recipe as written it was fabulous a forever keeper thank you
been making this for my family for a couple decades now and it39s always gotten rave reviews i do add real garlic along with the chicken garlic powder and onion to sauté before adding the rest of the ingredients in the past i39ve substituted evaporated skim milk for the heavy cream and it turns out well that way too i cut back on the cayenne for my own reasons but my daughter loved it full strength probably going to be making this recipe for another couple decades as well
delicious i added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis and it turned out great
the best while iit is 34hot39 it is not a long lasting hoe
this was my first attempt at a white chili and was a little disappointed i added 8 oz of cream cheese instead of the sour cream and didn39t like the resulting flavor should have followed the recipe i will tinker with this some more but all in all a very easy quick recipe
we love this recipe and fix it often i even make it to take to people when they need a meal a couple of things i use unsalted chicken stock the 32 oz box instead of the broth and instead of the sour cream and heavy cream i use a 12 oz container of gandy39s french onion or green chili dip it just adds a little depth in flavor that we enjoy
this is my alltime favorite white chili recipe i make it as is except i will add a can of hominy and occasionally substitute pork for the chicken great with a spoonful of pico as well so good
i doubled the recipe i also substituted the sour cream with cream cheese added corn and bell peppers topped with sour cream cilantro shredded cheddar and fritos i am sooo very satisfied
where39s the cream cheese in the recipe it says it39s so good from the cream cheese was that a misprint
i made this last night for dinner it went together very fast and based on another reviewer i added 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of the sour cream i accidently added too much cayenne so i did offer sour cream at the table along with shredded cheese personally i am not much of a fan of beans of any kind but this chili was good the only problem was it did not make enough for the hearty appetites for all the people at the table next time i make this i will double the recipe but this is a keeper even by my standards
delicious first time ever making a white chili and this one delivered in every way fantastic as is didnt change a thing will be a favorite keeper for me thanks for sharing
i changed this a little i added carrots potatoes and substituted coconut cream for the cream i also left out the cumin the creamy mix of the sour cream and cream made this soup delicious
i made this for movie night with a few friends it got rave reviews and i thought it was yummy on advice of previous reviews i used cream cheese instead of sour cream i also popped a whole jalapeno in for the cooking process and fished it out and discarded when cooking was complete made it a day ahead of time the one person in the group who doesn39t like heat said it was just right this is definitely going into my file of favorites
i add creme cheese and more creme i also roast my chicken breasts in the oven and then pull and dice the meat i have won 3 chili cookoffs with my version
we have been making this for years now and its hands down our favorite chili recipe one thing i love about it is that you can substitute low fat versions of the creamsour cream and its still just as good i39ve even used skim milk in place of the whipping cream with no problems we always serve it with the zucchini amp cheese drop biscuits to die for
this recipe is awesome made it iver 10 times now a big hit with the family
is there cream cheese or no
very delicious and easy to make
im making this for dinner tonight but i39m a little confused you said it was sooo good because of the cream cheese but there is no cream cheese in the recipe do i need it
this recipe is amazing been making it for years ignore the rude and ignorant comments from those who have yet to actually make it if you want spicy feel free to add as much or as little of the cayenne pepper or jalapeños with or without seeds to your liking the beauty of cooking at home one tip i will give if you want an extra creamy texture add the creams in right away and let simmer until reduced
easy and tasty
this is the best white chili ever had it is a hit with this family old and young i always think i might have some for a few days but it never lasts that long he never gets tired of it and neither do i
my absolute favorite chili recipe so easy and delicious i added half a can of corn and a little hot sauce to the recipe and amazing
made this just as the recipie called for and it was delicious hubby loves it as well will be making it again soon
family favorite for many years share this recipe with family
so easy and flavorful will be a new regular recipe in my house
i have made this for several years it is definitely a favorite in this house i39ll need to double it in the future
we39ve made this several times through the years and it never disappoints also recipe doubles well
for those asking about the cream cheese they changed the recipe online it used to have cream cheese in place of the sour cream made this recipe for years i always look it up before i buy the ingredients to make sure i miss anything i search by chicken chili cream cheese to make sure i pull up this recipe i was surprised to see sour cream now especially because they specifically mention cream cheese in the description i will continue to make it with the cream cheese because this is a family favorite and i want to change not broken i make this close to the post recipe but i do slow cook it on the stove with boneless skinless chicken breast and i also add cilantro when i mix in the cream and cream cheese my picky boys love it
this is the best white chicken chili i have ever tasted everyone loved it and i am asked to make it all the time i am confused however by the little note at the beginning of the recipe which reads 34maybe it39s the cream cheese34 am i missing something i don39t see cream cheese in the ingredients list anywhere sounds like it would be good though i highly recommend this chili
i make this every year for thanksgiving i substitute turkey and turkey broth instead of chicken everyone loves it if i miss a year making it the family is complaining and wanting it
very tasty and quite simple to make
for those who are asking about cream cheese it39s not stated as cream cheese the heavy whipping cream is what they are referring to when saying to add cream
this is a very easy recipe that delivers excellent results could not get over how good it was will make again
where is the cream cheese that39s mentioned it39s not listed in the ingredients or directions
i39m confused in the description it says 34maybe it39s the cream cheese34 i can39t find and cream cheese listed in the ingredients
this is a very good recipe if needed it39s easy to change it i had to make some changes i cannot have beans so i didn39t put them in i didn39t have green chili so i added a can of tomatoes with green chillies it came out great i love recipes that can be changed to fit the person will be making this again
oh my gosh so good i substituted canelli beans because i like them better i added just one can of green and no heavy whipping cream or no substitute for it like others suggested for thicker chililike texture i added one tablespoon of flour to chicken
delicious and easy to make i followed the recipe with only tiny tweeks i didnt have any cumin so i used a little chili powder instead i also used just a little garlic only because we are both sensitive to it but if you are not then go for it im sure it would add a lot i didn39t have sharp cheddar so i used 4 cheese mecican blend shredded worked fine but these were minor tweeks and i39m sure it is fabulous just as written too mine was plenty thick so i dont know why some people felt theirs was too thin i did set out the 2 creams when i first started the dish so they wouldn39t be so cold when ready to add them i stirred a couple teaspoon of the hot chili into each to warm them up before adding so they wouldnt curdle i will defimitely make this again thanks for sharing this delicious recipe
i gave this 4 stars because i followed this recipe to a t but omitting the sour cream and heavy whip i mashed 1 can of beans to thicken the soul and added fresh garlic along with the powdered garlic i also added more seasoning to my taste of each i did add about 1 cup of the shredded cheese to the soup as well i also added some frozen corn and cilantro to the soup as well as adding cilantro as a topping this soup was amazing
this was hands down the most delicious white chili i have ever had i did not add tortilla chips and only used 1 can of the green and it was perfect
i didn39t change a single thing love it
i lovelovelove white chicken chili and play around with recipes for it often this was good i did changeadd quite a bit but my favorite too to share is this i saw a lot of people thickening with flour and gagged a little lol as a southern cook my grandma taught me long ago to slowly sprinkle in instant mashed potatoe flakes to soups etc you don39t taste the potato it thickens instantly and no lumps anyway here39s my other many many tweaks i used a cold storebought chicken and sauteed a large chopped vidalia onion half of a chopped red bell pepper and added fresh minced garlic to the veggies once they were softened i didn39t have green chiles so i added two drained cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles one mild and one 34mexican34 flavored yum also i had 2 cans of canellini beans white kidney beans instead of great northern as far as spice i doubled or tripled the cumin we like that flavor a lot and added a few handfuls of chopped cilantro also i seasoned the sauteing veg mix with the yellow adobo and the sazon completa seasonings served this with chips monterey jack cheese guacamole and lots more fresh cilantro so good butsorry this was so long
very good i wonder if it once had cream cheese and taste of home changed the recipe i prefer it with navy beans that are smaller i also used canned chicken from costco because what i had i used fat free cream cheese along with the whipping cream and then i stirred the cheddar cheese in at the end
the description says 34maybe it39s the cream cheese 34 where is the cream cheese in the recipe ingredients it says sour cream and whipping cream not cream cheese
this was just excellent i used half a pound of dry beans that i had cooked in my instant pot as well as shredded chicken from bonein thighs also cooked in the pressure cooker didn39t want to use heavy cream so i just used a little milk and thickened with a couple of tablespoons of masa harina i also shaved off a few calories with fatfree sour cream still very creamy and delicious probably could have added another can of green chiles and may just do that next time i make a batch of this
so good i doubled the recipe mine came out very thick because i blended 12 the beans with the chicken broth then added the rest of the beans i may need to add a splash of water in each serving i could go a little hotter next time i got a large jalapeño so only put in one minced mine maybe 2 next time used rotisserie chicken as a shortcut really delicious tho
very good recipe you do need to add a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch to it in order to thicken it up i did omit the green chiles in order to control the heat they can be added when served if you like it to be more spicy good for me without the chiles i also love to eat regular chili served over rice i did the same with this and it was great
i found this recipe about a month ago and my boyfriend is obsessed he made me bring it to thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit he39s having me make it again tonight for his birthday lol it really is the best chili ever
made this for the first time last night read all the reviews first however followed the exact recipe results thinner than desired but quickly fixed that with the great suggestion of 1 to 2 tbls flour served with tortilla chips great flavor big hit with the husband will make again with rotisserie chicken and replace the whipping cream and sour cream with cream cheese unless a thinner chili is preferred use the flour as other reviews suggest
this is an absolutely delicious recipe i actually tripled the recipe and added about 1 cup grated parmesan cheese it was not as thick as i would have liked it to be and was more like a soup than a chili but nonetheless it was extremely flavorful and tasty i will definitely make this again
this is a really good recipe i made it for the first time last night need a white chili recipe to take to a gathering i got a lot of compliments on it and several requests for the recipe i added minced garlic to it and additional chicken broth next time i39ll probably triple the recipe as written the yield is pretty small
i love this recipe i use 152 pounds of shredded chicken instead of cubed perfect for dipping tortilla chips in as well
it was a little too creamy for me
best recipe ever we all loved it and i have some picky eaters thank you for sharing so yummy and easy to make i delete anything but added red pepper even without that change it would be amazing thank you for sharing a new family fav yesss
excellent i took the advice of a previous review and added 1 tbsp of flour to the chicken onion garlic mix i used two jalapenos instead of the canned chilies i had to puree the beans only because my dh doesn39t like the bean texture and i used butter beans lastly i used 4 oz of cream cheese i had left in the fridge and a splash of heavy cream excellent
greta recipe used a rotisserie chicken when i made it
excellent recipe easy and quick a keeper next time i may add some frozen corn joyce moynihan volunteer field editor
so i read the reviews before making this i have never made white chili before but we tend to like our soups more like stew and our chili super thick so after the chicken onions and garlic i used fresh garlic were cooked i added two tbsp of flour and all the seasonings to the pot stirred it in to coat the meat and let it cook for a couple minutes then i added the broth chiles and three cans of beans finally i replaced the sour cream and whipping cream with cream cheese so yummy
loved it had a perfect little spice
i made this chili for our super bowl party everyone raved about how good it was and requested the recipe the only thing i did differently was simmered it all day so the flavors could meld and the chicken would be super tender it39s not a real thick chili but that could easily be remedied by adding a little cornstarch if that bothers you otherwise this is a delicious recipe and i39m so glad i gave it a try it39s a keeper
yum if you like really thick chili i would suggest cutting back on the stock and sour creamwhipping cream a bit and maybe the cayenne pepper too then or adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken or pureeing a portion as other reviewers mentioned but we thought it was really good as written just the right spiciness i can39t tolerate much heat but this leaves just a little 39bite39 in your mouth after eating it orif it39s too thin maybe you39re not simmering it long enough with the lid off
this was terrible i followed the recipe exactly it tasted fine until i added the sour cream and whipping cream then it turned into a thin white flavorless soup do not bother
my family loves the chili i thought the beans might scare my little ones so i blended it in my immersion blender a bit the second time i made it i did not blend and everyone enjoyed it and requested seconds great recipe thanks for sharing
besides being delicious it39s greatest strengths are it soooooo easy and quick the only thing i did differently is used 1 can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of no beans didn39t have 2 cans of northerns i too simmered it a bit longer to make it more chililike
love this chili since i like things too spicy i used less cayenne pepper and it was perfect
i have made this chil several times i cook for bingo and everyone really likes it at first they were afraid to try it as they had never heard of it my family also thinks it39s great
i pretty much stuck to the recipe except i used leftover chicken i did use one can of chilies and skip the cayenne pepperso i guess i really didn39t stick to the recipe it was good either way
very tasty and creamy
runner up in a chili cookoff however i did use a whole rotisserie chicken was very thick the way i wanted it based on the reviews below i did not want it to be thin crowd loved and i am almost certain i would have won if i hadn39t run out people came back for seconds before the last 5 people could judge it
my husband made this the other night for a crowd and it was delicious he did not add the jalapeno because we didn39t know if all the people could handle or enjoy that agree with the reviewers about it being thin but you can add crackers at the table or just tweak with cornstarch sour cream or cream cheese
really good recipe however after adding the sour cream and heavy cream it did get soupy after adding the creams i ended up putting it back on low heat to warm it back up and then added a teaspoon or so of corn starch to thicken it up worked perfectly
so so recipe it39s more like a soup than a hearty chili the recipe calls for way too much chicken stock half that amount would have been more than enough the chili never thickens no matter how long you cook it again this should be called soup not chili way better chili recipes out there won39t make again
this is a wonderfully tasty chili i got tired of tomato sauce so this was a nice change the first time i made this i tripled it for a family gathering and everyone loved it i only put in half the chili amount though it did get a bit soupy but i just let it simmer longer
steve cannellini beans are not the same as great northern beans great northern are smaller and have a different texture
this is great on a chilly overcast day my brother asked for this recipe
christine cannellini beans are great northern beans duh
this was very easy and very good i39m not sure that it yields 7 servings if served as a main course likely closer to 4 certainly precooked chicken or turkey could be used for even further ease making it a great recipe for leftovers i used cannellini beans and part of me thought they weren39t hearty enough i almost wanted to replace the beans with potatobut then i guess it wouldn39t be chili either way i will certainly make it again
i was looking for a chili with a white sauce because the tomato sauce gives me heartburn so does the white but not as bad when i found this and made it for the first time now my family can39t get enough of it it39s not difficult to make at all and heartburn yeah probably but who cares this stuff is the bomb thanks for the recipe it39s a hit and a change from the regular hamburger and red sauce it39s my new chili go to
delicious i loved it because it skips the tomatoes which i39m tired of lately every quick dish is buried in tomato saucehad to improvise only had 1 can of chilies added a tsp of chipotle to make up for it1 half breast wasn39t a pound 2 was a little over the extra bit of meat was a bonusdon39t always have heavy cream on hand had to leave it out but used a bit of whole milkserved it with crispy garlic texas toastthis is worth expanding for a crowd it39s a nice change from red chili that seems to be the rage
an extraordinary recipe we all loved this chili one of the better white chili recipes i39ve tried
make this you39ll be happy you did
i created an account simply to post this review that39s how good this chili is i made it as described and it was seriously amazing i personally wouldn39t change a thing i plan on making it again this weekend for out of town family that39ll be staying with us don39t hesitate to make this
this was just ok it wasn39t bad but i thought it was missing something corn cilantro not sure what i gave it 4 stars because of the ease of the recipe not sure how this recipe wins cookoff39s though
i used canned chicken even faster and easier a new family favorite
delicious this is definitely one of our favorites
i won yet another chili cookoff with this recipe last weekend it39s a keeper for sure
my husband is a chili lover he was however disappointed when i said we were having 34white chicken chili34 i left out the whipping cream and the recipe was fine as is when he ate it he was amazed and absolutely loved it this recipe is a keeper
this is a great recipe as written family loved it i want to make this without the beans as my husband is on a special diet that allows basically no fiber i am thinking of using pork in place of chicken and white potatoes in place of beans wondering if anyone has changed it around like this as long as the flavor is there i would think this would work any suggestions are appreciated
had to try this when i saw how many reviews it had i left out the whipping cream it turned out really great
wow this is a winner very tasty with just the right amount of heat after cooking the chicken and onions on the stove i put everything in my crock pot for 4 hours on low i was using fatfree sour cream so i mixed that with 2 tbsp of cornstarch to keep it from separating and i didn39t have any heavy cream so i left that out but it was plenty creamy without it i wouldn39t change anything else we really loved this recipe
i love it everyone in my home loves it and i have been asked for the recipe many times i have to triple the recipe for my family it is very easy to make
i39ve made this recipe several times for my family we leave out the chicken for vegetarian style and serve it over baked potatoes rice or quinoa they love it every time
this a an awesome recipe i shredded my chicken and it was even better the second daywhole family and staff loved it would not change a thing
good one
good recipe but on day 2 you need to serve the rest or freeze it chicken only tastes good for max of 2 days
easy to prepare great alternative to standard chili receipt i add sour cream later on once it is served otherwise fantastic receipt
this is a wonderfully rich and creamy chili that is quite different from other white chili recipes i39ve tasted it has been a hit every time i39ve made it i made two changes to the original recipe based on the reviews i read here i add a third can of northern beans and mash them to add thickness to the chili also instead of cooking a pound of boneless chicken breasts i use the breast meat from a storebought rotisserie chicken costco in my case the breast meat is already seasoned so no need for the garlic powder and canola oil i dice up the meat into 1434 cubes a little smaller than the original recipe one of the easiest chilis i39ve ever made and so delicious
i loved this recipe i added some red pepper flakes and probably would add a little more next time it does come out a little soupy so i may try smashing some of the beans next time or using a little less broth the sour cream and heavy cream added to the wonderful flavor i served over brown rice which was a fantastic pair
i have made this twice now for soup suppers at church and everyone loves it the only thing that i found was that the sour cream doesn39t want to mix in without being 34clumpy34 so next time i39ll whisk the sour cream and whipping cream together first to help loosen up the sour cream hopefully it will mix in more smoothly great recipe
so yummy i like to use fresh garlic in place of garlic powder 4 cloves i also use 34 cups chicken broth one can chilies and one can rotel to this recipe
this was really good easy to make and great on a chilly night loved the flavor thanks for sharing i will definitely make again
entered this chili in a chili cookoff contest and won everyone loved it made the recipe exactly as written i did smash one can of the beans to help thicken it up a bit
i too loved this chili made a few minor changes per reviewers additional can of beans a little less sour cream and heavy cream since it does turn out a bit soupy i serve it over rice or a baked or mashed potato everyone who tries it loves it
this is absolutely the best chicken chili i have made it for several different friends and everyone just loves it i make it exactly as the recipe statesdelicious
i have been making this chili for several years now i make it exactly as written i sometimes have a little more chicken than one pound as it39s hard to get a package of chicken breast that is 1 lb i just usually use 3 breasts so sometimes it39s a little more when making for company i have added one more can of beans it is delicious my advice to someone making it for the first time is make it exactly as written and then make any adjustments you want for next time
this is a favorite in our home especially on cold days during winter we have it regularly it has wonderful flavor i use all ingredients except i add a little bit of white chicken chili seasoning to it and put it in crock pot to cook at last add sour cream and whipping cream enjoy
i39m always amazed how people rate a recipe 5 and then state how they changed the recipe significantly so after reading all the comments i39ve read i39m not sure whether to even try the recipe why people can39t just do a recipe without changing it is beyond me how do they know what the 34real34 recipe is like to even begin to rate it
i have made this recipe several times and i love it the first time i used chicken breast second time i used ground chicken the ground chicken definitely made it feel more like chili but i like them both the changes i made along the way omit one can of green chilies add one can of beans which i then use to mash against the pot with a spoon to get a thicker consistency more like chili added some dried cilantro and a little more seasoning to taste to compensate for the extra beans yummy add some cornbread and you39re done quick and easy
the flavor of this chili is excellent i would mention that it could have been a bit thicker not so runny and i used chicken thigh meat instead which made the bites of meat super tender
i have made this chili recipe several times and it never fails to impress my only change is omitting the cayenne pepper great recipe

i used one less can of green chilies glory seasoned northern beans and omitted the salt very good the glory brand beans added much needed flavor frittos on top to add a little crunch and salt yummy
we love this chili recipe i always have to double it so we can have leftovers
if you puree i use my hand blender one can of the beans it becomes the thickener with no need for flour
great recipe 2nd time making it however it comes out like a soup i added wondra flour to achieve a thicker chili consistency love it this one is in my recipe collection thank you i did make this recipe again on nov 11 2016 even when i added a extra can of beans and mashed them prior to adding i still needed to thicken with flour for more of a chili consistency however still an awesome recipe
this is a wonderful recipe and simple to make all the ingredients blend well together and it is a great alternative to regular chili it is also super tasty the next day and reheats well thanks
this had very little flavor amp too many green chilies
i made this in the crock pot changes i made two frozen chicken breasts in crock potsauteed onion and minced garlic doubled the broth and never added the heavy cream or sour creamcooked on low for 8 hours it turned out great
y family loved this
very good cooked my own beans and used jalapeo ground pepper instead of cayenne pepper delicious
can you make this without the beans
this white chilli was really good just seasoned very well i was low on great white bean so made with half black eyed peas and half great white from dried beans cook the beans first will be making this again yummy wow
best white chili recipe in town i39ve been making this for 20 or so years i do not take it anywhere where i don39t get asked for the recipe also if you do like it a little spicier you can buy 34hot34 chopped green chilies not jalapenos instead of the regular mild ones
very good will make again i added more beans just my personal preference
we really liked this recipe and the only change i made was adding 3rd can of beans after reading the other reviews next time i make this chili i will decrease the amount of sour cream and i will keep the pan on the stove after adding the sour cream amp heavy whipping cream otherwise it cools the dish to lukewarm this is a unique and flavorful meal
good stuff things i did differently i sauteed 1 fresh garlic clove and one finely chopped jalapeno upped more spices added a dash of cinnamon and shredded a preroasted chicken to save time i also added more cayenne pepper because it just wasn39t spicy enough for me i also mashed up one can of the beans to help thicken it a bit and i used garlic salt instead of reg salt i added bacon crumbles and sharp cheddar this made it super flavorful and clearly not healthy at all but so good
terrific used this for a dinner party and everyone walked away with the recipe didn39t change anything about the recipe
this recipe is amazing i will definitely be making again
this was delicious the only changes i made was reducing the amount of sour cream and adding an extra can of northern beans
i made this last night and it was amazing both my husband and i loved it i did not have sour cream on hand so i just added extra heavy cream and it was great this will now be in my fallwinter 34go to34meals it really was a quick meal prep too

wonderful
i haven39t tried this recipe but feel i can give it a five star rating because i have a very similar recipe which everyone enjoys the only difference is that i use 2 tbsp of fresh cilantro in place of the oregano and 1 12 cups of shredded monterey jack in place of the whipping cream and cut the sour cream to 12 cup i also cut back the pepper and cayenne pepper because my family doesn39t like foods too 34hot34
i made this chili for the first time last year at a chili cookoff at work we were doing a fundraiser for the north texas food bank i didn39t win but i had several people ask for the recipe they loved it it was devoured in minuteswell i made it again last night and entered it in the chili cookoff again today wellthere were 18 entries and i won 3rd place again had many tell me how they loved it and asked for the recipei love this chili but i do have one secret that i cannot share
i39ve made this chili several times everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it it39s a huge winner for me
34great flavor and texture though i must agree with some of the other reviews its closer to a chowder than a chili i added 1 cup of mozzerella cheese when i added the cream and let it simmer about 10min more it thickened it and rounded out all the flavors great dish i39ll be making it again34
fantastic taste it is more like a soup than a chili i didn39t read the directions carefully amp added the sour cream amp heavy cream at the same time as everything else still turned out perfect the only changes i made was i used leftover roasted chicken amp fresh green pepper instead of canned
made just as recipe read except i only had 1 milk all it needed was a pan of cornbread delicious
this chili was very flavorful and easy to makefreezes well
this is the best white chili i double the recipe so we can enjoy leftovers thank you for a real keeper
it really hit the spot
i love this and so did my family
this chili is off the charts good everyone in my family raved about it i did use fresh minced garlic and added more chicken and beans for a bigger crowd this is definitely going in my favorite recipes box
this is a great recipe i did only put half the sour cream in and added no cream turned out sooo yummy
this is a great recipe i did only put half the sour cream in and added no cream turned out sooo yummy
i used half amp half instead of whipping cream everyone enjoyed it and had seconds
this was so good super easy to make only thing i did different was i added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder
got good reviews but i wanted a little something more flavorwise i will tweak next time maybe it needs some bacon
this was very good but i will add an extra can of beans next time
really good and quick i think sweet corn would be good in it too firstof6ps
i made it exactly as indicated and it was fantastic i wanted to lick the bowl this recipe is a keeper
my whole family enjoyed this decadent chili that is more like a soup so easy to make
tasted great next time i may add sweet corn
wonderful recipe loved your response to 3939sunshinebakerpa3939 mdredmond made my daythanks
sunshinebakerpa said 34i made it without the green chilies but found it was missing something i used a little less sour cream and heavy cream like the others had suggested to make it thicker34so you made your own chili recipe omitted chilis and thought it was missing something then you rated this recipe 35 i hope you aren39t a registered voter
for me a published recipe is a guideline rather than an absolute i adjusted this recipe slightly based on the ingredients i had on hand i added 12 t poultry seasoning in place of oregano used minced garlic instead of garlic powder i only had one can of chopped green chilies so added a cup of chopped red yellow and orange bell pepper we like heat so i used 1t of cayenne and we added sliced jalapeo peppers and shredded cheese on top forgoing the sour cream i used 2 c of whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream and 2 t corn starch as a thickener there are so many ways to make white chili that as long as you keep it white and use the right amount of herbs and seasoning based on the preferences of those you are feeding you39ve got a hit every time our side was a handful of gluten free corn chips but sweet cornbread would be perfect too
absolutely delicious reading all the reviews i have to say ditto excellent fantastic wonderful wouldn39t change a thing i did chop my chicken that was parcooked instead of cubing it however and cooked in crock pot 45 minutes on high then about 3 hours on low my 11yearold is picky and didn39t seem thrilled about white chili he now says it39s the best thing in the world and he could eat it every night it went great with tortilla chips too
i use a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket i make it without the green chilies so to give it more flavor i add concentrated chicken broth i use a little less sour cream and heavy cream like the others had suggested to make it thicker it freezes well
we39ve made this twice in the last two weeks yummy
have made this several times it39s a big hit in our house
would make again used approx 12 cup sour cream and a little under 12 cup for the whipping cream to make it thicker simmering helps the liquid reduce made corn bread to go with it yum
so good my husband and i really liked it better than my other white chili recipe
this was delicious everyone in the family enjoyed it definitely a keeper
this chili was amazing my family loved it i definitely recommend trying it
this is now 34my34 chili recipe it39s a total knockout i use 1 can of northern beans 1 can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of sweet white corn my friends and family beg for it
i39ve been looking for a great chicken chili recipe this one doesn39t quite fit the bill for my family although it39s good it39s just missing that something special maybe cilantro would make the difference
made this and everyone loved it i didn39t have the green chilies so i used a few red pepper flakes will definitely make this again
very good i didn39t have any of the spices but had a pack of white chicken chili seasoning and used it i also left out the green chilies since i have young children because we have 6 people in our family i added 2 more cans of beans and more broth to stretch it further still very good gonna add this to my regular winter recipes
great flavor but not as thick as i would have like it but even my fussy eaters who were not looking forward to it liked it
good stuff i made it for dinner this weekend my girlfriend and i loved it i substituted about 12 oz of recently purchased 34dynamite34 roasted chilies for the 8 oz of canned green chilies we both like our chili with a tad of 34whang34 to it the two of us finished off the leftovers the next day for lunch i will definitely be making this again
made this hearty chili tonight for dinner and my family really loved it it has a nice combination of flavors and is really delicious i will be adding creamy white chili to my recipe book
excellent is all i can say with cornbread muffins yum yum
i love anything with green chilies in it and this was great i could have eaten the entire pot it was so good our weather became winter overnight 28 below the other night and this was hearty tasty and super easy to make the perfect cold weather recipe i had to make a few adjustments because i live in the country and didn39t want to navigate the icy roads just to get the few ingredients i was lacking i looked up substitutions for heavy cream and sour cream on the internet and i am certain it was close i used fresh garlic and added red pepper flakes because i love them and add them to whatever i can get away with i would add them to my coffee if it would work thank you laura for this great recipe i am debating whether to make another batch tomorrow i usually share what i cook with family that lives close by but i want to hoard this it is so good i don39t review many recipes but this one was worth searching for my login info to leave my comment
excellent flavor delicious and quick this one is a keeper
this was simple to make but had a flavor that will make your family think you have worked all day preparing it didn39t change a thing next time i will try the advice to serve with cornbread
every one enjoyed this meal the heat was perfect for me i added cheddar cheese to the top and had some tortilla chips with that others in my household also added jalapenos and hot sauce as they like things extra hot i guess everyone loved it and it was so fast and easy to make
wonderfully delicious on this cold winters day i39m an intermediate level cook i get excited about finding and trying new recipes and today i39m totally excited this is just an easy recipe with a lot of taste i followed the recipe exactly and won39t change a thing when i make this again and again and again thank you for the recipe happy eating everyone
very good the only thing i would do differently would be to add a 3rd can of beans
made this recipe exactly as stated except i doubled it glad i did because it was gone delicious and quick
i too have been making this chili since i first received my taste of home magazines as a yearly gift from my mom years ago very easy and very tasty now the weather is here for this recipe to be used alot we are steering away from red meat so this is a winner
i have been making this for years it is a huge hit i omitted the whipping cream and add canned milk thickened with a little corn strarch i also omit the cayenne pepper it was just to spicy with it
i39ve been making this for years it is the absolute best chili and easy to make it39s a hit whenever i serve it
i found this recipe a couple of years ago it is one of the most requested recipes by my family in the fall and winter
i39ve been making this same recipe for years and it is always a hit i add a can of white sweet corn to it and serve with cornbread
i39ve made this recipe for years since it was first published the first time i made it i followed the directions exactly and found it a little too spicy with the green chilies the next time and each subsequent time i39ve left out them out and to my family it39s the perfect white chili
these dish was terrific it was a little spicy for me but my husband said it was just right because of some of the reviews the only thing i changed was cutting the whipping cream in half and only used 6 ounces of sour cream definitely will be one recipe kept in my folder
liked the flavor and the touch of heat was good
the flavor here is a nice mild heat tempered by the sour cream and heavy cream if you do not like heat omit the cayenne pepper i made a savory cornbread to go with this sans sugar added cheese garlic powder and onion powder in place of buttermilk i used powdered milk and a corn mealflour premixed and added a cup of cheese nice for a rainy autumn day enjoy
i added a chopped jalapeno texans love their heat fresh garlic and served with corn bread and had grated cheese and cilantro as toppers to add a little texmex to it very good
too spicy for my taste i should have left out the cayenne pepper otherwise really good flavor
wow i thought it would be good but this is fabulous i served it with cheezit crackers instead of saltines and it was a hit this is a keeper
this recipe is also delicious when made in the crock pot
my husband39s favorite soup ever
amazing
this is a crowd winner every time
my husband and i loved this chili excellent recipe lots of flavor
we love this recipe any one i make this for loves it and asks for it i would give it 5 stars but for one thing as delicious as it is i think it is much improved with the addition of some cilantro
i absolutely love this recipe and have made it many times since it made its first appearance in taste of home magazine back in 2001 the only negative is that it is a bit rich so it should probably be a onceinawhile thing
this is absolutely delicious i would give it a 50 star rating if i could we made it exactly the way the recipe states we figured if we liked it and we were going to make it again we would make a change then however it is perfect exactly the way it is we love it i made a batch yesterday already gone so i39m making another batch today anyone who said they didn39t like it which is maybe one or two must have used different brands or something than what we did because this is seriously goodi can39t wait to have more today
i39ve had white chili before but thought a creamystyle would be a nice twist this was so delicious my husband kept raving about it
really really good
delicious
i love this recipe i won 34most original34 in a chili cookoff with this
i have never tried a white chili before but this was delicious and easy to prepare this will be part of my regular dinner rotation
so easy to make and so delicious we loved this recipe and will be making it again
fabulous recipe the best white chili i have had
a huge favorite in our house just make sure you use good northern beans i know that i39ve gotten some canned northern beans that are mushy to begin with that doesn39t make for a good chili
this recipe is amazing i used ground chicken and ground italian sausage about half and half and followed the recipe exactly for everything else cooking the sausage and chicken together adds lots of flavor it39s turnout delicious twice now i highly recommend
this soup is good and easy to make i did make a few changesi used leftover chicken 3 cans beans a little extra water to simmer in and i left out the cream because i didn39t want it any thinner i would use milk to thin if needed it was yummy and easy
this recipe tastes so good i use garlic cloves instead of the powder and skip cayenne i already take cayenne caps each day loved it
my husband and i loved it and i would make it again for us but the kids did not care for it too many beans for their taste i followed another reviewers suggestion to cook it in the crockpot on low and stirred in the sour cream and cream about 30 minutes before serving
this was super easy and delicious will definitely be making again
awesome white chili my husband was skeptical since chili is one of his favorite foods he loved it it is now a favorite in our house
this is my favorite white chili recipe i39ve made it several times we found it to be a little hot for our taste so i now leave out the cayenne pepper sometimes i substitute a 13 oz can of chicken instead of the fresh chicken breast and cook it in a crockpot on low for 3 or 4 hours then stir in the sour cream and cream just before serving
this is a new favorite in my house it39s so quick and easy but tastes like it took all day i modified the recipe a bit i bake then shred the chicken i also leave out the onions i hate the texture but like the taste so i use onion powder i also hate the texture of green chiles so i puree them in the food processor

awesome enjoyed every bite will definitely make again next time i would make a little spicier
this recipe is a keeper it has a very nice flavor will make it again
wanted some chili on this very cold winter39s day and this really hit the spot i used half lb of chicken breast and half lb of chicken italian sausage because that is what i had on hand it is fabulous the aroma got my sleepyhead son out of bed looking for food great with cornbread on the side
love this chili i39m not a fan of 34red34 chili so this is perfect i39ve been asked to share this recipe many times over and it39s always a big hit
i tried this for dinner last night it was very good not too spicy i did not have whipping cream in the house so i served it without that in my opinion the sour cream really mellows and compliments the spices used hubs is not a spicy food lover but he cleaned his bowl and asked for more would definitely recommend this recipe thanks for sharing laura
love love love this recipe i double the broth for a soupier texture i have also served it without the sour cream and whipping cream some time i just called in a chicken green chili soup you can even add potatoes and call it a stew as a person that grew up in nm it is a taste of home love love love it
this was very good i forgot to put the sour cream and whipping cream in stiil good
family loves it easy and tasty
i39ve taken this to potlucks and always get rave reviews on it and requests for the recipe i love it
wow what great flavor and easy to make i cut back on the sour and heavy cream to reduce some of the calories and it was still great tasting
this was very good i will make it again
this was excellent and a hit with my family i will definitely make this again

wonderful
absolutely delicious everyone loved it and had perfect flavoring making it again very soon
absolutely delicious everyone loved it and will definitely be making it again
most of my family loved this i did make a few minor changes to adapt to my daughter39s taste while keeping the essence and taste of the recipe in tacti took a note from 34purplepentacle34 using fresh garlic along with toasting and grinding my own cumin seedsmy daughters do not like green chilies so i reduced it to one can they also love the taste but not the texture of onions because of this after sauteing the onion and garlic i pureed them along with the green chilieswe love cilantro and use it in most of my soups so i doubled the amount usedi added 14 cup of rice my daughter doesn39t like the consistency of chili so because of this and the addition of the rice i used 48 ounces of broth this gave it a chowder consistencyto make it healthier i used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and plain greek yogurt rather than sour creami was in a hurry so i used a store bought roasted chicken i added a splash of lemon juice to cut the 34greasiness34 of the chickeni served it in small bread bowls it was very stick to your ribs and is now a favorite
this was a big hit i made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe first of all my daughters do not care for green chilies so i used only one can i also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic my daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro i use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups so in this case i doubled the amount of cilantro additionally i added a quarter cup of rice my oldest doesn39t like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice i used a 48 ounce box of broth this gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved i used precooked roasted chicken so i added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the 34greasiness34 lastly to make it healthier i swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain greek yogurt for the sour cream all of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter
i39ve been looking for this recipe for 3 years and am so glad to have found it it is delicious my friends loved it as much as i did this one will be made again and again love it
perfectly delicious confirmed by my husband requesting leftovers for two more subsequent meals added 34 cup kernel corn sprinkled cheese on top garnished with chopped tomato and a few dollops of guacamole beautiful and delicious
i have made this several times and always love the creamy chili on a cold day i replaced the whipping cream with canned evaporated milk skim is what i like caloriewise l also add 1 can creamed corn and stir in monterey jack cheese with great results i top with light sour cream and chopped green onions serve with your favorite corn chips my family requests it all the time
one of the best chili i39ve ever had
not sure what all the 5 star reviews are about i was disappointed my husband liked this because it was spicy my kids and i did not i had to make a second dinner for them after they begged not to eat it it will give you lots of gas too
we like this recipe as it39s very tasty and different i added diced celery and bell pepper since i was out of the green chili39s and added an extra can of beans my husband really liked it
absolutely the best chili we39ve ever had i used rotisserie chicken which i added at the last minute and only used one 4oz can of green chiles oh my delicious
this is wonderful really quite easy to make and tastes delicious i love it
my hubby absolutely loves this he requests it more than beef chili my 6 yr old will eat this like its going out of style never any leftovers in our house
we love soups and this one is terrific just enough 34bite34 to be interesting
i have made this recipe a number of times it is so easy to make and so delicious i have made it for family and friends it is awesome
thick and rich really enjoyed as an alternative to a traditional chili
very good recipeeasy to make
this was wonderful i served it up with some cajun bread and everyone loved it
i have never made white chili before and i was sceptical to try this i am so glad i did my entire family loved this i cooked my chicken lightly in my skillet with oniongarlic but then instead of cooking it all on the stove i put it over into my crockpot with all of the other ingredients i started this in the morning on high and it was ready in 4 hours i chose this method because i am a busy mom and i like to start my meals in the morning and then have all the prep work done for me i served this up with some cajun bread and we had a wonderful lunch thank you for another wonderful recipe taste of home will be making this one again
extremely tasty easy to make will make again
i made this with low calorie fat free substitutes and it was great whole family enjoyed family of 4 ate all of it would make a side salad to go with it next time
my family loves this recipe i altered it and added corn starch to make it a bit thicker plus we use crushed tortilla chips on top as a garnish
will do this againexcept next time i will use more beans very tasty just a trifle thin for us mushrooms sound like a good idea too
so delicious the only thing i changed was i added a can of corn and i only used 1 can of green chilies
very good simple amp quick white chili recipe i added 12 tsp of cinnamon
my husband and i love this instead of cayenne and green chilis i use a can of rotel it comes out great
i made it for our staff lunch it was really good thanks for the recipe
this one was a hit with all the family i used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and didn39t add sour cream during cooking everyone added their own sour cream at the table
this is my first time to make a white chili this is wonderful it is so easy to make i used an already roasted chicken from the deli and also added a can of mushrooms everything else i kept the samei made some honey beer bread to go with it what and awesome dinner the wine was good too
this was definitely a hit i didn39t use the heavy cream at all i only used the sour cream and i added a can of mushrooms also i have to wonder if it is coming out different for people that live in different places i live in southern new mexico we are in the desert and elevated like 3500 ft it wasn39t thin for me nice and creamy and delish
we were disappointed after all of the great reviews for this recipe the only changes made were to add 1 tsp minced garlic and use 33 less sodium chicken broth this was just okay for us perhaps we prefer beef chili instead
there39s another white chicken chili from taste of home that i usually make that is done in the crockpot and starts with a jar of alfredo sauce i decided to make this one because i wanted something that i could make quickly that didn39t have to cook all day this tasted similar and we really liked it because it was quick i think i will double next time for more leftovers
a great change really good
very very good and easy to make
very good followed the recipe except didn39t add the cayenne which would have helped will next time
first time i39ve made a white chili we loved it i used only one can of chilies and it was plenty of heat for us next time i may add another can of beans but it is thick enough with the just the two
this is great anyway but after making it at least 20 times now i have some suggestions add an extra can of great n beans and thicken the soup with some cornstarch or flour use tillamook brand sour cream there is a huge difference iv39e tried both
this recipe is amazing i wanted a unique chili to enter in my first contest and i wont third place the top three chilis were very close in points and everyone was raving about this chili i didnt hear one person complain about it i doubled it because of entering it into a cookoff and i also added two jalepeno39s to give it a little bit of spice a for this recipe
made just as it said to was great husband even asked about it and said it was very good
made just as it said to was great husband even asked about it
this soup was a hit it was easy and quick to bring together the only thing i did different was add a fresh jalepeneo to the canned chillies i think it could benefit from some more veggies like corn the other thing i noted was that to me it seemed salty i think next time i make it i will cut back on the salt added and add some corn
this chili was a hit with adults and kids garnished with some grated mexican cheese and it made it cheesy licious the only thing i thought it lacked was some veggiesi thought maybe some frozen corn could be addednext time i will try that
was not to impressed with this recipeall i could taste was the cream
very simple to make with great taste very nice change i made this in the crockpot all day on low amazing plan to make this for dinner with friends after christmas serice cant wait
this recipe is very simple and tastes great i add a can of rotel and use one can of chilies delicious
my fiance and i made this for the first time tonight and it was amazing it was a delicious balance of cream and spice we would recommend this to anyone
i made a double batch of this but put in only half the chilies since we don39t like spicy i also used a bulb of fresh garlic absolutely delicious
this recipe is really good my picky brothers devoured it
this chili is great the only changes i made i doubled the recipe used 12 heavy cream and 12 half amp half and added 2 extra cans of green chilis my family really liked it but my son who doesn39t like sour cream thought the sour cream flavor was too strong so next time i will cut the sour cream in half this recipe is definitely a keeper
very nice flavor the only problem i had was with the consistancy it was more like soup than chili
this was so good and easy the only changes i made were to use a whole roasted chicken cut up and instead of whipping cream i used fat free half and half it turned out great
reading all the 5 star reviews i thought this would be a slam dunk it was good but disappointing not what i expected i have another similar recipe that39s the keeper so i will stick with that one
very tasty i made the mistake however in that i put too much broth in and it turned more into a soup then chili but it was still good and i will definitely try this again
i cut the recipe in half i didn39t have fresh chicken on hand so drained a can of chicken yummy next time i39ll make the whoe recipe no leftovers
served this to a friend just last night every time i make it people rave about it
this is the most wonderful white chili i have made it over and over it is my families favorite i make it with the spiciness or without
very good i mashed up an extra can of beans to thicken a keeper
very good and very easy
made a double batch for a work luncheon they ate the whole thing even though there were 9 soups and it made a large crock pot full i mixed the everything together including the cream and sour cream before cooking in the crock pot on high for 4 hours it turned out wonderful i also only added 3 cans green chiles 1 12 the recipe instead of double just so it wouldn39t be too hot next time i will add all 4 cans because although it had a kick it wasn39t as much as i like i also did as others have recommended and used instant potato flakes to make it creamier definitely a keeper thanks for submitting it
terrific and easy
doubled this recipe for a dinner at work raves
this recipe won my chili cookoff at work today d i added 1 pound of ground chicken spiced it up a little more and used potato flakes to thicken it up a little and it was perfect glad to see this is a contest winner on the site as it was in my office as well
wow my family loved this even my picky eaters my husband said it39s so good it could win a contest i even had to substitute a couple items and it still turned out incredible thank you for the 5 star recipes renae
great recipe so easy to make and so full of flavor this recipe is a keeper
this is one of my husband39s favorites and i make it on a regular basis during the colder months which is almost all of them here in oregon i usually reduce the jalapenos and pepper for my daughter and i who can39t handle a lot of spices we top it with onions and shredded cheese and serve with cornbread yum
my family loved this chili even my two picky boys ate it up my husband was vocally disappointed when the last of the leftovers was gone and he has never done that before over leftovers of anything i will be making this again often
absolutely horrible i39m a great cook and this turned out terrible i even added things to help it and it was terrible i39m entering a chili contest tomorrow and this will definitely notgo in
really easy and tasty loved it
got this recipe from my sister last year and i have made it many many times and even put some in the freezer it is sooooo good and everyone i have ever fixed it for wants the recipe i have even made it for a friend that has to count sodium intake i used no salt broth and seasoned myself best chicken chili recipe ever
hands down one of the best soups we39ve ever had the only thing we changed was adding one can of the green chilies instead of two my nine year old couldn39t get enough
i have been making this chili for years everyone who tastes it asks for the recipe fantastic
i have always enjoyed white chili since it doesn39t have the acid that is in regular chili my friends here in indiana would always say 34what39s that34 then i began sharing this recipe one told me all she could do was smile with every bite i agree i just love the creaminess and the 34just right34 spices i see why it is contest winning
i39ve made this recipe many times for family and friends always a huge hiteven with the pickiest of eaters i do omit the whipping cream as it gives the chili a sweeter tasteand a lot more fat and calories i also put shredded cheese cilantro and lime on top
very good my family loves
i made this for my husband and a friend and they both loved it i only used one can of green chilies and i omitted the onions i added 5 drops of potent hot sauce at the end as well it says it yields 7 servings but i would say this comfortably feeds only 5 people
so good i make this about once a week during the winter time
i39ve made this twice this week it39s great
the flavor in this was very good it is easy to double for a large kettle i found it slightly soupy for my taste but i added some mashed potato flakes and it was great the leftovers made a great base for green chili chicken enchiladas
this is my new 34go to recipe34 i have already emailed it tyvm for submitting it i added a little white winecilantro added 1 c chicken brothas i added 2 potato39s at the end as i roasted a spiced up chickenpotato39s the night before for supper then used that in this recipe chipolte pepper39s would be a nice change also
this is the best white chicken chili i have ever had
i omitted the green chilis and i loved it added some cheese and oyster crackers to my bowl and was delicious i am going to make this again and again finally a chicken chili recipe that i can use
my guys loved this recipe ask for it on a regular basis now
so good i omitted the green chilies because we don39t like a lot of heat and it was still zippy and tasty added 1 cup frozen corn didn39t have heavy cream so i used 4 oz cream cheese instead also used 3 cloves garlic in place of the garlic powder this is a wonderful cold weather meal
this was very easy and my family loved it i did use lowfat sour cream and my son added cheese to his bowl
i cut the calories and fat way down by using nonfat sour cream and substituting nonfat skim evaporated milk for the heavy cream and it is still yummy a family favorite
wonderful recipe i used 8oz light cream cheese instead of the cream cuts way down on the fat
this was so good the only thing i would do is leave out the salt and use lower sodium broth it was great just too salty
it was tasty but way too spicy i had to give it away because no one would eat it
quick and easy to make my family asks for it all the time i don39t add the green chiles instead i use 34ghost chiles34 a very small amount adds a lot of heat and a wonderful smoky flavor delicious
this is a family favorite i use canned chicken reduce the broth and add a can of corn perfect with hot cornbread
i39ve never made white chili before and wanted something different for our church chili cookoff made this recipe and won 1st place excellent and very easy to put together i made it in advance but did not add the sour cream and whipping cream about 20 minutes before serving time i added the two ingredients and heated through ymmmm
i tried this on my family and my daycare girls and they all loved it and want it again
this is one of the best white chili recipes i have found i made it for a dinner party where one of the people is a very good chef she thought this was so good and requested the recipe
this is a great recipe i wish i had a contet to enter it in the next i have a craving for chili i39ll make this mmm mmm good
this white chili is awesome i have shared the recipe many times family and friend favorite
very easy and very delicious this is a keeper folks next time may add some mushrooms and red bell pepper to bulk it up a littlebut don39t have to
oh my goshthis is not only one of the easiest recipes i have madebut also one of the yummiest love it also a great way to use left over turkey
this was superb i was really easy to make too i highly recommend it
flavorful and creamy loved the variation from regular chili
i added one more small can of chilies only 12 the salt switched out the whipping cream for ff half and half but to keep the thickness i added some dark ale and cornstarch mixture to it this is a keeper
garnish with cilantro additions puree an additional can of beans to thicken chili season chicken with poultry seasoning to enhance the flavor add sliced cremini mushrooms for a heartier bowl
wonderful flavour with just a little kick to it didn39t have any cumin so added a 12 teaspoon thyme
this is the best chicken chili i have ever had it is worth the time to make i suggest doubling the recipe though if more than 2 people are eating it as it doesn39t make very much the next time i make i39m going to try lowfat sour cream and whipping cream to try to cut down on the cals love it
amazing my whole family loves this
i made this for my family today and according to my husband and 8 yr old son this is the best chili ever i did however make a few changes i used smoked turkey breast that my husband made over the holidays instead of the chicken i also used 2 fresh garlic cloves minced and did not saute the meat onion and garlic i substituted italian seasoning for the oregano and white pepper for the pepper last of all i just dumped everything in the crock pot set on high for about 3 12 hours adding the sour cream and cream the last half hour delicious
fabbbbuuuullllooouuuussss the best nonred chili i have ever had
this recipe is delicious i39ve been making this for at least 2 years i serve this at bingo quite a few times during the winter i39ve gotten so many compliments on this it39s also a favorite at home
yum yum yum this was absolutely delicious my husband who doesn39t usually eat this sort of thing loooves it i double the recipe and put some in the freezer
excellent the only thing i39d do different next time is use less sour cream my picky eater who doesn39t like anything spicy ate this and asked for seconds not spicy don39t let the cayenne pepper fool you
i love love this recipe
great recipe it was delicious
wowwwwww so good love it
this soup is so good i added 2 diced jalapenos and extra beans and used 12 amp 12 will be making this for christmas eve dinner with the kids yum
loved this chili made a few alterations taking a cue from other reviews added a can of navy beans chopped crimini mushrooms a jalepeno and a bit extra cayenne pepper will make again great recipe
my whole family loved this i omitted the chilis and cayenne pepper i replaced the heavy cream with half and half
not as creamy as the picturemore like a soup but delicious
i39ve made this too many times to countbut instead of using the chicken breast i use smoked boneless chicken thighs hubby cooks them i modify the seasonings to suit our tastes today i used smoked cumin alot of ancho chili pepper and ample cayenne i use halfnhalf instead of heavy cream and light sour cream did i mention to add alot of garlic this chili is always amazing it39s a family fave
i have been making this recipe for a couple of years now it is extremely popular with family amp friends we like to serve with buffalo wing sauce for an extra kick
is our family39s favorite soup in the world my soninlaw hates beans but always requests i make this for him i always have to double and triple the recipe because it is gone in a heart beat great with salad and bread
one of my absolute favorite recipes
our favorite recipe instead of chicken i use browned ground turkey excellent
i got this recipe years ago in a taste of home magazine i have made it so many times my little recipe card is getting worn out it is incredibly yummy and so easy to make
this is my first time making chicken chilithis just looked good so i tried it and it was really goodi used a whole chicken and made my homemade brothkicked it up with habanero pepper and smoked salti will make this again and again
i make this recipe at least a half dozen times each year to make it faster i buy a rotisserie chicken from the deli and add dried onions instead of fresh dinner can be ready in minutes and my entire family loves it
i modified this recipe for the slow cooker i used about 2 cups of cooked shredded chicken and omitted the oil i then added all the other ingredients except the creams to the slow cooker i also added an extra 2 cans of beans i slow cooked on low for 67 hours and then added the creams about 30 min1 hour before serving it was delicious and i was very happy with the way i turned out in the crock i have added it to my 34will make again34 recipe collection
this was delicious and super easy to prepare i added fresh garlic and hot sauce and used light whipping cream i also seasoned the chicken with a blend of poultry spice this was so yummy i was proud to serve it and will absolutely make it again
awesome every time i make this someone asks me for the recipe you can always play with the heat level by adding jalapeno
excellent will make often
when cooking for others this dish is one of the most requested i like to use ground turkey instead of chicken breasts it39s cheaper and i like the texture a little bit better my husband isn39t a fan of chili but he loves this
we make this recipe several times a year a family favorite
delicious this is a new favorite the only things i added were 2 cans of black beans and half a bottle of beer great recipie thank you
one of our family favorites super easy to make and tastes wonderful i sub ground chicken for the breasts and it makes it even easier amp more chili like
what a delicious alternative to regular chili i had a sample before adding the creams and enjoyed it just as much as the finished product
very tasty flavors were awesome i agree with several of the reviews of it being too soupy next time i39ll take the advice of several and add another can of beans i39ll definitely make this again thanks for a great recipe
wow this was yummy and yes i licked my bowl out lol i did how ever make a few changes because i39m watching my diet and it was still yummy i didn39t put the sour cream in it instead i used plain greek yogert also i didn39t have garlic powder but i did have some garlic so i crushed up 3 cloves i also used 1 milk not whipping cream and i put two cans of bean in and blended up one can of beans so it would be thicker left overs were even better today
my family loved this with every bite they would 34mmmm34 and say 34this is so good you have to make this again34
this recipe was delicious and will be made again this recipe turned out a little soupier than the picture so next time i plan on adding 2 additional cans of northern beans one can of beans pureed to help thicken the chili without adding additional fat and the other can just to add more 39stuff39 into the chili even though i will change a few things for my personal taste this was delicious just 39as is39
i use 3 cans of beans and 3 cans of green chili39s for thicker chili i cant even count how many times ive cooked this it never gets old
this is a favorite of my husband amp mine i add frozen corn to it it39s delicious with corn bread as a side
amazing
my husband doesn39t like lots of beans so i only added one can of beans in exchange i added a can of drained corn i also added 12 c sour cream and 12 c plain lowfat yogurt i also added 3 green onions it turned out great
best while chicken chili i39ve ever had super delicious
easy and the kids loved it one of my favorites
this chili is delicious and very easy to make the sour cream at the end tames the bite of the chili but doesn39t overpower the complementary flavors serve this with a nice hunk of baguette for a tasty lunch
my daughter first made this recipe and it since has become a favorite of everyone i make mine with boneless skinless chicken thighs that my husband smokes with hickoryit makes this chili beyond incredible
i make this quite often and every time i do even folks like my mother who swear they don39t like chicken chili love it i think it is absolutely perfect the only change i make is using fresh garlic and toasting and grinding my own cumin seeds love love love this
i love this recipe although one time i made the mistake of adding jalapenos cans were virtually identical instead of the chilies which made it way too hot for my taste but the rest of the group loves spicy food so it ended up working out i have made it several times since then and everyone loves it
didn39t like it too creamy too rich i didn39t feel good after having it sour cream amp whipping cream is overkill would39ve been better with just whipping cream
even using only 1 can of green chilies it was much too hot for us did not like at all
phenomenal i39m not normally a huge chili fan this is definitely going on my favorites list d
wow used fresh garlic added 2 tlb fresh cilantro and rotisserie chicken rather than cooking my own made day in advance so it sat in the fridge one day wow was awesome and sooooo easythanks a million
outstanding i made this and took the leftovers to workeveryone asked for the recipe and a couple of people went home and made it that night i did make a couple of small changes i used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and because i didn39t have any heavy cream i substituted a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese this was soooooo good can39t wait to make it again thank you for this recipe
my husband says this is the best chili he39s ever had it is delicious this recipe is definatey a keeper
i got this recipe from taste of home years ago and everyone loves it there are never any leftovers we like it with tortilla chips instead of crackers or bread have shared it with church because everyone wants this recipe
excellent this one39s a keeper for sure
a winner with everyone at my house easy to make nice bite without burning on the way down
this is the same recipe my father always made for me although he always used just 1 4oz can of green chilies but the people in my house weren39t very good with hot food 8oz gives enough heat that you can feel it but it39s not too overwhelming friends and family always love it
possibly if this soup was renamed as a bean soup it would be more fitting this soup in no way is a white chili soup very dissapointing
this is great i will make this several more times for sure
its so good its great over rice
i love this recipe i have made it several times and it is a favorite i usually use 3 cans of beans i like more beans in my chilie this is spicey so make sure to have bread handy excellent
made this last month it was a big hit everyone was fighting for the leftovers
i made this as is for a gathering and it was a huge hit even the little ones wanted seconds
this was delicious i used only one can of chilis and used half and half instead of heavy cream it was a hit in my family yum
i loved this very tasty
absolutely amazing will make again and again i will use one can of chilies this time instead though as we are feeding a few kiddos
i added red pepper with onions in the beginning and also added corn with the beans my boyfriend was skeptical about white chili but this recipe is definitely a keeper i will be making this again for sure
everyone at work loved it i made it for a chili cook off and work and i won i made it exactly as the recipe reads only i doubled it great recipe
amazing everyone in my house loves it i have to double the recipesometimes triple it
this is seriously an amazing recipe it was spicy creamy and good on a cold alaskan night next time i will probably use half amp half or 2 milk instead of the heavy cream no salt you dont even need it and greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it more healthy and i am sure it will still be amazing mmmmmm oh and double it if you want a second meal out of it because ours did not make the 7 servings it stated it would
perfect dish for a snow day
made this recipe as written and it was delicious i even got a 34this is really good34 from my husband the taste is wonderful and it is totally going into my recipe box
a favorite i have never made this for company without being asked for the recipedon39t need to tweak a thing
a slight addition of smoked paprika really made this recipe 34pop34 very good stuff thanks
this is such good chili i love it and so does my family

being from a state where beef is what39s for dinner my initial reaction to this recipe was less than excitement but the reviews convinced me to give it a try we really liked it a lot i had to thicken it up a little with some cornstarch to suit my chili tastes next time i make it i will add a vegetable like cabbage or corn to increase the textural diversity but overall this is a really good chili and i will make it again

my wife made this last night she did substitute the white kidney beans for the great northern beans the flavor is excellent for the family and i was able to kick it up a notch with some habanero powder at the table i found the chili to be a little thin for my liking and it would benefit greatly from a rest period to get some more of the flavor into the beans

psuper delicious i had a feeling that with so many positive reviews it would be a hit it39s a challenge to find a dish that my entire family enjoys kids ages 4 and 8 husband and myself but this was a winner creamy hearty perfect for a cold fall evening will be in my normal rotationp
this is the best recipe for banana bread i39ve ever tried i39ve used it for over 20 years it says it doesn39t double well so i tripled it it makes two large loaves after tripling my question is can i substitute pumpkin purée for the bananas to make this into pumpkin bread with the appropriate spices i know i could experiment but i39d rather ask first thank you
sweet and moist i will be making this again
i made this bread with one minor twist i live in fl and i have been collecting fresh mangoes every day on my way to work i only had one ripe banana and a plethora of ripe ripe mangoes so i did 114g of ripe banana puree and 114g of fresh mango puree it turned out super tasty with gorgeous hues i divided the batter into 4 mini loaves and baked for 4045 minutes in my mini bread stone pan until the toothpick came out clean this way i was able to share the love a little further and pass out mini loaves to my coworkers neighboors and friends
in place of the 12 cup of oil i used another 12 cup of mashed banana ate it with a spread of butter on each slice delish
made this for my book club but used sour cream instead of buttermilk which i was out of it came out great they all asked for recipe
this recipe has an amazing flavor i did change a few things 1 i divided my sugar 1 cup white 12 cup brown sugar 2 i also used milk with a tablespoon lemon juice to substitute for the buttermilk that i didn39t have 3 i also lowered my temp to 325 i was using a cast iron bread pan it cooks hotter 4 i only cooked it for 1 hr then let it cool for the 15 minutes loved the parchment paper it definitely made clean up easier thank you for a tasty recipe
i have made this recipe several times my family and neighbors like it at 350 it always burns the bottom and the ends today i was determined to get a good one i started at 350 but after reading some reviews lowered the temperature to 325 that made a nice banana bread not burnt the bread bakes dark also i baked it for 1 hr 10 min given how many people have the burnt ends i think taste of home should make a correction or a comment
best ever banana bread is a great recipe no alterations needed
add 1 tsp cinnamon to dry ingredients and it makes this recipe that much better
best banana bread ever used pecans instead of walnuts as a preference took about 123 in a gas range perfect
anyone ever try the buttermilk substitute for the buttermilk needed use 1 tablespoon of white vinegar plus enough milk to measure 1 cup then divvy out whats needed for the recipe its a frigid day with everyone clamoring for banana bread dont want to trek out to the store
good one
delicious banana bread
perfect banana bread had 3 ripe ones so used them otherwise baked per recipe even the timing very moist looks identical to your pic
i make this so often i have the recipe memorized i usually make 12 of it in muffin tins and the rest in a small loaf pan i individually wrap the muffins with plastic wrap and put in a freezer zip lock bag to freeze it is easy to pull one out and defrost in the microwave my husband loves them for breakfast 34desert34 i usually substitute applesauce for the oil and add cinnamon because my husband loves it sometimes i substitute almond extract for the vanilla
this banana bread tasted great and it was very easy to prepare i love that it uses oil as the fat makes preparation so fast and easy
i was excited to try this recipe followed it to the letter bread didn39t rise properly the sides and bottom were burned and the middle was still mush i greased my pans really heavily so it would not stick still stuck i39m only giving this 2 stars because it was an easy recipe what a waste of ingredients we couldn39t even eat it
the title is not a lie agree this is the best banana bread very simple ingredients and easy to make the only thing i changed is the buttermilk which i substituted to vanilla yogurt since i do not have buttermilk at home it taste so delicious and moist i cooked about 1 hr and 10 mins cooled it down and wrapped in a foil and placed in the refrigerator and it was perfect yummy banana bread ever
i have made this bread large and small loaves and muffins many times and it has turned out perfect everytime i always use whole wheat flour and brown sugar and or a little honey and cut back on they sugar a little i also add blueberries dried cherries apple and rhubarb sometimes separately or in some combination they also add some sweetness so i can reduce the sugar and extra moisture to compensate for the whole wheat flour the best banana bread anywhere and everyone that eats mine says the same thing thank you for sharing a great recipe
i have not tried this recipe yet however i would suggest using a scale and measure the ingredients before mixing i was taught this by my mom i made a directory of all itemsflour sugar oats nutsexample flour one cup is 414 oz quick oatsone cup 282 ozand so forthmight be worth checking it out
i have used this recipe for almost 30 years it is the best for those that have had problems i have used wide pan loaf pans it does cook dark but if you cook for 1 hour 20 minutes at 325 rotating half way through you will be successful try adding mini morsels also want to store in a zip top bag and refrigerate enjoy
great taste on this bread but i39ve tried it a couple times and i39m having the same issue as a previous reviewer the sides brown way to much long before the loaf is done i tried doubling the recipe and making 3 loaves to cut the cook time but still had the same problem maybe ill try muffins out of it next time
gin sorry your bread failed i had that problem too during covid i was t able to get my usual flour aid i settled for an different brand it failed every time now i have my gold medal allpurpose flour again and terrific try gold medal this really is the best recipe ever tried
followed recipe exactly and first time using this recipe i was very disappointed in how it turned out did not raise and edges burned even tho39 i thought it a good idea to loosely cover with foil once i saw the edges browning this was supposed to be a gift but could not in good conscience give it to anyone have not tasted it yet but in the future will go back to my reliable standby recipe which i thought was lost but have since found as something is not quite right with this one
i try a variety of banana bread recipes and this 1 is easy and everyone loves ir my husband said that we could stay with this recipe from now on
ok i make banana bread at least twice a month with the old bananasas we never manage to eat a full bunch so yes this is a good basic recipe and yes i changed a bunch i added butter instead of canola oil one stick added a 14 teaspoon of nutmeg yes and three bananas instead of two did not have butter milk but used a 14 cup of almond milk how did it taste lol i will let you know
wonderfully easy and delicious
i had 4 ripe bannas so i used all of them in this recipe used cake flour i did not have butter milk but made my own with heavy cream and white vinegar which turned into a sour cream consistency used banna extract and vanilla omitted the nuts poured into bundt pan for some reason some of it stuck to the sides of the pan so will try loaf pan w parchment next timemade a frosting with heavy cream powder sugar pinch salt cinnamon this was a hit i will definitely use this recipe again
i made this recipe into muffins yield 12 medium sized and 8 mini muffins i swapped 1 cup of the sugar for splenda and used 12 cup of regular sugar i added mini chocolate chips and 12 cup of walnuts excellent will make it into a loaf next time as well
this really is the best banana bread recipe actually i use the pampered chef brownie pan and make muffins using the recipe makes 24 and baking time is about 15 minutes i lessen the sugar to 1 cup sometimes i add mini chocolate chips i also use this recipe with ground zucchini using the full amount of sugar i grind or finely grate the zucchini and squeeze out the moisture
this is the easiest and best tasting banana bread ever i put raisins in one loaf and blueberries in another yum
this is definitely the best banana bread i have ever made i made extra loafs to give to family members and they all raved about how good it was on some loaves i did add a little nutmeg and cinnamon and it also tasted good with those spices either way this is the best banana bread
this is the one i have been looking for finally after 2 years
this by far is the best banana bread i39ve made in fact much less time consuming than ones i39ve used in the past i included half a cup of dark semisweet chocolate chips which made a delicious combination with the walnuts this one is a keeper
i39ve been a fan of banana bread ever since i was a child and this one is delicious i substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts which my husband and i enjoyed
one of the easiest banana breads i39ve ever made my kids even helped make it and it turned out perfect we opted to make it gluten
this really is the best banana bread i did add an extra small banana and used toasted pecans because that is what i had this is moist and flavorful it39s everything you want and hope in a banana bread normally with a slice of banana bread i butter it this is so good i didn39t need the butter
very easy moist and delicious a keeper for sure
i use 1 cup of bananas whatever nuts i have on hand sometimes i add 15 cups blueberries takes longer to cook sometimes apples i like to cook these in miniloave pans i get four out of the recipe for blueberry i cooked for 4045min all others 3035mins
love this recipe i never liked banana bread but this recipe has changed my mind i have mad it several times now and also gave a loaf to relatives who also loved it easy to make and freezes well my mom likes to slice and bag it separately for the freezer then she has a snack that thaws quickly i would do the same but we wind up eating it all before i can freeze any definitely recommend trying this recipe
very good recipe delish question i would like to add chocolate chips instead of the walnuts grandkids prefer the chocolate chips how much would i add 1 cup like the chopped walnuts and what about a mixture of chocolate chips and nuts 12 cup of each
i made the recipe as given but substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts and baked in paper lined muffin pans this recipe made 18 regular size muffins these were very moist and delicious i will definitely make these again
so delicious and easy to make you can put add ins if you want to change it up for your family but it is good just as written will file this one for future use
absolutely delicious this really is the best banana bread mine baked at 325 for about an hour and a half i used the chocolate chip option instead of walnuts and threw in a handful of leftover toffee bits as well this bread is moist on the inside with a crispy crust on the outside can39t say enough about it we loved it and will definitely make again vfe
true the best banana bread that ever made or tasted i used pecans as what i had on hand muffins great idea be sure to use a larger loaf sized pan baking time varies my bake time over an hour vfe a must try
my favorite banana bread recipe i make it as muffins which bake for around 24 minutes delicious
i love this banana bread never ever had i used a different recipe
it was wonderful i made two loaves and put chocolate chips in one they were both delicious this recipe will be added to my 34favorite34 recipes
i have used a lot of different recipes but this one is by far the best my mom always put the bread on a paper plate when almost completely cooled and placed into a sealed plastic bag overnight and it makes it so moist i will use this recipe again
as advertised this recipe truly is the best banana bread ever since finding this recipe a month ago i have made three loaves my husband can not eat it fast enough i shortened the cooking time to 1 hour 10 minutes i think it depends on the type of pan you results are amazing definitely will cook again and again
delicious and tasty used 14 cup less sugar and it was plenty sweet husband says 34it a keeper34 shared with family thank you
so easy and tasty this truly is delicious the taste that i was looking for we39ve toasted our slices and had it with butter and it was simply delish thank you for the recipe for the first time ever i wish i had more bananas to bake more breads
made this cake twice first time we fond too sweet too much sugar second time wait better as i put just i cup of sugar did put a bet of coconut essence to give an extra taste it is a very easy cake to make and very good did not have butter milk so i put yogurt a slice of it is now my husband favorite breakfast
i haven39t actually put this recipe to the test yet because we just installed a different oven last night and i still need to clean it but the main reason is that i have a special needs diet so i will have to substitute almost every ingredient in order to be able to eat it safely i39m not sure if anyone else out there is a vegandiabetic with no immune system but if you are then you39ve got a friend the good news is that so far the things i have made substitutions for have been on me and my family so i will be happy to share the rating and the substitutions used if anyone is interestedor i could just write a book lol
best flavored banana bread i have ever had the english walnuts add that special crunch and flavor this is a keeper i didn39t change a thing it will replace my regular banana bread recipe thank you
good recipe i substituted 14 cup brown sugar plus 1 14 cup white sugar i also slightly toasted and cooled the walnuts prior to folding them into the batter i buttered the pan and coated it with flour as well i like the buttermilk the texture was outstanding i will make this often
i39ve tried many 34best banana bread34 recipes but this one really is best it is very moist and i39ve found others too dry for my liking i did the recipe as written except had 3 bananas that needed to be used flavor is good and makes large loaf i will definitely be making again
banana bread has never been my favorite turns out i had the wrong recipe after making this it39s now my favorite title didn39t lie this is the best ever banana bread
not even close to the best banana bread i followed the recipe verbatim so i didn39t add numerous additional ingredients and say i made the recipe as a matter of fact i made a better loaf yesterday using a different recipe that was also called the best banana bread the recipe simply doesn39t have enough bananas in it its a nice bread but has limited banana flavor i would suggest looking for a different recipe
i have used this recipe for yearswith the addition of cinnamon nutmeg cloves and ginger i personally find banana bread boring without the spice i also add walnuts and sometimes chocolate chips to batter the best base recipe in use this for making pumpkin bread or zucchini it freezes very well and often is better once thawed out
this is without a doubt the best banana nut bread recipe i have ever found i always have bananas and have made countless different recipes but never found one i really liked until i made this one i followed the directions from start to finish and wouldn39t change a thing this bread is so moist and has the best flavor i would completely agree with it39s namebest ever banana nut bread
this is so easy and delicious
my family and i loved the bread i used pecans instead of walnuts i only used 14 cup of buttermilk i understand how an extra tablespoon could make a difference i will definitely make again
excellent ad easy i sprinkled some sugar on top and it was excellent with our morning coffee i said was it was gone fast i will be making this regularly
the title says it all i use brown sugar instead of white i leave out the nuts just a personal preference sometimes i add chocolate chips in place of the nuts
this banana bread is outstanding i have never had better and so simple to make i have made at least 6 times with a perfect outcome each bake i do use 2 12 mashed bananas and like another viewer use just a touch of sugar on top before baking any banana bread i39ve ever tried was too dry but not this one super moist and sooooo delicious winner here i highly recommend cnaquin
this banana bread is very good and moist made it several times with and without the nuts and everytime tasty the cook time might be a bit long bc mine comes out a little darker than expect but the taste is still really good regardless
just as it says 34the best ever banana nut bread34 i have made this nut bread six times three times for friends and three for myself i did however use coconut rum and vanilla extract one teaspoon each and raw cane sugar instead of regular sugar the very best i39ve ever had
this was delicious i made one with chocolate chips and the other with toasted walnuts
this is now my go to recipe for banana bread we made a loaf with chocolate chips and a loaf with walnuts excellent
love love love this recipe and was so easy to make moist and delicious gone in a couple of hours
awesome recipe simple and delicious
turned out well
i love this banana bread i make it exactly like it says and it comes out amazing everytime i make it for every family gathering they all love it thank you so much for sharing your recipe
absolutely scrumptious fixed this today and the aroma filled the house i plan on giving this as gifts for the holidays
perfect banana bread just as written however due to health reasons i have successfully substituted coconut milk for the buttermilk reduced the sugar to 1cup and reduced the oil to 14 cup by adding an extra banana and just for personal taste and to look pretty i like to sprinkle the walnuts mixed with a bit of sugar on the top of the bread just prior to baking
cant see the entire recipe
i was in a rush and wanted something quick for banana breadi love this recipe the bread was moist and delicious super quick to mix just a note when i have buttermilk i use milk w cider vinegar 1 cup milk to 1 tbs vinegar it works just as well in a pinch
i have made every banana bread you can think of and this is our favorite thank you to the author i also only use the recipe exactly as written people please rate if you change it
hi i love this recipe i don39t always have buttermilk so i use yoghurt and i freeze banana39s when on special and slice them into the melted butter mix and everyone loves it
just okay it39s your average banana bread
i put it together in minutes so it is a quick way to use overripened bananas i do like sugar so i added the recipe amount as well as topped it with demerara cane sugar just so it looks pretty when baked i did add craisins raisins and pecans to the mixture as well
when i took it out of the oven i wasn39t too excited with how dark the bread was and the fact that it caved in the center some looking at the picture i see that one caved in the center some as well i did add more flour because of our altitude perhaps i needed to add a little more it is a very sweet bread and not the usual banana bread flavor that i prefer but my husband was very happy with it he commented several times that it was good bread i do like how moist it is the main thing to note is it39s a 34sweet34 bread and despite the darkness of it when it comes from the oven and tastes fine and is moist
i added 12 cup soaked raisins mmmm
very nice banana bread extremely easy and quick to make i doubled the recipe and instead of sugar i used a sugar substitute called whole earth sweetener co so i only needed half of the amount of sugar because it39s very sweet i baked it in a round 23cm pan on 165 degrees i39m in australia for 15 hours and for the last 10 minutes i had to cover it with a piece of foil to stop it browning too much it39s quite moist and flavourful perfect with a cuppa next time i might add some cinnamon to the mix before bakinghmmmmmm thank you for a beautiful recipe my four children lloovveedd it my 10 year old ate at least 5 pieces in one sitting very good
delicious
i love this banana bread i39ve made many times i don39t think it39s too sweetin fact i always add a glaze i also usually use pecans instead of walnutsbut i39ve made with both
i just love this banana bread which in my version is more like a cake don39t like walnuts so i use pecans and then i throw in a good handful of dark chocolate chips yum yum
this banana bread recipe is delicious i give it a 5star rating even though it was a bit too sweet next time i39ll try omitting 14 or 12 cup of sugar
this is my go to banana bread recipe made the following changes reduced sugar to 13 cup sugar added 13 cup of brown sugar 12 tea of baking powder used melted coconut oil for canola oil my bread only took 4550 minutes to bake at 325 due to nut allergies l don39t add nuts
excellent
as written this has far too much sugar for my taste 1 c was plenty the 2nd time aroundespecially since i used 3 bananas that were black reducing the sugar and upping the banana by 1 gives far more banana flavor black bananas are much sweeter so no sweetness is losti think i will stick to my normal recipe sorry
delicious we like our banana bread with a strong banana taste so i used 1 12 cups of mashed bananas and followed the rest of the recipe as is
this is really the best recipe for banana bread i made this bread many times with the great result every time when i tested this bread i followed the recipe exactly did no substitutions and my bread turned out perfect easy to make and delicious i made this bread with substitutions too yogurt or sour cream for buttermilk raisin for nuts more spices and it has never failed my expectations i highly recommend this recipe you will not be disappointed
i made this recipe as is no changes or substitutions i found it to be moist and delicious loaded with banana flavor highly recommended
have not made this would like to know what recipe to follow did any one make it by the original recipe and how many star did it get
so when people give this recipe 5 stars and have altered 8 of the 10 ingredients called for they are really giving themselves the highest rating this makes me so angry make the recipe the way it is submitted and give credit to the author
this was the first thing i have ever baked from scratch and it was incredibly delicious six stars in my book
i made this delicious loaf today and it is a winner i made only two minor changes i substituted sour cream for the buttermilk which i did not have and used pecans i opted to sprinkle chopped pecans over the loaf just before popping it in the oven we love this bread and i will be making it many more times i highly recommend this recipe volunteer field editor
i have been using this recipe for years on end whenever my bananas are ripe and it has never failed my expectations i substitute the canola oil with safflower oil only put in 1 cup of sugar and use 1 more banana than recommended instead of using buttermilk which i never have in my fridge i use half and half and it works perfectly finelove love love this recipe it39s totally worth a shot
great recipe i also altered it as recommended by other users i only used 12c sugar as my banana39s were really ripe i used three banana39s and added 1tsp of cinnamon and used 14c of coconut oil my bread was done after 40min so keep your eye on it as it does not take over an hour to bake next time i might add baking powder as mine didn39t come out as high and fluffy as i would have liked it

this is amazing i made a few adjustments based on other reviews and believe that everyone in my family likes it even my daughter who said banana lol she loved itmy adjustmentsi substituted 14 of the white sugar with brown sugar used 2 12 bananas and reduced oil to 14 cup used 1 tsp vanilla paste for the vanilla added 1 tsp cinnamon and a tiny pinch of ginger and nutmeg it does take quite awhile to bake but be patient totally worth it
i have been making this bread for many years i double the recipe and do two 9x5 loaf pans i always start my timer for 45 minutes and then start checking the bread after that for doneness it truly is the best ever banana bread
i have a similar recipe use 1 cup sugar 34 cup oil and bake in 3 smaller pans which are great as gifts or to keep in the freezer i spray the bottom of the three pans and sprinkle with oatmeal to keep from sticking bake at 335 degrees for 3536 minutes my husband likes blueberries rather then nutsso good hard to keep them on hand
omg make sure you grease and flour the two 2 pans you will need one pan is not enough for this much dough and it does not take 1 14 to 1 12 hours to bake 45 to 55 min is more then plenty to bake 2 loaves enjoy
a really really good recipe i usually tried recipes that are labeled but i had the ingredients for this one the bread is moist is has the right texture and strong banana flavor a definnite winner i used a scant cup on the oil simply because i ran out and it was still very moist
in the oven now sure smells good baking i checked at one hour and was still gooey in center checked again in 5 minutes as suggested by another reviewer and it was done i had lined the loaf pan with parchment paper so i cooled for 10 minutes and lifted it out to finish cooling smells and looks delicious my whole house smells like bananas
this turned out wonderfully i used bananas that were black to get a great banana flavori think i may try less sugar next time perhaps 1 cup
this is my favorite banana bread recipe i think my family lets the bananas turn brown so i will make this lol the only thing i do is dust the pansi always double it and put 1 loaf in the freezer with cinnamon amp sugar yummmmmmmy
i will never look for another banana bread recipe this one completely lives up to its name
this is definitely the best banana bread i39ve ever tasted my whole family loves it
whenever i have extra bananas this is the recipe i reach for to make banana nut bread in fact i have shared it 5 times with different friends it39s that good
omitted the walnuts due to allergies sprinkled turbinado sugar on top before baking it disappeared fast definitely will double the recipe next time
i39ve been making this recipe for years i found it in a church cookbook i39m now famous for this recipe among my family friends and coworkers it39s so moist unlike most banana bread recipes yes it comes out dark it has sort of chewy crust that everyone loves i can39t say enough about this recipe it39s absolutely the best
this recipe is fast easy and delicious i also used less sugar and oil than specified along with extra banana and milk i also used half brown sugar instead of all white and i added some cinnamon and allspice i love the idea of putting some of the nuts on top before baking i39ll be sure to do that next time also i made 12 muffins and that baking time was about 3540 min yummy
i gave this recipe three stars as 1 canola oil is so unhealthy i used organic coconut oil instead plus about a tablespoon of butter 2 i used 12 cup of sugar and used 3 large overripe bananas instead of two i didn39t measure but it was probably more than the 1 cup of bananas called for in the recipe in addition because of the extra banana i was able to cut the eggs down to one but i did use a large eggi added 12 cup raisins and 12 cup chocolate chips as my family likes that but they aren39t necessary as i tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet i wasn39t sure about baking it at 325 degreesso halfway through i upped it to 350 degrees i don39t think it made any differencebut i do have a convection oven
my grandson 5 and i love this recipe he loves that we have a dry bowl and a wet bowl sometimes when our bananas enough we will pick up some organic banana baby food works great he calls it our banana buck bread we like pecans as our instead of walnuts
this is by far the worse recipe i have used for banana breadit calls for way too much oili bake dog treats for a living and they smell better than this bread
i really wanted some banana bread but did not have a 34go to34 recipe i trust taste of home so i came here to look for one this one rocks easy recipe with basic ingredients turned out great it39s a keeper
i39ve tried all kinds of banana bread muffins and bread recipes and always a flop this one was easy and minimal ingredients i used a metal pan all i had and cooked for 110 hours 25 regular bananas omg it was fabulousi will make it again and recommend to any and all novice cooks
our family loves this recipe so much that i keep the right amount of buttermilk frozen in baggies just so i will have it on hand when our bananas get a little too ripe and i make this bread my grandson suddenly stopped eating bananas and as it turned out he was letting them get 34too old34 so we would have banana bread
i have made this banana bread more times than i can count it39s the only recipe i use and as my husband is a diabetic i make it with 1 cup of splenda it is plenty sweet and delicious besides the walnuts i sometimes add craisins
very good recipe but on the sugar i used 34 brown sugar and 34 regular white sugar i also added 12 tsp cinnamon
emily thank you for adding your comment of using 3 bananas amp not adding the oil this is great less calories there is added value when adjustments are made to the recipe this helps to cut down on calories or use substitutes very much appreciated
i have made this several times and everyone who has eaten this says 34this is the best banana bread they have ever eaten34 if i don39t have buttermilk i will use milk with about a tb of vinegar and it still has been great this is very moist and delicious
i have been making this very recipe since the 347039s34 and everyone loves it got it in the newspaper detroit news the very best banana bread for sure
my family loves this recipe ask for it regularly
my absolute favorite recipe i add extra bananas if i have them and keeps it extra moist i also use powdered buttermilk to make the 14 cup buttermilk so i always have buttermilk available in my kitchen highly recommend this recipe
ok i39ll admit i hate it when someone submits a review and is either challenging the authenticity based on the recipe name versus the ingredients used or has not even made the recipe or has made it and says 34but i made changes34 so what am i about to do lol i am going to tell you that i love this recipe although the version that i was given does not use the buttermilk walnuts or vanilla uses 12 tsp baking soda 2 tsp baking powder and reduces the sugar to 34 cup all else is the same i know it39s not the same right i do love nuts in my banana bread and i have added them in the past the buttermilk however adds a dairy product that my wife doesn39t tolerate well lactose intolerant so for those of you looking for a nondairy version i suspect you can omit the buttermilk from this recipe and still have an awesome result
isn39t that called banana nut bread
i loved this i had three bananas i needed to use up so i replaced the canola oil with another banana it came out so moist and delicious
i just made this today from a previous reviewer i also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and this is the best banana nut bread i made this is a keeper thanks for sharing
i39ve tried a lot of banana bread recipes and this really is the best ever
this is the best banana nut bread that i have ever eaten
i made it for my clients and they asked for it again and again so tonight i39m making it again
fantastic old fashion recipe i did decrease the sugar to 1 cup as to make it healthierand could not tell the difference just like grandmas
the name says it all second to none in my book delicious
just made today delicious
i love this recipe i39ve used it dozens of times and it always turns out sometimes i add choc chips or coconut and it is always delicious and moist i use half the sugar and use vanilla flavoured stevia drops in place of vanilla it adds enough sweetness i also use whole wheat flour i replace the oil with apple sauce even with all these exchanges it turns out great
i have hard time calling this the 34best ever34 it took 30 min longer than estimated to bake and the top was all crusty and dark because of the high amount of sugar i also made a batch of the basic banana bread muffins and preferred that recipe a lot more
my husband loves this banana bread i often substitute chocolate chips for the walnuts and serve it as a dessert
i live at 7200 ft and didn39t modify other than swapping pecans for walnuts out of preference and it turned out great for anyone else at high altitude who might be wondering only cooked it for about 1 hr10 min delicious i was concerned about the top getting too dark as one commenter stated as that often happens to me with baking but it was right in the center of my oven and came out perfectly browned
it is the best recipie ever i even used 3 old frozen runny bananas and it was delicious
didn39t change a thing
perfect
i love this recipe it is easy to mix together and the end result tastes great i like to wrap the cooled loaf in foil and let it sit overnight prior to servingeating as this makes it much more most this banana bread is so good
my family loves this bread sometimes i replace the walnuts with pecans or mini chocolate chips but otherwise make it according to the recipe
this is my favorite banana bread recipe it always comes out perfect
the taste and texture of this banana bread is perfect and my family loved it my personal preference is for the top crust to not be as dark i couldn39t get the bread to cook all the way through without the top getting a dark brown i made 2 loaves and put a piece of foil over one of them and it still turned out a dark brown as i said that is my personal preference
wonderful
this is my go to banana bread never lasts long around here
this was very good i omit the nuts but it really had nice flavor i reduced the cook time by about 10 minutes i did the toothpick test on my smaller loaf pan just in case then decided to check the larger as well they were both done
best banana bread everi39ve been using this recipe for five years now or but never actually submitted a review and the very first time i made it i fell in love i39m very picky with my banana breads true story this is always my goto recipe to give away as treats to familyfriends or to make and keep at home but it doesn39t last very long i39ve made it exactly the way it shows in the recipe and it39s amazing being the curious and advanced chefbaker that i am i changed a few ingredients to 34health34 it up a bit you39re welcome to adopt my style here39s what i didused 1 cup unbleached flour and 34 cup whole wheat i39ve also used gluten free flour blend and it works just as well used 12 cup white or raw organic sugar 12 cup brownused 12 cup avocado oil instead of veg or canola no taste diff and so much healthiermade my own buttermilk 12 cup milk with 12 tablespoon vinegar stir and let sit 5 mins discard a bit to give just over 14 cupmix well stir in mini chocolate chips or 60 dark chunks and poof magic an unbelievable healthy and delicious banana bread i bake at 325f for 65 mins everytimebon appetite
very nice texture and flavor takes a long long time to cook more than the usual banana bread recipe the crust on the outside of the bread turned out a little thick though i did not burn it will most likely make again and experiment with the baking temperature
one of the best recipes i39ve tried bread was moist kids and nephews ate it all up will definitely be making this againif you39re going to be making mini loaves like i did you39ll need to set your timer to 30 minutes instead of1 hour
i have been on the hunt for a good banana bread recipe my husband has hated every recipe i have made and only likes his grandmas i got his grandmas recipe and made it and guess what did it turn out like grandmas no i tried this recipe last night i used 34 of the all mixed finished batter and put hat into a loaf pan the remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins i did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for 2 loafs this recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans but my sister swore by this no the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked this was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan i sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist most breads come out too dry when i use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time my sister was right thanks sis the bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this amazing recipe i kept a eye on the bread after a half hour and did the tooth pick trick to see when my bread was done finally i have a banana bread recipe i will be excited to add to our family favs cook book
i made this yesterday it39s gone today it definitely has the right name it was absolutely the best banana bread ever the second time i made it today i changed one thing i halved the amount of nuts and added dark chocolate chips for the other half it also was exceptionally delicious the original recipe is so moist and light not oily and mushy like a lot of recipes thank you so much for another of your recipes all i have tried have become big hits with my family
we love this recipe it is the only banana bread recipe i use i have a nut allergy so i never add the walnuts but sometimes i add chocolate chips sometimes i add 14 cup cocoa and chocolate chips sometimes i add fresh blueberries sometimes i don39t add anything no matter how it is made it turns out great sometimes i even make them as muffins such a great recipe
we just love this bread
my go to recipe for banana bread excellent as written i have double it and used a tube cake pan for easier presentation over time i have left out the nuts and added 1 tsp cinnamon for our household preference
best ever
great recipe i didn39t have buttermilk so i used my unsweetened coconut milk and didn39t have canola oil so i used olive oil unsure of how it would turn out and everyone loved it next time i think i will do 14 c less sugar as it is plenty sweet this is the one i will use from now on it took 1 hr 25 min
not only did i roast the bananas but the walnuts as well i also added chocolate chips yummy recipe i will make this one again and again i freeze my buttermilk into ice cube trays so it is always handy
great recipe but way too much sugar for our liking i made a double batch this time and used 1c sugar toral i always add cinnamon with a sprinkle of nutmeg i dont ever have buttermilk so i always use milk and vinegar with great results made 1 loaf pan and 2 mini loaves minis took about 50 mins large took 1 hr 15 mins delish
while i am not a huge fan of just plain banana bread i must say this one is good i did add cinnamon to the batter because my family loves it i didn39t add any nuts because dd doesn39t like them however i would add pecans if i were making this to give away husband and i prefer pecans but that is just a preference thing will definitely make again
next time i will try only one cup sugar i didn39t have any buttermilk so added 12 tsp of cream of tartar to the milk the only other change i made was using saffola instead of canola my grandson suggests adding chocolate chips next time as he likes them in everything really good and very moist
best of all my banana bread recipes
absolutely amazing i always make mini loafs to share the deliciousness thank you for sharing
love this recipe
this is the best banana bread ever it never turned out so good before i like it because fluffy and the bananas as good to eat anymore but when i baked it it turned out delicious i give it 5 stars
i make this any time i have bananas that are really ripe it39s really good
excellent recipe i skipped the nuts because i didn39t have any and it still turned out tasty next time i will make sure i have walnuts because i39m sure it will be even better i read the reviews and decided to use only 1 cup of sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon this is now my go to banana bread recipe very fast and easy
i followed the directions exactly except for adding 1 cup of hershey cinnamon chips along with the walnuts came out amazing
i have used a recipe very similar to this one since 1966 mine uses 1 stick of margarine instead of oil only 1 cup of sugar 3 mashed bananas not 2 and no buttermilk or vanilla plus i39ve always used pecans and not walnuts but that is a matter of preference instead of bread i often make miniature muffins and we love the muffins
this is really a great recipe i know that all our ovens bake differently but if you check your bread at the one hour mark then 5 minute intervals after that this bread won39t over cook at one hour it39s still really wet inside but it firms up really fast after that mine was done at 1 hour 10 minutes and was perfect i hope that helps
i tried 2 different recipesi bought bananas and totally forgot i had them so i had a bunch and figured i could freeze some of the bread this recipe is great another time i will use an extra banana and do half white sugar half brown the other recipe i tried had all brown sugar and was also wonderful but i39m thinking a mix of the 2 might be just righti always try a recipe as printed before making changesso glad i did with this one
i have made banana bread over the years and this is the best recipe i have ever tried i need not look further this is it
very tasty banana bread i cut the sugar down to less than one cup i will definitely make this again
it was decent i think too much sugar for my taste
the best
this is one of the best i cut back on the sugar to one cup i did not have buttermilk so i used milk mixed with some lemon juice i used pecans since i did not have walnuts it was easy to prepare and came out perfect after 1 hour 15 min will make this again soon this one did not last long
in my opinion this is not the best ever banana bread there is one in a southern living cookbook which is the best i have had
not only did i cut the sugar back to a cup i also replaced 34 cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour and it still turned out wonderful
after 30yrs of using the same banana bread recipe i39ve switched to this recipe my daughters agree with me this is the 34bestever banana bread34 except for adding a teaspoon of banana flavoring we followed the recipe exactlyit was so quick amp easy i didn39t even need the mixer only a measuring cup bowl amp wisk
i always bake banana bread and its recipe is fool proofi tried this recipe last night and i am sorry to say it was not a very good one it took 2 hours and still it was soggy so maybe if we put less buttermilk in it result might be different i like the taste of it tough nasira mansoor
very good cut back on the sugar to 1 cup
my 212 year old granddaughter and i made this bread today she loves dumping in the ingredients after i measure it was easy and moist and delicious made as directed except added some cinnamon it made 4 mini loaves and baked for 35 minutes
i thought this was very good and even better with a tsp of cinnamon added will definitely make again
i39ve made this recipe several times and it is excellent on the 3rd morning after making it we had 4 slices left and i used them to make banana nut french toast topped with powdered sugar and if you like syrup i also do this with carrot nut bread give it a try
i just made this banana bread and it is delicious my honey likes a warm slice with butter on it he kept asking for a piece before it cooled off i will be making this bread over and over again

doubled the recipe and it came out very well the best banana cake ever thank you
followed recipe to a tset oven to 325 and baked for an hourchecked with toothpick methodleft in for another 15 min as directedbread came out hard as a rockcould not cut it with any knife in my kitchenhad to use hack saw to cut itnever again
best banana bread made it for my office did not think that the men would notice that i left out the walnuts believe me the men sure did tell me the next time i made the bread i39m to add the walnuts
this is by far the best banana bread ever i have made this for farmers market and it sold out right away each time moist flavorful and wonderful taste i will never use another recipe for banana bread
i have been making this bread formore than 15 years i add a few handfuls of chocolate chips it makes a 5 star a 6
we love this bread with or without nuts it is wonderful
this is for sure the best ever banana bread it disappeared in one sitting thank you for your recipe gert
there are three people in my house and this never lasts more than two days it39s wonderfully moist exactly as it is i tried to use whole grain once only once and it didn39t rise nearly as well and it was a little drier also i wait until the bananas are 45 days old and mushy and cut the sugar back by 14 cup it39s still just as sweet and it cuts out a few calories
this is the best banana bread recipe my mom gives me ripe bananas so she can get a loaf
i used coconut oil and coconut milk and added coconut and cranberries the best bread ever
i took this bread to my church breakfast and it got rave reviews from everyone i had many requests for the recipe it is very moist and delicious
i made this per directions and its title fits the finished product it is a keeper texture is great very moist i used black walnuts but any nut of choice or no nuts would be just as good the baking time stated is a bit long for my oven i would suggest testing before the stated baking time mine baked in an hour i always remove breads while still warm not hot allowing a bread to completely cool sometimes increases sticking cutting a piece of waxed paper the size of the pan bottom eliminates the risk of sticking although i didn39t do it this time and had no problems
this is the most delicious recipe for a change i will add 1 bag of chocolate chips i always replace 14 cup of sour cream for the buttermilk it makes the bread very moist and flavorful
i agree this is a wonderful recipe the buttermilk makes a big difference my recipe is almost 30 years old and uses a stick of oleo instead of oil 12 cup of buttermilk and only 1 cup sugar it never fails to please
i have tried many banana bread recipes this one is just outstanding and the banana flavor is just awesome
the best banana bread i ever hadsuper moist
such a tastiest banana bread ever the best recipe and easy to make thanks toh
this really is the best banana bread i have made it is delicious and easy to make i39m getting rid of all of my old banana bread recipes thanks i tried to give this 5 stars but it didn39t happen
delicious i have been on the lookout for a reallyreally good banana bread recipe and this is it super easy and great texture i didn39t have walnuts but chopped almonds were just as good you won39t be sorry
great flavor and great texture will definitely make this one again when i want a banana nut bread i used pecans instead of walnuts cuz that is what i keep in my freezer
this has become my family39s goto recipe for banana bread we all love the tremendous flavor
this is the first time i used someone elses recipe and not my own that i have used for years flavor was ok but each one of my 8 little loafs all stuck to the bottom of the pan i will be going back to my recipe sorry
this is the best best best banana bread i followed the recipe except i used coconut oil and i added some unused chocolate chips it did overflow in the 9in x 5in loaf pan so next time i39ll put some batter in muffin cups the flavor was perfect i made this last week and meant to save the recipe well i forgot so today i was searching the internet for over an hour trying to find the recipe finally i used my internet history and found it thank you for this version very tasty
this is the best banana bread i have ever made and the only recipe i will use from now on i do admit that i have made a couple of changes use melted unsalted butter instead of oil reduced the sugar to 1 cup increased the number of bananas to three increased the buttermilk by another tbsp added some cinnamon and left out the nuts but the recipe also works well as written i prefer to bake mine in a 8 12 x 4 12 pan for 1 hour and 10 minutes delicious
i took the suggestion of one of the readers and used a toffee bar instead of the nuts wonderful flavor but even though the pan was sprayed the candy sunk to the bottom of it amp i mean it stuck most of it had to be soaked off next time i will do it without the toffee bar
wow this banana bread really is the best i39ve ever had i39m not a big nut eater so i changed those out for milk chocolate toffee bits my family is doing backflips just go ahead and double the recipe you will definitely want an extra loaf if just to share with another lucky family enjoy
i made this but may have made a mistake doubling the recipe to accommodate my bounty of overripe bananas i thought my pans were the right size but one of the loaves ran over in the oven and even though i greased the already nonstick pans i couldn39t get either loaf out of the pan intact having said that the flavor was good and i will try the recipe again and readjust my star level
i reduced the sugar to 1 cup as per suggestions i reduced the oil by half and replaced it with more banana and some applesauce i also replaced almost all the flour with whole wheat flour a healthier version that still tasted great the kids loved it
great recipe it is a bit sweeter than i would like since this is my husband39s favorite i39m making it for the second time this week i did add a dash of cinnamon
amazing i added cinnamon and an extra banana i am going to get mini loaf pans and then double the recipe then make it i will say how it goes
the whole family loves this bread outstanding recipe
i read every review and then made my version i added 1tsp cinnamon and nutmeg tothe flour 1cup sugar 3bananas 1stk melted butter 1tsp banana extract baked it70minutes goes without saying this is absolutely the best ever banana bread my husband loved it so much before going to bed i sliced a piece buttered it and left itfor him to toast next morning have bought more bananas to ripen for another loaf
it was okay but to sweet for my taste
this is great and easy to make i did add an extra banana which made it more moist but it is not needed i also used 4 mini loaf pans and baked them 40 minutes i have made other banana breads and this is my favorite
simply outstanding i searched for a banana bread made with oil rather than butter so this fit the bill no mixer needed just stir until blended and bake i reduced sugar to 1 14 cups and substituted banana extract in place of vanilla the combination of oil in place of butter and lower baking temperature yielded a tall moist and flavorful loaf
the whole family loves this bread as a breakfast item or a midnight snack sliced a half inch thick toasted with a little butter it39s heaven on a platei would have given 5 stars but i think 15 cups sugar is too much cut back on the pure cane a bit and this bread is a winner
this banana bread truly is amazing my husband and kids can39t get enough of it i always double the recipe so can make two loaves i also use 6 bananas because i love the banana flavor and i leave out the walnuts wonderful recipe
having loved bananas but about 6 or 7 years i find i have what i can only call an 39allergy to any type of raw bananas39 so after experimenting i know i can eat dried banana chips and banana breadcakes this recipe works for me so as i needed a super quick and easy recipe that works i found this one brilliant and though i39m not used to the us electric fahrenheit 32539f measure i just converted it to centigrade 16016539c in the uk i would use a gas oven gas mark 3 on with my version of the cake as one of my son prefers chocolate cake and hubby always likes nuts of some type in his cake i too added cinnamon amp sliced my bananas to save extra washing up dishes but then added chocolate fondant walnuts and cadbury39s drinking chocolate i reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup due to the sugar in the fondant i had no chocolate in the cupboards added a little milk approx a quarter cup and a drop more oil to keep the cake moist it turned out fine not quite as moist and squidgy as the usual banana chocolate cake you39d expect but whoever tasted it say its perfectly fine result everone39s is happy and said basically what a 39yummylishious39 cake
i have been making this recipe for years and years originally from the taste of home magazine it is the best banana bread recipe i have ever tried and is my staple one whenever i bring this in to work everyone swarms around it be sure your bananas are very ripe and it will make the bread moist and sweet i39ve even tried it with some natural sugar substitutes and although the texture is a bit different it still tastes great
i am just starting to really experiment in the kitchen i think i have a burnt thumb lol i really wanted to try and make banana bread i was scared and prepared to fail but this recipe was so easymy boyfriend was very appreciative i used the suggestions of the extra banana and cinnamonsooooo yummy and moist and delicious will probably make again as soon as this loaf runs outhighly recommend this recipe to all beginners
solid recipe and one certainly worth keeping in your stash we live in co and i may have to tweak the recipe for our altitude but the taste is certainly there i made my loaves into muffins and added choc chips to half the muffins thanks for sharing
wow super super good banana bread all other banana bread recipes are now worthless i did what some other reviews suggested and i added an extra banana mine were on the smaller side anyway and also a tsp of cinnamon to the dry mixture i also didn39t have any buttermilk so i made my own substitution 14 cup milk with 114 tsp of lemon juice let it sit for 510 minutes next time i may add some minichocolate chips for a real dessert
threw out all the other banana bread recipes in my collection this the best one ever for variety i added mini semisweet chocolate chips to satisfy the chocoaholic in me
best ever banana bread its in the oven as we speak second time i39ve made it in 2 weeks i do add a 12 teaspoon of cinnamon and an extra banana
great and easy
wow amazing banana flavor very soft n moistcant resist eating another piece this bread is awsomedefinately a keeper used 3 bananas as suggested by other reviewersthanks to all 3 do make a big diff in tasteused a cup of brown sugarn added a few blueberries just at top which made the bread look really pretty didnt sink in the batter even baked in a foil loaf pan n a small pyrex dishused baking powder as i only had it at handbaking time was exact as recipe statesno added nuts cuz my kids r not a huge fan of nutswill definately be making it againthough will use 13cup of oil next time just to chk if it still stays moist enoughits outside was crustyn i liked it my neighbour did it tooher remarks were 34excellent34 thanks to toh thumbs up
the flavor was good but i did find it a little too moist and left me feeling like it was too oily
really good recipe didn39t have canola oil use vegetable oil and it was delicious
love this recipe make it all the time really easy and tastes amazing also if you dont have butter milk just take some regular milk and vinegar it makes the same thickness and doesnt taste any different it39s 1tbls vinegar to every cup of milk and set for 5 min while your mixing up everything else so in a 14 cup of milk i would just put 1 tsp vinegar
this stayed so moist even after it cooled for days later i followed it perfectly but left out the nuts this recipe is a keeper
made this today and it39s been a family favorite for years
huge hit with the entire family we did cut the sugar back by 14 cup and will probably reduce it more next time like others we also add ed some cinnamon and nutmeg to suit our family39s taste
thanks domsmom827 for your suggestions i used butter in place of oil and used part brown sugar part white sugar and it truly is the best ever banana bread i omitted the walnuts too my husband never liked banana bread until i made this also i always had trouble with my bread baking all the way thru wo becoming to done not anymore d
i made this yesterday and it39s very good very moist and flavorful i used 3 bananas as suggested by others and it had a nice banana flavor mine took an extra 10 minutes of baking time and thus got a little dark but that might be my old oven i think next time i will try substituting melted butter for the canola oil i prefer baking with butter
so moist and delicious
terrific i cut down to 34 cup of white sugar and 14 c brown sugar and next time will cut it even more however i also used melted butter because i did not have oil it was decadent
i choose this recipe because it only needed 2 bananas for a loaf i had 5 available and i wanted two loafs this was such delicious banana bread i didn39t have buttermilk and just used regular milk too i didn39t have canola oil so i used vegetable oil this is so moist and a lovely brown loaf when baked in metal pans i loved the chewy texture to the ends of the loaf all the kids agree and want to keep eating it even my girl that doesn39t like bananas loved it yeah i will definitely make it again
this is truly the best banana bread recipe i39ve tried and i39ve tried a few it is versatile and good just as it stands
this recipe is fantastic i39ve made it many times and wouldn39t change a thing except i usually use 3 bananas
this is the only banana bread recipe i will make from now on great
omgthis is the best banana bread ever so very flavorful and moist as suggested i used 3 bananas and did not have buttermilk so used whipped cream amp few dollops of butter i was contemplating adding the spices amp brown sugar suggested in the other reviews but do not want to alter such a perfect yummy recipe
this is my favorite banana bread recipe
great but not extraordinary
fantastic i was even able to make this in a gluten free version for my fiancé who is gluten intolerant tasted amazing
i39m not even a huge fan of banana bread but this was just delicious i left out the nuts since we didn39t have them in the house i will be saving this and using it as my standby for banana bread
i will also only be using this recipe from now on finally a banana bread that is moist and that i can taste the banana in added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg and 3 bananas hubby says instead of trying to eat the banana39s before they get overripe as usual we39ll purposefully leave them to brown just so we can have this bread as often as possible
this banana bread deserves more than 10 stars i use this recipe exclusively
this is the best banana bread i39ve ever had i made it for my family friends and church they all rave about it last week i did an experiment substituted home made cinnamon apple sauce for the bananas came out really good the people of my church really liked it i just made a loaf didn39t have any buttermilk so i melted 3 table spoons of butter added 2 table spoons of half and half the loaf came out just as good great reciepe
has anyone substituted applesauce for part of the oil i would like to cut down on calories and fat but don39t want to ruin the end result
love this recipe and have used it for years it is quite sweet and could be just as good with less sugar i cliped this recipe out of taste of home mag in 1991 issue so to deenadu maybe allrecipescom got it from taste of home don39t be too quick to judge
this is a great recipe for banana bread i love how it39s crispy on the outside and moist on the inside
this recipe has been on allrecipescom for yearsnot liking copycats
it was moist and good my family loved it we added a glaze that made it even betterglaze for one loaf 38 c sugar 14 tsp vanilla 1 tsp melted butter 18 c orange juice or lemon juice or grapefruit juice plus a little water mix poke holes and put on top of loaf
i39ve been making this same recipe since the 197039s i found it in a bon appetite magazine everyone who tries it loves it

very nicedaisyh try making mini loaves that is what i do and cut the baking time down and they did not fall and they came out perfectly i really love this recipe
really a nice recipe my family cannot have nuts so i sub in raisins instead
any suggestions would be appreciated i tried this twice today and both times it fell in the middle 10 minutes before the cook time was up the oven thermometer holds steady at 325 degrees i live at 7000 ft but other breads i have tried have done fine
truly is the best banana bread i39ve had perfect texture and flavor only change was to substitute sour cream for the buttermilk
for a delicious gooey top cover it with aluminum foil when it first comes out of the oven this is a wonderful recipe
if i could give it six stars i would this is definitely the best ever banana bread
can you believe the people who did not give 5 stars or even gave a review yet did not follow recipe directions people if you don39t follow recipe directions and change what is supposed to be done and it didn39t turn out the way it was supposed to then don39t rate low not recipe fault your fault
the name of this recipe is spot on it is the best ever banana bread and so easy too the outside has a wonderful crunch and the inside is so rich and flavorful it is the only recipe i will use from now on
i have made this recipe twice now once with nuts and once without it is by far the best banana bread i39ve ever had shhhhhdon39t tell my grandma
best banana bread i39ve every tasted definitely a keeper
this banana nut bread was the best i39ve tasted i did add 3 bananas as other recommended definitely a keeper
i39ve been using this recipe for years yes from bon appetite and it never fails to get rave reviews and requests for the recipe i do use a little less sugar 1 14 cups because i prefer it a little less sweet
this was excellent everyone loved it

this is a fantastic recipemy kids are begging me to make it again
this banana bread is just like its name best ever banana bread i have had great complements on this recipe
the title says it all it is the best ever the only thing i did different was to use raisins instead of walnuts and i made it in my breadman bread machine it has a setting for batter breads i am making it again tomorrow as soon as i buy more bananas
i loved the recipe i also changed a few things like used 34 of sugar and added mini chocolate chips and a teaspoon of nutmeg i doesn39t last long at my house
i loved this recipe with a few variations due to my families preferencesi added 1 tbsp of cinnamon 12 tsp nutmeg and a dash of clovesplus i used brown sugar in place of the sugar it stays moist and delicious to the very end but it doesn39t last long at our house
we used my motherinlaw39s wonderful recipe for 30 years but after i tried this recipe i filed my old one away my husband and all of my kids and their families say this is 34the best ever banana bread34
very good recipe would definitely make this again like other reviewers i only added 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty also used 3 bananas instead of 2 be sure to check for doneness before the amount of time called for mine only baked for 1 hour and 5 minutes ovens really vary
this is a great recipe i make it as muffins and add raisins and often call it breakfast thanks
haven39t made i yet
haven39t made i yet
haven39t made i yetbut it looks good
excellent bread i have tried many many recipes over the yearsmy family loves bananas needless to say this is truly the 34best34made it in 3 miniloaf pansof course had to adjust time due to small size of pans and added another banana it was delicious and easy
the best banana bread ever i cut the sugar down to 34 cup and add an extra banana plus chocolate chips
seriously the best banana bread i39ve ever made or had recipe asis is wonderful i39ve added 12 cup of reese39s peanut butter chips to the batter and it is absolutely crazy good i also divide mine into smaller pans and adjust cooking time and temperatures
i hadn39t thought about making banana bread before but i have a large quantity of walnuts sent to me from my grandpa who hand picked and shelled buckets of them i was excited to try this recipe based on the many awesome reviews amp boy were they spot on i did chop the nuts pretty small as i don39t really care for giant nuts in bread next time though i39ll make an exception and leave them a bit bigger by request of my dad who loves the walnuts and appreciates my grandpa39s hard work i did leave three muffins without nuts just to see the difference and enjoyed them both ways i followed a few suggestions from other bakers i only put in a cup of sugar 34 regular and 14 brown i put in three bananas and i added cinnamon a lot because it39s my favorite and i thought they came out great i made regular size muffins and would love to figure out how to make a topping for them maybe granola or something else to add a crunch or caramelized texture i39m open to suggestions
my mother made wonderful banana bread but when i tried this recipe it really was the best ever banana bread i39ve ever tasted
made this without nuts for my grandsons excellent can39t wait to make it with the walnuts this is delicious
made this banana bread tonight and it was fantastic i made on substitution out of necessity i didn39t have buttermilk so i used sour cream i have everything ready to bake another for work in the morning this will definately be my keeper for banana bread
i made this three weeks ago and added about alitle over a half cup of mini choc chips omg this is the receipe i will ever use again fast easy and delish what more could you ask for
i baked the bread at 350o f instead of 325o f i also baked the bread in two 812x41234 loaf pans and used 3 bananas instead of 2 i baked this bread for 50 to 55 minutes i was very pleased with the results as i39d stated in my previous ratingi did make recipe adaptationsi used 12 cup each chopped dried apricots and candied fruit i just used 12 cup chopped walnuts my second time around i omittedthe walnuts and added 12 cup semisweet chocolate chips 18 cup allpurpose flour so the fruit wouldn39t sink to bottom of the loaf i prepared this bread again 123113 amp i used 34 cup candied fruit amp 34 cup raisin bran crunch cereal instead of the nuts and chocolate chips this recipe is definitely a keeperthank you gert kaiser for sharing this recipe delowenstein
i did make this bread twice already and i didmake some adaptations to suit my tastesthank you for sharing this recipeit39s greatit39s also quick dawn e lowenstein
excellent and easy to make truly 34best ever34 substituted walnuts with choco chips
this is indeed a wonderful banana bread recipe my sister who hates bananas even had to admit that it was good i did however read lots of reviews before making and i used only 1 cup of sugar 12 brown amp 12 gran sugar and because i did not have buttermilk i substituted with sour cream as suggested and likewise with the walnuts i only had pecans the 1st time i tried the recipe i used an 11 cup pyrex dish as i saw that it made a really big loaf i started to moniter the baking process at approx 1 hr and tested center with a toothpick this time i doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before except i used only 3 bananas only had that many and baked in a 13 x 9 i also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting it was crispy around the edges which made it taste even better moist cake textured bread definitely a keeper
wonderful flavor i served it to my houseguests and they loved it took the recipe home with them
i made this into muffins as it is hard for the two of us to get through a whole loaf of banana bread we freeze some for later on 0 very sweet and like the idea of adding some cho chips i also freeze whole banans if i can not get to baking right away they work well after defrosting them
made these into muffins used 3 very ripe bananas and just a little more walnuts we like walnuts cut back on the sugar to 1 cup wonderful flavor and very moist my husband really likes these better then my old recipe this is a keeper will be making these again
loved it so moist and flavorfuli also used 3 bananasvery good
made two batches one with 1 cup of sugar and one with 1 12 cups both were excellentbaked for 60 min will make again
this bread was terrible was hard to get out of the pan because it slightly overflowed nothing but a gooey mess waste of ingredients
great taste texture and sooo easy to make this will become a staple at our house
made this bread exactly as it says did not change any ingredients or measurements but instead of using a 9 x 5 in loaf pan i divided the batter into 2 smaller pans as i find the middle cooks beter this bread has amazing flavor next time i will add some milk chocolate chips
the flavor is excellent but like others i must say that i coud not get the center done which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 i agree with the person who suggested baking it in two smaller loaves the crusty top is a real plus
so simple to make amp really delicious i39m already thinking of making it again
this really is the 34best ever34 banana bread i have ever made i had to substitute the buttermilk and by accident i used baking powder instead of baking soda but it still turned out wonderful can39t wait to make this again with the correct ingredients
for those who like a very sweet banana bread this is excellent the only difference between this recipe and the one i39ve been making for years is my recipe calls for 12 cup sugar amp still excellentjust less sweet
i would probably bake in two smaller pans as i thought it got a litte crusty on the outside in order to get the middle done
hey this is my recipe found it in a cooking magazine back in the 70s an absolute favorite with no substitutions
this is the recipe that i as well have been making for years i have used 3 bananas with great results i also have switched sour cream for the buttermilk great taste i did not read all the reviews but most of them one thing i didn39t see was anyone mentioning using this recipe and making mini muffins with it just make sure the nut if using as finely chopped bake for about 20 to 30 minutescheckingyum
nice texture you can substitute all purpose flour with pilsbury banana nut quick bread
made this this morning it smelled wonderful use crisco to grease bottom and half way up sides of pan once cool wrap in plastic wrap and let sit for several hours moist but not real dense i39ll make again
i added some cinnimon allspice amp nutmeg and increased the bananas to 3 excellent
best ever banana bread with a few changes 1 cup granulated sugar and 14 c brown sugar and i cup of sour cream insted buttermilk
this is the best banana bread i make it all the time minus the walnuts delicious
i had this recipe from an old friend of mine 20 years ago and have been making it since then best ever
i make this all the time i do subsitute oil for butter and i sometimes put in mini chocolate chipsyummy the best bread ever
i just happened to have some overripe bananas on my counter when this came to my inbox today lucky me i made this for my daughters and i and we were all humming 34mmmmmmm34 in unison as we sampled the still warm loaf i would certainly make this again i will also try a version as suggested by virginaca and i appreciate her input very much my hb is diabetic and her version won39t spike his sugar nearly as much as this one thank you for submitting your suggestions
this is an excellent recipe the results were great i have to agree with marian08 make the recipe as printed than rate it when changes are to suit an individual taste it is not rating the written recipe
chocolate desert and marian08many of us have allergies diabetes or other medical issues and food likes or dislikes in our families for us it39s very helpful if someone shares the way they adapted a recipe i sometimes look at a recipe that i think would be good but has ingredients i can39t use for one or more of the reasons above i don39t always feel brave enough to try and make the changes myself since i don39t always know what and how much to put in to replace thingswhen more experienced cooks try out the changes i need and share them i am in their debt there are many recipes i could never have tried without their help while you may be recipe purists please try to understand the limitations some of us live with when we are trying to expand out repertoire it39s pretty boring to eat the same things over and over because they are the only 34safe34 recipes you have
will try this recipe as is don39t know how you can rate a recipe with five stars when you change the ingredients in the recipe as for oventime we all are familiar with our own ovens and baking times
these are the changes i used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour 5 tbsp splenda baking blend and 3 tbsp splenda brown sugar blend 1 egg 2 egg whiites and 2 tbsp liquid egg substitute 6 tbsp oil and 2 tbsp butter 3 bananas added 1 tsp cinnamon and used pecans instead of walnuts my husband is allergic to them and toasted the nuts first my husband said it was the best banana bread i had ever made in 56 years of marriage i made 3 recipes and baked it in 8 mini loaf pans for 40 minutes at 325 convection healthy amp delicious
i have a little hint for this recipe this recipe is similar to mt mothers but if you mash the bskking soda in with the bananas the bananas foam and make the finish product no as dense
this is very similar to the recipe i got from my mom when i left home in 1974 as someone else stated mine calls for butter rather than oil if you don39t use 34ripe34 bananas it won39t turn out as well the riper the better absolutely the very best ever i make a dozen loaves at christmas every year and give them to friends who say they can39t wait for the holidays to roll around for another
this is 34best ever banana bread34 as others the only thing i changed was that i reduced the sugar to one cup one and one half cups was actually too sweet and less sugar is better occasionally i will substitute half the white flour for wheat and it turns out just fine
i got this recipe in your 2004 best holiday recipes magazine it is wonderful i make it exactly by your recipe with the exception of the bake time i bake it 1 hr 10 min i have taken it to church many times and i get rave reviews it39s a keeper
been using this receipe for years i agree with the others this is the best receipe i have ever used for banana bread dee nj
this is the same recipe i have used for years with one exception i use butter instead of oil i think it gives a better flavor and texture i sometimes use 12 c sour cream in place of the buttermilk because i almost always have sour cream but sometimes don39t have buttermilk both result in excellent flavor
i have been making banana bread for years but this is amazing i always freeze my old bananas so i always have bananas for bread i also sometimes throw in some blueberries or cut up apples amazing
this is the exact recip i have used for over 40 years i thought i was the only person who had this as it was given to me by a lady who passed away about 35 years agoi have always had a lot of compliments on this i have been requested to make it many times for group gatherings it makes happy to know that so many others also have the recipe i know the recipe so well that i do not even have to look at the recipe when baking it i will definitely continue to use this recipe so yes i would mmake it againthankssubmitted by kathy boltin
i am surprised to see this years ago i revised a recipe and it is identical to this one except i use 1 cup of sugar when i was working and we had pot luck lunches i was always asked to make my banana bread i have given this recipe out many times it is the best
this is the first time i have ever written a review on anything but when i saw this recipe come up for the 34taste of home recipe of the day34 i knew i had to write this this is the best banana bread recipe since i have found this one it is the only one i use and i don39t change a thing in the ingredients it has the perfect texture sweetness and its moist and when i make the two loaves this recipe makes they39re gone in two days this is the recipe i give to my daughter and anyone else looking for a delicious banana bread recipe
my wife found this recipe in toh several years ago the name is right it really is the best ever depends on your oven on how long it needs to bake
this is by far the best banana bread i have had it39s easy to make and i usually make a lot and freeze the loaves i haven39t altered the recipe but like a few of the changes that some have suggested applesauce for oil and brown sugar thanks i will try this
my tongue is still tingling from my first piece fresh out of the oven hot and yummypros moist and baked through i was really worried about putting it all in one pan because i hate partially cooked banana bread this was banana bread not pudding and i liked very much great flavor however i did cut back on the sugar only 34 cup brown and 14 cup white and substituted applesauce for oil didn39t have buttermilk onhand so i just used milk and put some butter in for flavor my dd and i are more than happy with the resultraised up to a beautiful loaf of bread i don39t know if it helped that i whisked the banana and egg mixture with an electric beater to be sure i didn39t have banana globs i will continue to do thatcons considering how sweet it is i would not follow the recipe sugar recommendationbake time for my loaf was too long and i only had it in for 50 minutes i was glad it was baked through but if this had been for gifts i would not have shared the ends will be way too tough and overdone it is very tough about a half to an inch around if i would have gone the full 1 hr 20 minutes it would have been like a gummy bearoverall love it going back for my second slice now
kids loved it the only thing i would do differently is bake it for less time we baked it 1 hour and 10 minutes and it was still a little too brown
i made this and brought it to a family reunion and my sister couldn39t stop eating ita hrefhttpyoutube downloadera
the best banana bread i have ever tasted
this banana bread is sooo good it39s so moist and it tastes wonderful i would definitely recommend anyone to make this and this will be my regular recipe for banana bread
i39m not fond of banana bread but this recipe is delicious the bread was tender neither too light nor too dense just perfect i did make a few changes 14 butter melted 14 cup vegetable oil in place of the 12 cup canola oil and used 114 cups sugar 14 cup brown sugar packed in place of 112 cups sugar the brown sugar gave it a nice darker color and a chewier crust which i like i used jumbo eggs and vanilla bean paste before i put it in the oven i sprinkled chopped walnuts and clear sugar crystals on top of the batter when it was done it looked beautiful and had a nice sweet crunch on top i will definitely be making this again would make great muffins
this recipe was great i reduced sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet enough
have been making this recipe for christmas presents for at least 7 years along with others everyone loves this also make all through the year can never make enoughi make it in mini loaves this year about 50 loaves
i39m not really a fan of banana bread but i had all the ingredients so i tried this one it39s amazing does anyone know if it freezes well i39d like to keep a few loaves on hand
it was very good just a little to sweet i even added an extra banana but the sweetness took over it i will however make again bur reduce sugar
the best banana bread recipe i39ve made it is excellent the way it is but i added another banana and it made it even more moist
5 starsi used 14 cup of melted butter and 14 cup canola oil i always use melted butter in some form in my baked goodsi also only used one cup of sugara little baker39s secret if you don39t have ripe bananas on hand use jars of banana baby food i done this many times and no one can tell the difference in fact guests always comment on how moist the bread isi always have jars on hand
love this recipe it39s the best i ever hadi39ve made it around 10 times and shared the recipe with many
it is the best used only 1 cup sugar that was enough will try the oil and apple sause suggestion next time
great banana bread moist and easy to make as suggested i reduced the sugar by 12 c and the loaf was plenty sweet enough didn39t have walnuts on hand so used pecans found it tasted even better the day after baking a keeper recipe
this is the best banana bread recipe ive tried my fiance never liked banana bread but him and my son eat it all up in a day they both always ask for it
can39t make enough of these my six grandkids love them i always make three at once
i get asked to make this all of the time i usually make muffins with it
very tasty recipe we warmed up slices and had it for breakfast very good with coffee or milk
this recipe looks awesome and judging from the reviews i think i wanna try it we usually add chocolate chips and walnuts to our batches so i hope it turns out
this is the only recipe i ever use and i dont tweek anything it is awesome everytime and freezes very well excellent for gifts and all occasions love it
i have to agree this is the best banana bread ever i add honey and maple syrup instead of sugar it is so good my husband never liked banana bread because he said it was always dry but not this one
great recipe the buttermilk is what caught my eye adds a great moistness have made it several times but make it into muffins freeze them in packs of two great to take to work for breakfast or midmorning snack hintfreeze 34too ripe34 bananas in their skins in a zipper freezer bag take out one or two for a recipe thaw for a few seconds in the microwave pinch off the stem end and squeeze the banana right out of the skin

this really is the best banana bread i39ve ever made i added a teaspoon of baking spice cinnamon cloves ginger nutmeg i won39t ever use another banana bread recipe again
the first time i made this for my mom and she loved it my brother had some and loved it too i just made some for myself and i added half a pack of banana cream pudding mix to make it even more moist and smooth i love my revised version
this is a keeper recipe all my family enjoyed it i doubled the recipe and made two loaves somehow missed the timer and thought i overbaked it but the bread was still moist and delicous
i made this recipe without the walnuts and baked it in my doughnut pani drizzled glazed on the doughnuts they were stellar
will never use another banana bread recipe again a family favorite
nice texture really moist and really tastyi used a little less sugar as well and it wasjust wonderful will make again
this is the bestever banana bread the only change i make is to subtract 1 t of buttermilk and add 1 t banana extract in its place to get a little extra banana flavor everyone loves this banana bread
the very best banana bread when i make it now i reduce the amount of sugar and instead of all white flour i substitute 1 cup white flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour and it is even better with less calories
i just found this recipe online after losing it for many years i made this in 1993 and beyond for a few years and was devastated to lose it probably in a move it was so popular i sold it at work and made muffins with it and took it to many a potluck i nearly had it memorized but couldn39t reconstruct it reading it now each ingredient comes back to me i reduced the sugar some i recall thank you for posting it
i just made this recipe again and some of it stuck to the glass pan i just read a review that said to use shortening and not the spray i will definitely do that next time the card players should love this surprise treat i would give it a 4 star rating this time
so good
reminds me of grandma39s banana nut bread very moist and flavorful and makes the whole house smell wonderful during baking freezes well also definately a keeper
i39ve made this 3 times in a weekafter reading some of the other reviews i cut oil to 14 c and used 14 applesauce i also cut sugar back to 1 cup and never missed the 12 cup of sugar today39s loaf came out delicious
i have made this bread for years i found the recipe in taste of home magazine several years ago i bring the banana bread to all family gathering the little ones just love it most are from out of state so i make extra so they can take home it is the best ever recipe for making banana bread
very very good but not the best i39ve ever made
very delicious i have already shared with two other friends
this is much easier than most banana bread recipes because no mixer is needed my husband thinks it39s the best i ever made i made 2 thinner loaves so it would bake more quickly and that worked very well
i have made many many banana bread recipes over the years i will never make another recipe again this is the winner i ran out of oil last time i made it so i put in 14 cup oil instead of the 12 and then also added 14 cup applesauceturned out perfectly highly highly recommend this recipe
this was even better than my grandmother39s recipe god rest her soul it was very moist and i love the buttermilk addition i used dried buttermilk since i didn39t have fresh i added the dried buttermilk to the dry ingredients and included the liquid in the eggs banana oil and vanilla step
this tastes good but i greased the pan and the bread would not come out of pan so i lost the entire bottom of the bread
i just discovered this recipe and agree it is the best one i have tried i added cranraisins amp shredded coconut to my batch i will try it with whole wheat amp splenda nest time
omgosh this is the best banana bread recipe ever i made it for christmas and it was a big hit my husband and son are diabetics so i used splenda instead of sugar and no one knew i will definitely make this again and again
this bread was good and moist but very sweet too much sugar in this recipe in my opinion
this recipe is wonderful i have made this bread probably 7 or 8 times in the past few months my family visiting relatives and myself included have given it rave reviews even the time i had the oven temp too low and it turned out flat as a pancake they still gobbled it all up
love this first bite i took i said 34wow this is the best banana bread i have ever eatten34 and then i looked that the recipe and laughed because that was the name
i added chocolate chips and the taste was incredible
this is a really good banana bread recipe just a couple things that you need to know the bake time at the top says 70 mins and in the recipe itself it says 1 hr 20 mins or until the tooth pick comes out clean i have made this 3 times and it takes about 60 mins at the most at 325 degrees let the bread rest in the pan for 510 mins thing remove and cool on a cooling rack the bottom tends to stick a little when using a spray so use shortening or butter to grease the pan
i made muffins they39re delish set the oven to 425 degrees and bake for 1618 minutes the minimuffins took about 67 minutes
no buttermilk in the fridge so i made my own with milk and vinegar i doubled the recipe and left out the nuts i used a couple of silicon loaf pans and the edges of the bread were a little dark i should have maybe knocked the temp down a little to compensate for the dark pan or checked it a little earlier for doneness overall though the bread turned out very nicely i have another 8 bananas on the brink so i39ll make a couple more double batches and work out my flaws i39ll go get some buttermilk too as i would like to see how that would change the flavor i imagine that this will be my goto banana bread recipe in the future thanks
i am not a chocolate chip fanso i added cinnamon chipswe are huge cinnamon fans in this house
i made this banana bread and have had numerous people ask for the recipe everyone agrees that this is the best banana bread they have ever eaten i have made several to give at christmas
very moist and tasty
this really is the best ever it lives up to its name i put some chocolate chips in it and my husband loved it i will make this over and over again
i made this for the for the first time last night it won39t be the last i used splenda baking blend for the sugar and it turned out fantastic yum
i followed this recipe to the t i39m making this for thanksgiving my husband has been bagging me to make him some banana bread i am a regular subscriber of taste of home i knew where to search for the best recipe thank u for help making my husband happy
delicious
we39ve made this several times and we love it i39ve made it with powdered buttermilk when i didn39t have actual buttermilk and didn39t want to wait until i went to the store there was very little difference
awesome i have been baking for 30 plus years and this is the best banana breadmy son stationed in japan loves to bake and i will send him this recipe
use this recipe a lot for my daughter bake sales she hadevery easy and moist breadlove it
have had this recipe from one of your magazines for a long long time it39s a family favoritedoesn39t stay around longit goes fast
this was brought to me as muffins after a motorcycle accident they are the best i add extra nuts and more bananas but they always turn out great
i have made this bread over and over again i have changed a few things to make it healthier i use whole wheat flour and only 34 c sugar i also use applesauce instead of oil and add 14 c flax seed it definately lives up to its name
this is a wonderful simple recipe however the recipe does not call for the pan to be floured as well as greased mine stuck to the bottom of the pan so in the future i will either dust the pan with flour or use parchment paper
even more delish if you add chocolate chips i39ve made this several times and everyone always raves over it
easy to make and delicious
this is the absolute very very best of all banana bread recipes it is to die for super moist and flavorful and quite addicting so happy to have found this gem of a recipe

i had 6 bananas that needed to be used so i made 3 loaves it turned out so good all three loaves look beautiful i did add 23 tsp of banana extract because i like a little more banana flavor than is usually in banana breads i39m glad i came across this recipe because it39s definatley a keeper
this really is the best ever banana bread i made this when the recipe was first published in taste of home 1992 and have made it ever since and given the recipe to many who tasted and loved it thank you for the good recipe
i make this 5 batches at a time or with a family of 6 i wouldn39t get a slice at all i make them amp give them as birthday gifts for all my friends everyone looks forward to their birthday since the know they39ll get a loaf
i make this bread anytime there are ripe bananas on hand the buttermilk makes this bread moist and flavorful
it is truly the best banan bread i have ever tasted
ethis recipeveryone loved this recipe when i made it for mothers day it really is the 34best ever banana bread 34 cathleen woodall of flordia
wow what happened to all the reviews i saw here a week or 2 ago there39s only 1 review showing here now this is the best banana bread no kidding use 3 bananas to have an overflowing cupful i used an aluminumcolored loaf pan you will love it lori in wi
this bread is absolutely delicious i agree with the title it is the best ever banana bread i leave out the nuts and add a bit more banana but other than that it39s perfect as is
i have had this recipe since the 7039s it was in the bon appetite magazine excellent banana bread
made as written it looked overcooked but tasted wonderful has a nice dark sugarery crust is that a word
probably the best banana bread recipe i have found my kids loved it and it was gone in a few hours aside from omitting the nuts i didn39t change a thing in the recipe
i made this today and its amazing it is by far the best recipe i have tried this is definitely a keep
this is hands down the best banana bread i have ever eaten or made it is my new goto recipe since last year i get many and often requests at church to bring it to any gettogether and to make it for bakesales amazing
i am always looking for a great banana bread recipe and i have found it this was delicious and very moist i used 3 bananas added chocolate chips and used milk and vinegar instead of the buttermilk will definitely be making this one again
very moist with a nice crunchy crust i used 3 bananas and added chocolate chips this was a very good combination i substituted milk and vinegar for the buttermilk
i have a 34family favorite34 banana bread recipe which is probably still the ultimate favorite however this bread is excellent as well and the reason i like it so much is that it is much lower in fat than the old family version for having only 12 cup of oil in what turns out to be a very large loaf i thought this was an exceptionally moist and flavorful bread i used 3 bananas instead of 2 since it was suggested by so many other reviewers otherwise i followed the recipe exactly skipping only the nut since my family doesn39t care for them mine actually tested done after 1 hr and 10 mins the outer crust was slightly crunchy but not hard will definitely keep this recipe and make it again
i often make this bread it is so yummy as in every bread i bake i substitute applesauce for the oil and use about 12 the sugar the last time i baked this added white chocolate chips that was really good
i made this last night and it truely is the best banana bread recipe ever i did a few things differently i added 3 bananas plus some cinammon i didn39t have any buttermilk but i did pour in some organic soy milk it was so moist on the inside and a nice texture on the outside will definitely pass around and make this again
super flavor moist and yummy
it was so good i made it twice in one night i had to share this with others so i made one for my daughters house
this is an amazing recipe probably the best banana bread i39ve had my husband who doesn39t even like banana bread very much liked this recipe the outside is crunchy right after it comes out of the oven but then it softens after it cools so i didn39t think it was too crispy at all
so after reading all of the many raves about this i thought for sure it would be better then the banana bread recipe that i already have it was not it was moist on the inside but way too hard on the outside i did use lemon juice and milk instead of buttermilk and i just used 2 bananas like the recipe called for rather then the three that many of you recommended perhaps that is why mine did not turn out so great
amazing seemed like the outside of mine was getting very dark wile the middle was still a bit to moist anyone know why that would be i followed the recipe with no changes
this banana bread is delicious i never made banana bread before but others i39ve tried have always been kind of dry this one is so moist and wonderful i used 3 bananas powdered buttermilk 12 cup each of nuts and choc chips and a touch of cinnamon so good very moist and delicious i39ll make this again for sure
these disappear at my house with 3 kids i did substitute sour cream for the buttermilk and made them as muffins cooking at 325 degrees for 2530 minutes they are a hit i hate to admit it but i even threw away the old family recipe for this one
i forgot to mention i used canola oil instead of vegetable oil
incrediblei had to make a few changes i didn39t have buttermilk and ran out of vinegar and lemon juice to make buttermilk so i used 14 cup of 1 milk and added 1 tbsp of orange juice to it i also used 3 large bananas so important that they are partially green not completely ripe and i also added 14 cup of ground flax seed as well i also reduced the sugar from 1 12 cups to just 1 cup although you could still reduce it more i added a dash of nutmeg a dash of ground cloves and about 12 tsp of cinnamon i really enjoyed reading everyone39s reviews and suggestions too it helped me with making my own changes thanks for a great starting point with this recipe it39s a keeper
love it love it love it i did the recommended 3 bananas a true keeper
i love to bake but i had never made banana bread until thanksgiving of 2010 it turned out awful it wasn39t sweet enough or have enough banana flavor to suit me i didn39t give up i saw this recipe on your website and tried it it is magnificent my family loved it so much they wanted loafs for their christmas gifts i pretty much have to make it about every week now my coworkers love it my friends at church love it it is truly the best ever banana bread and easy to make thanks for publishing this recipe kristine from anthony kansas

i make this without buttermilk i add 4 bananas instead of three
really truly deliciousi wanted to make banana bread for my house full of people at christmas time but i had misplaced my grandmother39s tried and true recipe when we moved last summer so i came to tasteofhomecom for a banana bread recipe to follow in a pinch it was a hiti especially love the fact that this recipe is made with vegetable oil rather than shortening like grandma39s recipe was so i was able to avoid using the hydrogenated oils found in shortening and i didn39t have buttermilk on hand so i substituted an equal amount of milk with 1 t white vinegar added and it still came out perfectbest banana bread i39ve ever made
i tried this recipe over the christmas holiday as a brunch item for my guests the bread disappeared quickly they requested it as a must have for next year
sweet amp moist
amazing i want to try it with applesauce instead of oil next time very good so glad i found this
i love this bread and so dose everyone i make it for the only thing i never have butter milk so i do the lemon juice trick or use sourcream butit is wounderful
wonderful bread i added an extra half cup or so of banana because i used three very ripe bananas it was exceptionally moist
amazing with chocolate chips
i39ve been baking this banana bread or as muffins since it appeared in country october 1991 it is very moist and always delicious changes i39ve made over the years use 1 c white flour with 34 c whole wheat flour use buttermilk powder with water use 34 c grapenuts cereal instead of walnuts gives it a bit of a crunch and some texture while being nut allergyfree
made this in a bundt pan and other then not baking for as long as in a bread pan it came out very good easy and yummy
this is the best banana bread recipe ever very moist and great banana flavor

made a lot of banana bread in my time and this is definitely my favorite and my family39s favorite recipe my family could not get enough of it so i will be making more again today
we really like this bread i didn39t have walnuts the last time so i used pecans instead yum
i substituted applesauce for the oil in a small attempt to make this recipe healthier but i think it made it chewy i also didn39t have any buttermilk so i had to find a substitute for that as well it39s a good recipe and next time i39ll make it with all the ingredients and no subs
wonderful i have several banana bread receipe39s but this one is the best and i will throw the other ones away the first one i made was sooo good that i made it again the next day as it was all gone in a minute it is soooo moist and tastey and everyone raved about it i will tell everyone about it and share my receipe with them i can give it a 10 star thanks for sharing it with us
amazing i made one loaf for my dad and then the rest of the family wanted more so i ended up making 5 all together these are incredible
i thought i had the best banana bread recipe until i made this one it39s great but i will use a little less sugar next time too sweet for my taste
this was very good i will definitely be making it again
i made three loaves at one time and in two days they were all gone my family loves it and a neighbor asked for the recipe i am waiting and watching for bananas to over ripen
this was a great recipe it was moist and very good since we didn39t have buttermilk we just made buttermilk by putting a teaspoon if vinegar every cup of milk turned out great
this absolutely a keeper i have made this several times
omg yes this recipe is delicious u can tell look at the reviews i made it and the whole pan was gone the same day between my husband and 14yr old son i39m baking another as we speak i used 3 very ripe bananas it is delicious
i had my reservations since once burned with a recipe stated as being 34the best34 and was not but i tried it anyways and i39m so glad i did i39m not a fantastic lover of banana bread but this one proved to be the exception it truly is the best one that i39ve ever tasted and 34hubby34 said the same with rating it to be a 341034 in goodness i exchanged white sugar for raw organic cane sugar and used 14 cup less sugar i also used organic bananas that were very ripe and organic eggs this one definately go in my best foot recipe category yum
just finished baking this for the very first time i was so intrigued to bake it since it has so many great reviews it came out great much better than other banana bread recipes i have tried my picky 3yearold daughter even loved it it39s definitely a keeper thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe
i think this is the exact recipe i have made for 15 years i did change it though i use 4 overripe bananas and no buttermilk and add a bag of chocolate chips
excellent i doubled the recipe and made two loaves so i could give away one the name of the recipe is true very moist very good

i baked this bread for a friend and she absolutely loved it i have not had the opportunity to bake me a loaf but i will be sure to do so after the reviews it received from her smelled like an amazing bread
shared this recipe with my momshe agrees that it beat grandma39s amp is our new 34family34 recipe if grandma were around she wouldn39t mind since we discovered most of her 34secret recipes34 came from taste of home
i have tried many and this is my favourite by far it did take about 20 min longer in the oven and i used pecans
wonderfully moist and tasty i also substituted the oil with applesauce and added chocolate chips loved it will definitely make again
this is the 34best ever banana bread34 i have tried many many recipies and this one is tops i receive many compliments and someone always wants the recipe
i39ve discovered making one loaf of this wonderful bread is never enough soooo i double recipe which yields three 8x4x2 inch loaves
this is a delicious recipe i will definitely be making this again the only substitute i made was replacing the walnuts for pecans the result was successful and delicious thank you for sharing
i have been making this banana bread since i first saw the recipe in 1992 and it is the best evermarilyn
pi made this bread for thanksgiving dinner everyone loved it the only left overs taken home by my guest was the bread 1 review stated that the bread stuck so i placed wax paper into the bottom of the pan i did have 1 end that stuck but i think this was my fault because i left the nuts in half sizes which stuck to the side of the pan and pulled the bread apart when i tried to remove it i will be cooking several loafs at christmas to give away and i will use wax paper for the bottom and sidesp
i substitute butter for the oil this has been a favorite for many years
this is truly the best ever banana bread very crunchy crustlori
wonderful recipe best banana bread i39ve ever hadeven better than my grandmother39s easy to make as well i definitely recommend this recipe pam
made this for the first time and it is delicious new banana bread recipe for me
best ever banana bread is a favorite at our house i always double the recipe since it goes so fast i get 3 loaves from a double batch by baking them in 8 x 4 x 25 inch glass loaf pans oven temperatures may vary so check them after an hour generally mine take 114 hoursit39s hard to resist having a slice fresh from the oven yum
i39ve made this banana bread recipe so many times now that i have it memorized it lives up to its name and really is the best ever banana bread i have tasted all of my family agree
this soup didn39t remind me of a cheeseburger in any way shape or form the potatoes just didn39t seem to belong i did like the cheesy broth and if i make it again will leave out the potatoes and add either broccoli with bacon or macaroni
was just ok for us we felt like it was missing flavor just needed something probably make again
i love this soup and have made it multiple times already and so easy to make
this recipe was highlighted in a recent taste of home email and i had to try it it was excellent the recipe was a bit high in sodium so i chose to use unsalted butter i added mushrooms as my preferred cheeseburger is a mushroom cheeseburger and a bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick a shoutout to the wife of james569 with the suggestion of a adding a bit of mustard to the bowl just a skosh and to cincibetty for suggesting doubling the hamburger this recipe is destined for my next potluck
pi downloaded this recipe after recently receiving it in an email from taste of home i made it today and just love it my wife decided to add just a little yellow mustard to her bowl omg that39s a much better cheeseburger flavorppgreat recipeppjames nmp
pthis is the best soup recipe ever except i double the hamburger a friend a vegetarian leaves the hamburger out and she loves it that wayp
i39ve make this soup countless of time food day at work this soup is always requested i follow the recipe as written with the exception of adding what ever left over cheeses i have in the refrigerator along with the velveeta i am making this soup this week instead of buying the 5 of potatoes i39m going to try using the cubed hash brown potatoes from the freezer section at the grocery store
this soup was excellent it was my first time making a homemade soup and it made me a star with my husband and our son they loved it and so did i wonderful flavor
i love this recipe but won39t try dont like the time it tales to cook im disabled and limited to standing time
so good i saved myself a pan though in the directions after i transferred the cooked ground beef i used a full pound and it was perfect to a plate i melted all of the butter called for in the same pan sauteed the onions carrots and celery and then sprinkled the flour over top after the veggies had softened i mixed in the diced raw potatoes and the cooked ground beef and then poured in the chicken broth it smelled so good while it was cooking once the potatoes were cooked through i added in the milk and i used shredded sharp cheddar instead of velveeta it is what i had on hand i also left out the basil and the sour cream and i am glad i did my whole family loved this and i will definitely be making it again it came together so fast a very hearty soup and so easy to make even without my changes this would39ve been delicious but i love how easy it is to alter it to your own tastes you can39t go wrong with this recipe
the change i made was omitting celery and adding fresh red pepper in its place we loved this
after seeing this recipe for years i finally got around to making it yesterday and i39m sorry to say i39m kicking myself for not trying it much sooner i didn39t have whole milk so i used 1 can of evaporated milk and it was awesome best soup ever
my kids absolutely love this recipe
i have made this delicious soup several times always very tasty my husband loves it and ànyone who tastes it wants recipe i think next i make i will add bacon crumbled i made exactly what the recipe called for but forgot to add the sour cream this time but still good thank you very much for sharing recipe
loved this i used mushroom broth and cheddar for my soup still turned out amazing and the hublet devoured it
very good to save using an extra pan i did not divide the butter i melted all of the butter to cook the vegetables in then stirred in the flour to cook it i then proceeded with the recipe as written
my two kids can be fairly picky eaters they have recently decided they like cheeseburgers i saw this soup recipe and thought 34why not let39s give this a try34 miracle of all miracles they both liked the soup instead of garnishing with sour cream we used a few spoonfuls of pickle relish because whenever my daughter orders a cheeseburger in a restaurant she orders it with 34pickles extra pickles and more extra pickles34
recipe is good but the directions suck they lump three or four different steps into one step so you39re constantly back and forth between ingredients and directions trying to remember where you39re at
made this for our football sunday in snowy upstate new york doubled it as i have 4 grown men with some texas toast they all loved it guaranteed it will be done by the time the day is over thank you for a great recipe
i do a full lb of ground beef but this is fantastic nice spin on potato soup with the change of the regular protein
okay but probably make again
i made this last night and it was very good definitely making it again i didn39t use shredded velveeta but had shredded cheddar cheese didn39t whole milk but used 2 and added a tsp or so of dill pickle relish to our servings and it made a huge difference in tasting more like a cheeseburger
comfort food supreme no changes needed except salt and pepper preference nice creamy rich soup
this is one of my favorite recipes made it several times as is with one added step the addendum is i use an immersion blender to make the soup creamy my one complaint is the recipe reads makes 8 servings 2 quarts this recipe fills my 6 quart dutch oven plenty of leftovers
made this for our neighbor that is stationed here his wife would make this soup for him and since he was far from home i made it for him he loved it and so did the rest of our neighbors thank you
this was a very good soup it was thick and cheesy with lots of veggies pretty much everything i could ask from a soup i can see ways to adjust it for personal tastes with no problems the only thing i didn39t like was making the roux separately but i will figure a way around that
good recipe easy quick i added smoked paprika green peppers garlic thyme used velveeta sharp cheddar and cream cheese i didn39t make a roux as i didn39t want it to thick added some cornstarch and it was perfect topped w bacon i will definitely make this again
delish will keep it for a regular soup
i see some reviews by the inevitable health nags well all i can say is look at the number of reviews this recipe has you39re outvoted lol made this and it was loved by youngsters and oldsters alike
this looks delicious if i want to make it in the slow cooker are there anything different to do and also how long would it take to cook in the slow cooker
this is delicious i usually make it a few times a month in the fall and winter as it is one of the few meals that everyone in my family will eat adapted it a little to suit my tastes i use a combination of sharp and mild cheddars instead of velveeta and i use a combination of peeled russet all purpose potatoes and unpeeled yukon gold potatoes as i like the different textures sour cream is not something that i keep on hand so i rarely add it in we drink fat free milk so i often use that instead of buying whole milk just for using in this recipe to change things up from time to time in place of ground beef used both ground and link sausages sliced thin and cubed ham also left the meat out altogether and doubled the potatoes when using ground meat i typically use a whole pound instead of a half pound any way i make it we like to sprinkle some bacon on top enjoy
this was excellent the only adjustments i made were to use cheddar instead of velveeta and because my granddaughter just had braces put on i blended it with an immersion blender before adding the milk and cheese it isn39t exactly pretty but the flavor is phenomenal
this is a delicious hearty soup i could hear my husband telling my granddaughter that it smelled so good as i was cooking it he was so primed to eat this when my son got home my husband asked him if he was hungry or starving one whiff of this soup and my son said 34starving34 out of this big pot of soup all that is left is barely enough for one serving tomorrow highly recommend this ty joanie shawhan for sharing this ty toh for posting this once more toh delivers
could cauliflower be substituted for potatoes to make more keto friendly
delicious i added more beef veggies and less potato very good
it39s delicious but as written this is more like a cheesy potato soup that happens to have a liiiiiittle bit of beef in it too little for me to call it a cheeseburger soup next time i39ll use a full pound of beef and maybe cut back on the potatoes some
very good i39d seen the recipe many times but always thought it sounded gross judging by the name after actually reading it i decided to give it a try so glad i did i added 32oz of chicken broth we like our soup more brothy i used 1lb of velveeta about 2 cups grated it was plenty of cheese i think more would have been too much i also threw in a couple diced jalepenos i39ll add a couple more next time my only complaint is the name of the recipe
outstanding soup really good made 2321 with following modifications used combination of no sodiumlow sodium chicken broth and 93 lean ground beef and extra sharp cheddar cheese also sauteed diced potatoes in separate pan before adding to soup the consistency of this soup is perfect somewhat thick and taste is superb if you haven39t tried it i highly recommend
this is my family39s all time favorite soup recipe and they request it multiple times each winter i use leftover meatloaf to make it instead of ground beef
i made half recipe for lunch today for 2 and all is gone i forgot the sour cream and used fresh parsley and used the lesser amount of velveeta my nonsoup loving husband liked this soup i can see why it appeals to most people but i like spicier soups i also think the soup is thick enough with the potatoes that the flour slurry is not needed a sharp cheddar in lieu of the velveeta might be an improvement
just once i39d like to see one of these recipes serve fewer than an army maybe have one that serves two or three once and awhile
totally delicious this is our 34go to34 soup any time of year i39ve shared this recipe with many family members i do no change any of the ingredients obviously a family favorite
delicious and perfect for a cold winter afternoon i heeded the commentsused 2x more beef half as much potatoes and shredded cheddar instead of velveeta hubby bragged at work and i shared the recipe definitely making again
i made this recipe today and i would have to say nothing great i did not add the potatoes and celery as these are not things i would typically expect in a however i did add the carrots as it is nice to have some veggies in there i also added macaroni so it just liquid cheese i was eating i guess i just hate american cheese very fake tasting and leaves a sticky coating in your mouth i am going to try this recipe again with real cheddar and hopefully it comes out tastier
at a loss how this recipe became a contest winnerhad better in a hobo camp
it took a while for me to get my husband to even try a spoon of this soup he loved it it is his most requested soup easy to make and easy too change up if desired definitely a keeper
i totally forgot the sour cream but did add 2 tsp worchestershire sauce that really enhanced the flavor i also added some shredded cheese as the velveeta is a little bland for this wisconsinite i did use fewer potatoes as one reviewer noted and a little less broth as we line thicker soups
i recall making this soup back when i was first getting the taste of home annual recipe books however i39d used sliced carrots potato chunks cheddar cheese milk and instead of sour cream i39d used ranch dressing i used 1 lb of ground beef i39d checked my logbooks of reviews and i don39t recall rating this recipe 12132020
one of the absolute best soups i have made yet and i make soup every sunday no doubt this will be gone in the next few days i added 5 cups of chicken broth instead 2 cups of milk and i doubled the ground beef as others suggested turned out fantastic
made this recipe for my mom and i on this cold december 5th night and i can now add this soup recipe to my top 5 favorite soups 1010
loved this recipe huge hit i mixed up the cheeses and it was amazing will make again absolutely love this soup so easy and fillling
just made this for the first time and my family loved it i omitted the carrots and added some jalapeno39s to give it a little kick i also used frozen potatoes which saved time doubled the batch and it39s going fast
honestlythis was truly the grossest soup ever made and i was so excited
we really liked this soup especially on a cold fall day next time i will double the beef and half the potatoes
first time making this i used a can of cheddar cheese soup and 2 milk and just used a dollop of sour cream in the bowl if anyone wanted it it take long to make was easy and we loved it
this was a hit in our house i followed the recipe exactly but next time i would double the amount of meat and half the amount of potatoes but even as is everyone enjoyed it and the leftovers got eaten the next day for lunch
made this twice now used one pound of ground beef 2 milk and shredded sharp cheddar cheese the second time and i think this made the flavor better
this is like the best soup my family will request it every time they get one year my son was having a pot luck day at school and insisted that he bring this soup it was a big hit i have added bacon for a change and added pepper jack cheese
why do people rate something one star be ause they don39t like the ingredients
everyone in my family raves about this recipe even when i double the recipe i rarely have many leftovers
absolutely delicious i did tweak it a bit by adding 2 tsp ground mustard and 14 tsp cayenne and since we don39t eat velveeta i substituted sharp cheddar i will definitely make it again thanks
first time i made this i found the velveeta made it a little thicker than i was expecting so i made two adjustments kicking the beef up to a full pound and using 8 ounces of apple wood smoked gruyere cheese instead of the velveeta the end result was a submission to the food service at work39s annual soup and chili contest with a first place win in the soup category and a rotating place on their menu for the past winter season it was so popular that it has become a fixture on the menu every third friday and almost a year later still always sells out
yum mmm good i have been making this for about 8 years and it is always a winner when i make this my friend you eat cheese looks forward to when i make it have never had anyone turn this away it is a very hearty soup and fills you up if you have any left it freezes well
we love cheeseburger soup the potatoes and cheese make this very good
definitely not a keeper for our house made exactly according to directions and our 2 year old pushed her bowl away saying thank you the teenager tried two bites and decided on a sandwich and the two adults ate it but said never again will stick to a traditional potato soup
we have been offering this for many years in our school concession stand i think if we stopped be a riot the commenters on this site have become more vicious over the years if you like a recipe then give it one star and move on
i don39t mean any insult but hamburgers do not have potatoes in them there is a much better recipe on food network from diners driveins and dives sorry
for anyone who thinks this recipe looks good don39t be deceived for me it looks like vomit and it tastes the same even substituting real cheese for that velveeta plastic cheese i39m sorry if i sound like a snob but velveeta is for those who have no idea what real cheese
we love this my husband asks for this over and over so i usually make a double batch and we freeze containers for later
this is a keeper everyone in my family loved this soup even my hesitant husband i doubled the recipe and it turned out amazing shared it with friends and family and they also agree that it39s a keeper
i made this recipe for my husband and while already delicious he had the genius idea of adding diced pickles to the soup oh boy that took the soup to the next level the pickles made the soup taste like a cheeseburger in a bowl so good
this soup is fantastic i increased the sour cream to12 cup and used the max amount velveeta suggested omg it was good
a family favorite around here we substitute real cheese for velveeta and that just increases the flavor
gads how good is this forgot the sour creme still awesomeness i added some roasted garlic powder and bacon for topping house smells amazing and the taste is incredible thank you
i made this hamburger soup and it was the best soup i have ever and i do mean 34ever34 tasted forget the leftovers there won39t be any unless you double it and freeze some for later
this is hands down our favorite soup we have been making this recipe for a few years now but we make it a tad bit different we use sausage instead of ground beef and the flavor is absolutely amazing we do everything else the same except using the entire block of velveeta we eat it with french bread and it39s the best
i39ve made this soup twice in the past 10 days my family loves it i added more meat for our liking i used about 125 lbs of very lean ground beef i increased the broth to 4 cups the milk to 2 cups and used half a large i think a 2 lb brick container of velveeta hubby suggested adding some bacon which sounds fabulous
excited to make this is there an alternative to velveeta
i made this soup for dinner tonight and am very pleased at how it turned out i followed the recipe ingredients exactly except i thicken the soup with the flour mixture i use it because then my gluten free son in law can also eat it it was still a very nice consistency i also used half velveeta cheese and half cooper sharp just because i already had some to use up i also doubled the meat it is delicious
this recipe is popular for very valid reasons i doubled it and fed my family of 5 ages 55 to 12 some of them very picky eaters and everyone loved it even the leftovers were consumed it is simple to make the ingredients are readily available i have to admit it isn39t the healthiest dish i make but every once in awhile for us consuming things like this in moderation is the key for my family this fits the comfort food category
i enjoy learning from other people who really can cook unlike me just following recipes i have learned a lot from people who find a recipe and alter it before even trying it i have tried to do that here i substituted chicken for the beef margarine for the butter used a nosalt version of chicken broth cornstarch for the flour tofu for the velveeta skim milk instead of whole did not add any salt and used cultured buttermilk instead of sour cream my family has decided that i can have it all to myself it39s their loss thank you for this recipe
i made this tonight i did change it up a little bit though i omitted the carrots and the roux used to thicken the soup when a soup has lots of cheese like this one does a roux to thicken things isnt really necessary in my opinion i added a little bit of dill weed as well which gave it a little kick my boyfriend had picked out a hickory smoked bourbon gouda that he decided he wasnt a fan of after i already sliced some for his lunch so i threw that in there too we39re definitely going to be making it again
really enjoyed making this i followed the recipe exactly as is and we are very happy with how well it turned out we will be making this again thank you for sharing your recipe
i39ve made this twice now the first time according to recipe but used real wi cheese don39t do celery because my daughter doesn39t like it the second time i added more hamburger a bit of minced garlic and a lot more grated sharp cheddar we love it
i have made a version of this for years it is a family favorite and i have served it to company and the also loved it it39s a fast and easy recipe to make and i always make eougj for leftovers
love it pretty much followed the directions except i used the white queso velveeta instead of the regular my husband went back for 3rds my daughter who hates cheeseburgers loved it and said that she wants it again and again i39m from wisconsin as well so this super cheesy soup is right up my ally thanks so much for sharing it with us shawhan
this soup was so easy to make and i had most of the ingredients on hand i changed a few things only because of what i had on hand i used 1 pound of ground beef instead of a half pound i used 3 cups of potatoes instead of 4 cups and i used beef broth instead of chicken broth i made bread bowls to serve the soup in my husband sister and 5 year old niece loved this soup
i absolutely loved this soup so easy to make and it contains ingredients i typically have on hand i did use a full pound of ground beef but didn39t change anything else delicious
i am not a big soup fan but i love love love this soup it takes a little time to prepare but it is so very worth every minute
i made this last night it was so delicious that i had the leftover for brunch the only thing i did differently was add a can of drained green beans to it because i didn39t have any celery can39t wait to make it again
this fantastic soup is a favorite of my whole family and anyone serve it to a little labor intense but soo worth it
my husband loved it i think it could use an extra half pound of beef the only thing i changed was adding paprika to the finished product a bread bowl wouldve been nice to as it is very cheesey get the good cheese
amer maybe a more polite approach would have been better to let other39s know you didn39t care for this soup joanie thank you for sharing your recipe i wanted something quick easy a soup and something that would use the 1lb of ground beef i had thawing in the refrigerator for dinner my husband is on a low fodmap diet per his gi dr so i omitted the onion as that39s high in fodmaps and i added half the velvetta cheese and substituted the rest with cheddar cheese i also used beef stock vs chicken stock to amp up the beefiness my husband loved it
my family absolutely loves this recipe
incredible soup i cannot believe how good this is i used leftover taco meat and something about those taco spices in the soup put this over the top
we love it thank you i did make some adjustments i only had shredded mexican cheese on hand and beef broth so i used those instead of chicken broth and velveeta i also didn39t add sour cream my 4 kids from 13yrs4yrs all loved it we will make it again thank you
family favorite i use a whole pound of ground beef
the best soup ever
love made a version for a soup contest and got 2nd i would recommend sticking with the lower amount of valveeta adding a cup of pepper jack cheese and adding nearly a cup of chicken broth
i was really excited to make this soup after reading all the great reviews i have to agree with the one review i read that said it was basically hamburger helper without noodles actually i think hamburger helper tastes better then this the only change i made was to add a some bacon at the end my husband and i did not care for this at all
this soup is awesome i made a few changes because my husband likes a heartier soup i doubled the burger added bacon and used beef broth instead of chicken broth it came out amazing this is a keeper
made this recipe pretty much as written except for no sour cream because i forgot to pick some up even though i am not usually a fan of velveeta it was hearty and had a good rich flavor that both my husband and i enjoyed definitely a keeper
my family couldn39t stop raving about this soup i didn39t have celery so i left it out we will definitely make it again
loved this soup the only thing different was i used chedder cheese and substituted noodles for the potatoes
this cheeseburger soup is absolutely amazing i first made this when my husband was doing chemo and radition treatments only thing he could eat even after his surgery he cant eat very well but this soup does the trick i make it quite often and it jusy keeps getting better
this is a family favourite
i love this soup it39s so cheesy and satisfying
loved it but used cheddar instead of velveeta
i love this soup its one of my favourites i substitute ground chicken or turkey for the ground beef and i add garlic i have used different types of cheese but the velvetta works well these are just my own personal preferences turns out great every time no matter what type of cheese i use
made this for our soup supper at church and everyone loved it
made this in the crockpot and it turned out delicious instead of velveeta cheese i just used what i had in the fridge half a block of habanero cheese and about 13 a small jar of cheese wiz left out the sour cream
love this soup use tater tots bake nice and crispy and then cut them up and add to soup also add 1 tbsp of ketchup yellow mustard and dill relish i use sharp cheddar and american to the soup instead of velvetta everyone i give it to raves about this soup secert a half tsp of worchershire sauce
delicious love it can it be frozen i didn39t think so
14 cup sour cream
i was wondering if this soup can go in a crockpot
can anyone tell me how much sour cream i39ve looked and can39t find it in the list i guess my seeing eye dog needs a seeing eye dog
it tastes amazing and i have made it for family dinner for about three times and my family has loved it every time
my husband gave this 5 stars i made a double recipe and i changed it a bit it went against my cooking history to leave the ground beef with no seasoning so i added a little garlic powder when frying and then a little salt after frying then i used cheddar cheese instead of velveeta cheese next time i will use a cup or two more cheese i will definitely be making this in the future
this recipe is re kick starting my luv for soupsbased upon what i just read my mouth is really watering for this one
really enjoyed this changed the cheese to cheddar and used 1 milk hubby really liked this will be definitely be making again
wow i can see how this recipe got so many good reviews my neighbor made this soup and shared it with me she followed the directions exactly and i39m glad she did i found this soup to me rich and flavorful with a nice consistency and adding the sour cream at the end gives it a smooth and creamy texture when i make this soup i just might add some cooked and crumbled bacon other than that it39s perfect
made as directed it was good but not exceptional i thought with all the 5 star reviews it would be better hubby loved it
this is the highest rated recipe on the whole site hamburger and potatoes swimming in processed cheese and loaded with calories carbs fat and sodium this looks like hamburger helper only someone forgot the pasta and threw in potato chunks ground beef swimming in melted processed cheese is the best of the best i39m surprised the instructions didn39t suggest dipping some mayonnaise on white bread sandwiches in it to complete the theme
not sure why i waited so long to make thisit is so delicious i followed the recipe as directed but used a whole pound of ground beef a whole diced onion and a little less than half of a large brick 2lb size of velveeta i also shred the velveeta but cubed it and it melted just fine added bacon crumbles for even more flavor will be adding this to my winter comfort food rotationsooooo good
this soup was a big hit in our house i had 1 lb of ground beef so i doubled the recipe i only had 116oz velveeta cheese and approx 6 slices of kraft cheese slices so i used that and thought that if i would have doubled the cheese it may have been too cheesy for our liking however we did garnish our bowls with grated cheddar cheese i can39t believe this is the first time in my life that i39ve hat cheeseburger soup thanks taste of home
i made this asis with the exception of cutting the carrots in to chunks and adding a couple of cups of colby jack cheese along with the velveeta along with some nice dinner rolls this was delicious this time i used the measurements listed next time going to double it so i can throw some in the freezer
i have read a few things on how to shred a soft cheese like velveeta can anyone here tell me what works best for them also to edward maybe they have since fixed it but sour cream is a listed ingredient
i use some petite diced tomatoes too as for velveeta subs no not a good idea but i do add some grated sharp cheddar in addition to but stir in at the end i skipped the dried herbs as well
made this today for the first time went a more keto friendly route and used turnips instead of potatoes came out amazing i saw several comments asking if anyone has tried using a different cheese i switched velveta for 1 cup sharp cheddar 1 cup smoked cheddar 1 cup smoked gouda and 1 cup gruyere i know how the velveta version tastes but this came out amazing
i love this recipe the flavor is delicious to madelyn below who wondered if anyone has used another cheese other than velveeta i did i cubed up cheddar cheese i did not like it as well i didn39t like the texture and the flavor was a little different i am sticking with velveeta
well it was 50c here in canada and today felt like a soup day so i chose this recipe i39ve made this recipe a few times it is a family favorite and the kids love it this is the first time i39ve garnished it with pickle slices it39s even better with the pickles we love this soup thanks for the recipe
i made this a couple of weeks ago minus the celery and it was wonderful even the husband liked it thanks for sharing this great recipe
i made this for dinner it was wonderful and tastes just like a cheeseburger
found the link to this in a taste of home email i have been making this recipe for many years exactly as written and wouldn39t change a thing i got this recipe out of a taste of home magazine before taste of home had a website it is an absolute favorite of my families if i even make it to having leftovers everyone fights over who gets to have it in their lunch box the next day one person asked if anyone has used anything other than velveeta if you mean name brand vs non name brand then yes i have i have found that velveeta has a much better flavor in the soup then the off brands that i have used
hey edward go get your seeingeye dog and have him read the recipe for you sour cream is the last ingredient listed this is a great recipe soup is wonderful
this is very good i cut up
has anyone used something other than velveeta
it seems that recipes on the internet are getting sloppy why would you mention at the end to add the sour cream and yet it was never mentioned as an ingredient
flexible i skipped the carrots and celery cause not a fan of those flavours and opted for mushrooms and broccoli instead i used duck fat in lieu of butter and duck stock in lieu of chicken because what i have i used whatever cheese was in my fridge left over taco mix and cheddar it was still delicious i love a recipe easy to adapt thank you
i love this soup i like to add some chopped up dill pickle spears really makes it taste like a cheeseburger
this soup is amazing we have leftovers in the frig right now you can double easily for a crowd i threw in a couple of handfuls of elbow macaroni also i got it from my daughter39s friend jill i sometimes premake the first part waiting on adding the potatoes until serving day most of the prep work is done that way and you bring up to a boil throw in potatoes finish with the cheese milk etc excellent
i made this for a girlscousins get together yesterday there was also chili some spicy chicken taco soup and some corn chowderthis was the biggest hit
we39ve loved this soup my husband who is not a soup fan raves over this recipe and he and our 12 year old will play fight for the leftovers this makes a very generous helping oh it39s even better the next couple days as leftovers warms up great
this is a great base for any type of cheese soup i didn39t have all of the vegetable ingredients to add but i did have a bag of frozen broccoli so i decided to mit the veggies in the recipe and instead make a broccoli and cheese hamburger soup it really was delicious and made plenty for everyone
always enough to share with somone else
my family absolutely loves this soup perfect for cold winter days it39s very hearty and filling
the broth was excellent but it seemed more like a cheesy potato soup than cheeseburger enjoy this soup anyway and make this again but next time double the meat and cut back on the potatoes to make it more
great recipe the ingredients in this soup work together perfectly the carrots onions and celery are what give the soup a great flavor but still i made a couple of my own changes i39m not a velveeta fan so i used even amounts of cheddar and american cheese any combination of cheeses you like would work i used a pound of ground beef and as someone suggested i added just a splash of worcestershire sauce this delicious recipe is a keeper
the best recipe for this soup love it
i found this to be a bit on the heavy side for a soup it had more of a stew look but it was very tasty and made for a filling soup
try thickening soup with mashed potato flakes instead if flour thats how i thicken my potato soup and cream of broccoli soup and this one i always keep an extra pouch or box of mashed potatoes for this then there is no flour taste
this has become my families favorite soup i did switch up the cheese mix a little i used some gruyere and aged gouda along with chedder and some shredded american cheese it melts so well i39ve made it three times and i have never had leftovers
made this for the first time last week and it was absolutely delicious i doubled the recipe and it was gone in no time i can39t wait to take it to our next 34soup supper34 at my church i will make sure to have copies of the recipe with me as i am sure that there will be many requests for it
great recipe but i think the skewers are a miss i get the pickle and onion connection but not this way
i added a little relishmade it even more like a cheeseburger
i have been making this very versatile recipe for a couple decades my favorite version is replacing the potatoes with cauliflower pulled apart in similar size pieces with the stems cut up also i chop up fresh parsley14 to 12 cup real cheddar instead of velveeta replace burger with cubed ham but just as good without meat at all
so full of flavor i double the amount of cheese onions and hamburger
adding the given 34 t of salt is crazy in just the velveeta amp 3 cups of the lowest sodium chicken broth there is at least 7500 mg of sodium smh
absolutely delicious perfect snow day recipe
this is one of our favorite soups so delicious and if there are any leftovers they are just as good if not better than the first time around
this soup is one of our favorites i make it often in the winter if there are any leftovers which is rare i put it in individual servings in the freezer for a quick lunch the only change i make is that i add a full pound of hamburger the carrots onions and celery give the soup a great flavor i thought the basil was different but it is excellent in the soup the amount of cheese is just right as it is not overly cheesy i will definitely keep making this soup
this was a terrific dish my entire family loved it i used full pound of hamburger instead of 12 pound
i loved it only used half the cheese and 2 milk
i have been making this soup since it was first published in 1996 the only changes i make are to use a full pound of ground beef and american cheese rather than velveeta i also sometimes add more chicken broth to thin it out a bit definite winner for my husband
i used a full pound of ground beef and no velvettacheddar cheese and 14 c cream cheese instead it seemed to lack flavor until i added a pinch of red pepper flakes some worcestershire sauce and a good teaspoon of bacon grease i know i knowbut it needed something after those were added it tasted great the next time i39ll saute the vegetables in a bit of bacon grease andor crumble some cooked bacon on the top who doesn39t love a bacon cheeseburger
excellent both my guys hubby and dad liked it i used almond milk and added a bit of shedded cheddar as i was a bit short on velveetawill definitely make again
the soup went over well with the family the only changes i would make would be to use the full pound of hamburger and change the ratio of butter to flour to make the roux the recipe39s directions made a thick dry paste i could actually taste the flour in the soup so when i make this again i will use 4 tbsp of butter to 14 cup flour i may need to tweek it a little so the roux is pourable instead of a lumpy paste
a staple in our home freezes well and everyone loves it
this was okay it is very heavy and i won39t make it again it tastes like a bowl of queso
i used this recipe as a guide i had to remove the carrots as some of family do not like cooked carrots so i added corn instead i also added a tsp of worcestershire sauce and 18 cup of red wine the alcohol cooks out leaving more of a rich flavor to the meat
my family loved this soup it was very filling and easy to put together i used the frozen cubed hash brown potatoes which was a huge time saver i too used beef broth and two cans cheddar soup since it was what i had on hand instead of velveetaquick easy and delicious
i used gluten free all purpose flour to make it gluten free for my son also used 2 milk velveeta it was delicious very thick and filling
since i live alone this makes a more soup than i can use at once i didn39t like it frozen i have found that if i make the basenot the cheese and freeze it into 2 or 3 bowls i can then just thaw one of these and add the cheese then
my friend shared this recipe with me a decade ago and it is still a family favorite it is now a football favorite too i make this to sell at our concession stand it always sells out
as we prepared to spend the last part of a frigid christmas day watching our steelers and eagles play i wanted something comforting and easy for dinner and this was it absolutely delicious only adaptation i made was using beef broth instead of chicken broth because that is what i had on hand this has already been added to my recipe blog
why do people review recipes if they modify the ingredients or 34don39t do white flour or velveeta39
my family loved this soup easy to prepared the soup was full bodied creamy and delicious i normally do not use velveeta in anything but in this soup it was perfect
a pretty good recipe but i thought it needed some help the mirepoix makes a real difference to the full flavor of the soup but i did not care for their noticable presence in the finished product solution i pureed them once fully cooked with 1 cup of beef broth that is a second change i made beef not chicken broth for all of the obvious reasons for me a cheesebuger always includes sliced tomato so that brought me to my third modification 1 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices my fourth change was to use a full pound of ground beef i also used the pan drippings to cook the mirepoix which contributes greatly to the meaty flavor of the soup to keep the cooked ground beef moist amp tender i did not return it to the pot until the potatoes were almost done the mirepox puree eliminates the need for the roux to thicken the soup i used the combination of the puree and the starch from the cooked potatoes to create a creamy base for the soup as the cheese melted rather than velveeta which contributes too much salt to the soup i used 4 ounces of cream cheese and 12 ounces of sharp cheddar use the cheese you best like on you cheeseburger the cream cheese also helps with the emulsification of the sauce and made the sour cream unnecessary i finished with salt amp pepper to taste along with a generous 12 teaspoon of dry mustard after all what is a cheeseburger without ketchup the tomatoes and mustard while i made a number of changes that i prefer to this soup i would not have thought of a cheeseburger soup with out this for inspiration
used small red potatoes added and extra cup of broth doubled the meat to 1 lb and left off the carrots super yummy
the best cheeseburger soup ever i substituted homemade velveeta for storebought and white wholewheat flour for the ap my bunch demolished the entire pot so next time i39ll double the recipe
sabrossimo
sorry taste of homedon39t do white flour or velveetayuk
yikes 450 calories and 33 grams of carbs looks great but unhealthy as all get out
the best cheese burger soup ever my family loves it
yummyi am a single senior lady so i cut it in half then i froze the rest for 2 more meals i also substituted white cheddar and mozarella instead of velveta
absolutely love this recipe so quick and easy to make yummmmmmmyyyyy
my kids loved this soup i have to admit though i did take a shortcut to make this a meal i could whip up after work i substituted the prep work and cooking veggies with two cans of vegall it was really good
family loved the recipe and i served it in the bread bowls from this site thank you for sharing we used reall cheese instead of the velveeta
i read williams review which suggested 34his was better34 what is wrong with him to be so childish and mean spirited made the soup for my husband last night and he loved it not exactly the healthiest soup but definitely a crowd pleaser for kids and grown men
love this soup and do share the recipe with everyone i serve it to i find it39s a great way to use up leftover pot roast
we loved this i added a few dashes of texas pete hot sauce to give it a little more pizazze but otherwise made as directed will save and make again
i followed the recipe as written it was delicious a new family favorite
i39ve been making this soup for over 10 years it39s delicious but my original recipe i printed from this website calls for 8 oz of velveeta i think when it39s made with more velveeta it tastes grainy i also always use 11 12 lb of ground beef usually i39m cooking for a large crowd so it goes farther
i have been making this for years and have received many compliments and requests for the recipe
just made this tonighti39m writing this between bites of my second bowlthe empty bowls from the kids says it all delicious period
i make this with cheddar not velveeta
a favorite in our house i have been making it for years if i bring it somewhere i have to share the recipe it39s a keeper i sub out a little of the cheese for a spicy cheese such as pepper jack or hot habanero and add a little bacon
made it for a gathering and received rave reviews from everyone
i39ve been making cheeseburger chowder for 20 years my recipe is betterbut nice attempt lol velveeta

a new family favorite
my family and i love this recipe so much i have shared it with my older sister and her granddaughter said that it was from heaven thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us
this is by far one of the most delicious soups i have made i didn39t have velvetta cheese so used cheese whiz the sour cream makes the soup adds a nice finish to the already great soup i will make this often more of a meal than just a soup
my husband and i loved this soup i did make some adjustments though i only put in 2 cups of potatoes instead of 4 and 8 oz of cheese instead of 16 excellent taste
i made this the other day and my whole family loved it thank you for sharing it
i added bacon
definite keeper my family loved this soup and it will be made again
i39m gonna make this again but definitely with adjustments no celery it39s extremely distracting i39ll also be adding chopped pickles i39ve had another cheeseburger soup recipe that had them and it was delicious who knew right leave out the basil it makes this taste like a spaghetti sauce gone wrong lastly a whole pound of velveeta really i39d cut that to about 14 of that garnish with cheddar if ya want more cheese
i made this soup and it is yummy
i made a double batch and my husband and i loved it
this is great soup it has everything in it my husband loves and he requests it over and over
just okay too much cheese and i even added plenty of extra broth
we aren39t super fans of velveeta so it wasn39t our favorite recipe fun to try though
very delicious and rich and creamy did a few changes just because worked with what i had but still a very awesome succulent soup 4 stars
excellent the only change i made was substituted 8oz sharp cheddar cheese with 8oz velveeta instead of all 16oz velveeta this one is a keeper
delicious i upped the broth since some thought it was too cheesy
really loved this soup definitely appeals to our meatandpotato eatersi substituted cheddar and other cheeses we had on hand for the velveeta and added it a bit at a time adding a bit of cream in with the milk gave it a nice rich feel
we loved this soup great soup for kids cuz what kid doesn39t love a cheeseburger this is just a cheeseburger in a soup i did cut the cheese in half
this soup is absolutely delicious my husband can39t wait for me to make it again
i didn39t like this at all way to much cheese i wish i would have followed my first thought of only adding half the cheese i gave some to my neighbors and they too felt the same way
i took this to a family soup potluck it was a real hit all i took home was the empty crockpot
this soup is simply delicious i served it with homemade rolls and my family loved it definitely to be repeated
i added sliced mushrooms and a zesty red pepper delicious
this recipe is definitely one of my favorite comfort foods always a hit for dinner
i made this on a sat for 8 people 19 yr old grandson that doesn39t eat veggies ask if it had carrots in it he went back for seconds and ask on sun if there was any left that he could have for supper on mon night i didn39t have basil or parsley so left out used 8 oz shredded mexican chees and 8 oz shredded co jack instead of velveeta will be making this a lot this winter i used a full pound of hamb on mon i added a pint of home canned potato soup mix a little more cheese and sour cream so we could have three bowls potato soup mix is in a pint jar put 12 pint jar chopped potatoes 14 pint sliced carrots split the rest of the jar with a layer of chopped celery and chopped onions add 12 teaspoon salt and fill with water pressure can at 10 pounds for 20 minutes this makes a pretty jar for a gift also put the instructions on itto use heat soup mix with 1 tablespoon butter or marg and add one pint milk check the salt and add pepper if you like heat but don39t boil if you need quarts just use the same proportions in a qt jar with 1 teaspoon of salt and pressure at 10 lbs for 25 minutes you can also can just can potatoes or add onions to the potatoes for the same amount of time these are handy to fry or add to soup
very good soup and i will use the whole pound of ground beef and another 12 lb of velvetta or other cheese that i may have on hand the next time around
this soup is excellent it39s quick and easy and very creamy will definitely make this again
this is the best soup i have ever made
i don39t use the bouillon cubes but something called better than broth it39s a paste that has way more flavor and less sodium a tablespoon is enough to flavor about 5 cups of water with a real chicken flavor
this soup is absolutely delicious and one of our family favorites i do tweak this recipe to my family39s taste i also made this soup in our church kitchen for wednesday night dinners and for special occasions serving our visiting ministers and it was definitely a thumbs up i highly recommend this recipe
just made thisit is super delish made few add inschanges added a chicken bouillon sp cube and only 12 tsp sea salt used 10 oz extra sharp white cheddar which i grated only had 10 oz in fridge plus i used 34 cup milk and 34 cup heavy cream crumbled bacon on top and added croutons my hubby added swirl of ketchup and chopped pickles so good people that made this and say it has no flavor put a bouillon cube in there every soup i make i add a cube i don39t understand why ppl don39t cook more with it it adds flavor just cut back on the salt that recipe calls for
love love love this soup my family enjoys it as a meal very hearty don39t let the use of velveta scare you it really works well the recipe is wonderful as written however i occasionally change things up for a slightly different taste my favourite is simply adding 1lb of ground beef instead of 12 a lb and a little cajun seasoning tony chacheres or a can of rotel tomatoes for queso dip flavour kids really liked this
so good i made homemade bread bowls to go with this recipe knocks it out of the park love it
delicious even the kids love it
making this for the 2nd time i switch things around though for my family i use 2 lbs ground beef garlic instead of onion turkey broth instead of chicken i also diced 2 green peppers my taters are gold ones and smaller so i peeled diced 6 topped with diced bacon before servingadds a smoky flavorwe use this as a dip soup mmm the best with scoop chips i make for supper main night then put leftovers in qt canning jarshubs had this at a truck stop one time and says mine is hands down the best soup ever
made this tonight and it was delish changed it by using a can of evaporated milk instead of the regular milk used just over a pound of hamburger 2 cans of chicken broth 2 cups of shredded cheddar and 1 cup velveeta and did not use the flour thickener it was very tasty and hearty will make again
excellent we added some more velveeta and it was cheesy and awesome will definitely make it again
excellent it39s a meal in a bowl i used a pound of ground beef makes it a heartier soup
this soup is rich and delicious this is the second time i39ve made this recipe and i have made a couple of additions i use a pound of hamburger which is perfect for my family we like a punch of flavor so i add a can of rotel i use the emersion blender and all it does is add flavor and it doesn39t change the color i fried some bacon and we added it as a garnish delicious
wonderful
i have been making this soup since i first saw the it in your magazine this is one of our family39s favorites i do add extra ground beef and double the recipe now as my family has grown over the years i like to serve it with homemade bread bowls i am making it again today thanks for the recipe
tastes like a grilled cheeseburger different amp easy good over egg noodles the potatoes seemed strange at first but then they blended in amp reminded me of burger amp fries i tweaked it tripled the beef amp added better than boullion beef flavor a cup each of veggies bumped up the spices campbells beef consomm amp french onion soup plus two cans of water left the potato amount the same amp added more cheese left out the sour cream since it tasted good as is all you need is crusty bread amp a pickle
really yummy i used 1 lb of ground beef to make it more filling will definitely make again
this soup is amazing very easy to make i made mine exactly as the recipe called for
four stars only because it didn39t seem to turn out quite like the others said probably my fault howeveri will definitely make it again because the husband really enjoyed it and i think i know what i did wrong hopefully alsodidn39t change anything
made this last nightwas a hit even my husband who is not a soup fan said it was good will make again could use more meat i skipped the sour cream might try tomatoes next time as others suggested
made the soup with a few modifications i used 16lbs of ground beef 2cartons of chicken broth 1cup of milk and half cup of heavy cream this is the best soup that i have ever eaten and my family loved it
i make this soup in large batches an everyone raves about it and ask for the recipe it freezes well so i always have plenty in the freezer and bring it out to serve with grilled cheese sandwiches when the weather get cold
this soup is so good pure comfort food we like a little more meat so i used a pound of hamburger and replaced the velveeta with vt white cheddar i was low on milk so used a whole can of evaporated milk instead and omitted the sour cream it had the right thickness for our liking this is now in our regular meal rotation
this is our new favorite we leave out the celery but use canned potatoes which cuts down on the cutting time we add a can of stewed tomatoes because a cheeseburger needs ketchup right as many reviewer mentioned this soup tastes even better the second dayif it makes it past the first
hearty supper
best soup we39ve ever had and we really love homemade soups excellent
i39ve always wanted to make a home made soup and i tried this recipe and it came out so good my kids couldn39t get enough of it i even took left overs to my grandmother who is the cook in our family and she gobbled it up and loved it as well my kids are already asking when i39m going to make it again
we love this soup i have to double it it tastes even better the next day
excellent recipe everyone was pleased with the outcome i have been asked to make it again in the future great for a cold blah day this one is a keeper
excellent soup i was leery of using velveeta because i don39t really care for it but it did make the soup even my teenage daughter who can39t stand velveeta tried the soup and loved it next time i would put more meat into it
added the crumbled bacon and it was yummy this soup was a big hit with my crowd will be making this many times over thnx ps don39t skip the velveeta
add some crumbled bacon and dice tomatoes that have been drained absolutely yummy
this is one of our favorite soups i do a about a 14lb more beef though and you can season the meat any way that you like i use 2 velveeta and add jalapenos on the top of mine so delicious
this is for phoebew1 why would you write a review never having made the recipe so you don39t like velveeta use something else doesn39t take a rocket scientist
don39t skip the velveeta it makes this dish velveeta has it39s place and this is one of them food snobs will disagree but it is their lose made again and left out the potatoes and added chopped kosher dill pickle like this even better without the potatoes
excellent next time i am going to add a bit more seasoning to give it more flavor
great soup i gave some to my parents and my dad said 34don39t lose that recipe34
this has become one of my favorite recipes it is very easy and absolutely wonderful
very good my kids even loved it not good for diabetics though however this is in the family recipe book now
great soup this was my first time making this recipe and usually i don3939t make adjustments the first goaround i added 3 tsp of dijon mustard and caraway seed
for my family39s taste i will use more hamburger and less potatoes we all liked it though i followed the recipe exactly but might try some cheddar next time
this is a very tasty easy soup recipe i did make a few changes for my preferences instead of ground beef i used ground turkey and instead of the velveeta i used 4 ounces cream cheese and 8 ounces shredded sharp cheddar because ground turkey really does not require draining i cooked the ground turkey and veggies all at the same time also if you like condiments on your burgers you can always squeeze a little bit into each individual serving might be a great suggestion for making this recipe even more kid friendly i found that dijon mustard works really well this will be a regular goto recipe for me
the soup was yummy and i paired it with garlic bread and a saladi changed the recipe slightly added some garlic and extra cheese
i made this for lunch today and i have to say it is one of the most delicious soups i have ever made creamy cheesy potatoes and beef heaven in a bowl
i made this soup last night for the first time it was delicious and it will be one i use again and again i made some slight changes though i used fresh rosemary and thyme instead of basil really tasty i also used white cheddar in place of velveeta cheese in addition to those changes i did not have sour cream on hand so i made a basic rue as a thickener
i follow this recipe exactly as written amp it39s delicious every time
good recipe but i don39t like using processed cheese either so always substitute with some cheddar and a little cream cheese
for clipnmom 2 cups of cubed cheese measures volume whereas the 8 oz of cheese measures weight so eight ounces of cheese cubed should fill a 16 oz measuring cup
clipnmom 8 oz cheese 2 cups when grated i use cheddar cheese or pepper jack because i don39t like processed cheese i add a dash of worchestershire sauce too crumbled bacon and chopped tomato on top yummy
which is it 8 ounces of cheese or 2cups help please
good soup reminded me of beer cheese soup family loved
this is a wonderful soup recipe i have made it multiple times over the years and it is always a big hit
absolutely delicious i didn39t have enough chicken broth which is unusual for my house so i used beef broth instead and it was delicious my son who usually complains if i put celery in anything ate 2 big bowls and didn39t even notice i diced it very small thank you for sharing
prepared with 1 lb of grd round used half amp half instead of milk thats what i had on hand used real cheese and did not use the sour cream very creamy as is and full of flavor perfect for the 3qt saucepot
modified to a slow cooker recipe and this was truly amazing i will be making this again
i had to make this after seeing it in my email recently and reading several of the 476 reviews there are many items i did change to make it lighter such as using 93 lean ground beef using skim milk omitting the sour cream i chose to use real cheese colby and pepper jack vs processed velveeta i also decided make it in the crockpot 5 hours we basically sauted up the meat vegetables and made the roux then added everything except the dairy into the slow cooker and a half hour before serving placed the milk and cheeses in the crockpot it turned out great it is very creamy flavorful and satisfying on a cold day
found this recipe a few years ago and since then i39ve made it every year as a winter tradition meal my kids would say this is their 1 favorite thing to eat of all time my son even asks for it in the summer any time i ask what they want for dinner his response for years now has been cheeseburger soup
i took this to our church39s annual chili cookoff as an alternative for those who didn39t want chili what a surprise when i won 2nd place people raved and were disappointed when the crockpot was empty i had not made it before but my family says that this needs to be a staple in our meal rotations i track points with weight watchers and even with the velveeta it only comes out to 9ppv not bad for a hearty and satisfying soup
i signed up just to rate this soup by far the best cheeseburger soup recipe i39ve tried to say that it is a family favorite would be an understatement my family friends neighbors and coworkers love it i added a couple of extra things a little paprika and garlic and it really hits the spot
this soup is amazing i will definitely make this again the ideas in the other reviews are something i will try you won39t be dissappointed
my husband ate three bowlfuls amp indicated it was okay i substituted 2 t potato starch for the flour used 1 12 t better than boullion beef base amp shredded cheddar cheese with half and half amp milk
never liked the sound of this until i tried it this recipe is a good starting point i almost always change things to my taste i have used leftover grilled cheeseburgers in this and the flavor that is added from the grilling was amazing also have used some smoked cheddar i had on hand or some spicy nacho cheese from a can i garish with your regular burger toppings tomatoes pickles a1 fried onions mushrooms great soup
this is a hearty and easy go to recipe for my family even my picky eater children like this i substituted cheddar for velveeta and prefer the beef broth to the chicken broth after trying it both ways
this was a big hit at bible study tonight i doubled the recipe two guys went back for a 3rd helping everyone wanted the recipe will definitely make it again
i made this soup but added 1 cup of cooked bacon and 1 tablespoon bacon drippings my family devoured it
this soup is 34great comfort food34 for a cold night i increased my hamburger to 1 lb used 1 cup of heavy cream in at the end and extra velveeta cheese about 4 oz more delicious
i like this recipe better httpswwwtasteofhomecomrecipescheesymeatballsoup
i couldn39t wait to try this soup due to the rave reviews except that is from the nutrition police it is a filling and tasty meal but i couldn39t give it more than 3 stars because to us it was just average i will probably make it again and maybe add more ground beef
we wanted to try this based on all of the good reviews but we did not like it little flavor and a lot of work
i hate ranking this recipe because i did not make this strictly according to the directions because i wanted to make it a bit healthier and i eliminated the meat however i have no doubt that had i used the flour and butter roux it would have made the soup even richer and tastier i was happy to find a cheese soup recipe that didn39t use broccoli since one of my family members doesn39t like it i did double the recipe and it was very good that being said here39s what i did i put the onion celery and carrots and 1 cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for 10 minutes i then added the potatoes the rest of the broth the basil and parsley and simmered for another 10 minutes until the potatoes were done to thicken the soup i then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the brothveggies mix stirring constantly i heated the milk and velveeta in the microwave stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted i added the cheesemilk mix after the potatoes were cooked i did not add any salt and i did not use the sour cream i ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and i served it in homemade bread bowls very very good
this has been a family favorite for years i cut the velveeta in half and to make it simpler i saute my vegetables then make my cream sauce on top of them all in the same pan so good and healthy too
sorry but there are more delish way to pack on 18 grams of fat and over 12 a days worth of sodinm into a singl serving some sodium can be cut by reducing celery who knew it is l is loaded w sodium velveta is tasty but most of fat and salt cone from here i need to look further for another recipe
this was fantastic i followed the recipe as it is given but doubled the batch i was afraid there wouldn39t be enough that39s why i doubled it but it made a lot it was delicious very creamy and satisfying i will be sharing some of what39s left with my mom and will have at least 2 more meals worth for the freezer
i39m not a big soup person but i love this soup i also added bacon bits and since i hatevelveeta i used colbyjack cheese yummmm
changed it up a bit myself added bacon and used the bacon grease to make the rue added 2 c milk skim and lowfat sharp cheddar cheese was delicious
why did i wait so long to try this excellent recipe as is but i tweaked just a tad i doubled the meat and added a little crumbled bacon i like bacon cheeseburgers i subbed extra sharp cheddar for the velveeta because i always have it and never have velveeta i also used plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream i didn39t want to buy a whole carton of sour cream and a single serving of the yogurt worked perfectly thank you joanie shawhan
this is one the best i have ever had next time i will ad 12 pd of ground beef and 12 pd of sausage i like it with a little more flavor i noticed julieeee was going to use sharp cheddar i was wondering if it would be stringy instead of melting all the way but i see someone used it so i will also try that i made it last year for 60 people at my christmas party they all loved it
haha that this should be featured todayi have the ingredients on the counter waiting for this to be made tomorrow i39ve just been longing for 39soup39 weather and it39s finally heading this way it is one of the best soups ever i do change it up now and againthis time i39m using sharp cheddar instead of velveta sometimes i add bacon pieces i39ve tried it using frozen hash browns but did not care for that flavorsome weird after taste that said it39s a wonderful recipe written as is
this is one soup everyone loved great flavor very filling a yummy recipe i need to keep
excellent
absolutely wonderful my entire family loves this recipe and it will become a staple in my list of menu options
this is an excellent meal i didn39t change a thing in the recipe this soup is hearty and so very good just as written i39ve made it for numerous potlucks and other occasions and the pot always goes home empty my son39s friends say this is the best soup they39ve ever tasted
i made this for a work potluck last week and it was a hit
this is awesome soup my husband requests it regularly
yummy even my picky non soup loving family member loved it
this is a perennial favourite i think the velveeta makes the soup tend to develop a skin on top if it cools at all so i usually alter the recipe slightly by making a sauce of the flour butter milk amp real cheddar and then stirring it into the soup i have yet to find someone who doesn39t like this
this was just as delicious as it was easy i substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream i will definitely make it again a little goes a long way very filling
pretty good very thick
this was fantastic like the others i did make a few changes used a full pound of hamburger used beef broth nearly 4 cups not chicken broth used the precooked frozen hash brown potatoes to save time added probably another cup of velveeta plus a big handful of shredded chedder cons took at least an hour to cook with constant attention it39s not a quick meal even with the added beef it barely served six of us and that was with a homemade loaf of bread as a side for dipping
this was delicious i did make a few changes i used 12 lb ground beef 12 pound ground italian sausage and i also threw in 12 jar of real bacon bits and added liquid smoke for even more flavor i used 4 cups of ny sharp cheddar instead of velveeta i also used garden vegetable broth instead of chicken broth since someone i was cooking for is allergic to chicken very flavorful will definitely make again
this is one of our favorites i use beef stock instead of chicken for a meatier flavor but other than that no real changes and as a bonus it freezes well so i can make a double batch and freeze it in single serve containers for lunches or quick dinners
absolutely delicious the only changes i made is that i didn39t add celery i just don39t like celery so i don39t add it to anything and i used real shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed stuff which is much better it probably also made a difference that my broth was homemade yummy
what a great soup printing up copies for friends make it per recipe and tweek to your taste easy to work with
mmmmgood i did add an extra 12 lb hamburger i didn39t even try it with the sour cream because it was so34 good34 already also it just get39s tastier as leftovers thank you for a very tasty soup during this very long very cold winter
this is my most favorite soup ever just the way it is
i use 4 slices bacon in place of butter saute my onion in it then sprinkle the flour over it cook slightly then gradually add milk and stir and add all ing use leftover baked potato or microwave them don39t usually have velveeta so i use sharp cheddar or a mix of what i have no carrot celery or herbs or sour cream add a dash of worcheshire sauce set aside some cooked ground beef from another recipe and it comes together very quickly love this soup
i mixed half cheddar and half velveeta i didn39t have enough velveeta on hand soup turned out delicious and i now get requests from the family to make it again and again
soup was awesome would definitely make it again i used 1 cup shredded cheddar instead of velvetta i just added it to the butter flour mixture and added the milk too then later i added another cup of cheddar cheese soup was not too salty i actually had to add more salt than what the recipe called for also i would definitely not add the sour cream at all i tried the soup before adding sour cream and it was much better than after
super it39s 20 degrees today i knew soup would be perfect this was my first try and it was great thanks for such simple easy to follow instructions and a great recipe loved it
delicious soup my husband and grandson lived every last drop served it with cornbread it is a new family favorite
this is one of the first recipes i made from taste of home my family loves it it is easy to double using a large stock pot since everyone went back for seconds a little time consuming in the preparations but it is well worth it leftovers no way
great soup restraunt at home used it and did give out the recipe said it came from taste of home
this is a nice hearty soup for a cold winter night my husband isn39t a huge soup fan and he went for seconds i did change it up a bit because i won39t use processed cheese i made the rue in a saucepan instead of small skillet and then added the milk to it i then added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the milk mixture and whisked it in so there where no lumps then i added that to the beef and potato mixture in the 3qt saucepan i mixed everything together and then added another cup of shredded cheddar cheese i also added 2 tbsp of dijon mustard to give it more of a burger feel i also used reduced sodium broth and didn39t add the added salt at the end of the recipe in order to keep sodium to a minimum
my family is still talking about this soup and i made it last week
i just finished making this soup my husband and i give it a thumbs up will try it out at work
my picky 3 year old just cleaned her bowl it39s a keeper

super good i will agree with some of the reviews that it is on the salty side but kendya gave great suggestions on how to cut down on some of the sodium content i39ll definitely keep this recipe
i made this last night for dinner and used red potatoes also used herbox chicken broth in place of regular chicken broth did not have celery in the house so just omitted that yum

love this soup such a easy one to make when it39s a fallwinter day
this is our family39s favorite soup we have been making this often since it was first published in 34taste of home34 in 1996
this was very good comfort food is what my daughter called it i used a full lb of ground beef and added a few drops of sriracha sauce i will be making this again
i would give this soup 10 stars if possible i39ve been making it since the recipe was first published in taste of home everyone who tries it raves over it
best soup ever and easy to make loved it
the whole family loved it best soup ever
i love this recipe and so does everyone that has ever had it i originally got this from a friend at work whose mother subscribed to toh i have made this many times over the years i use american cheese cheese slices i didn39t care for the velveeta in it so glad the recipes are all on here makes it so much easier than searching though old magazines
we have been making this since we found the recipe in the toh ground beef cookbook it is my absolute favorite soup recipe it is amazing so good and very filling we have to double the recipe so we have leftovers
i loved it i used ground turkey in place of the beef it stilled turned out good
we enjoy eating this soup and don39t adjust the ingredients but on a lighter note it truly is hard to call it cheeseburger soup who puts potatoes and carrots on their hamburger
it was great
what a hearty yummy easy putyainyourhappyplace soup for a chilly night yum
i have been making this recipe for about 5 years it is one of my family39s favorite39s and the best thing you can add anything else for your own taste
the first soup i make every fall when it finally gets cool
i recall preparing this recipe when it was featured in taste of home and it was delicious i39d used 1 lb ground beef 34 cup sliced carrots 4 cups potatoes peeled and cut in chunks rather than cubed i used 112 cups cheddar cheese 112 cups milk or half and half cream amp used 14 cup ranch dressing instead of sour cream i found that the adjustments worked out for me perhaps dicing the potatoes is betteri39d chunked them instead at any rate i really liked this recipe if i don39t have basil available i39ve used italian seasoning instead i really enjoy the blend of italian seasoning anyway and have turned to it when i season dishes calling for oregano or basildelowenstein
this has been my daughter39s favorite soup recipe since she was in 1st grade she is now 22 and still ask me to make it for her
this is creamy and just like at the restaurant i think i will cook the carrots celery and onion in some broth next time though it seemed dry in the pan and when i served the soup the celery was still a little crisp otherwise fantastic easy to follow directions and very tasty
this was great my family loved it
never made it ha ha on you
excellent i made this for the super bowl one time and my family loved it i ended up leaving the salt and pepper out completely so everyone could add it to their taste and it still tasted amazing without it
i doubled this recipe and it came out soupy so i added leftover mashed potatoes i think if leftover mashed potatoes aren39t on hand i39d try potato flakes to thicken it up
i need to make this again soon the family loved it
made it just as written to extend the leftovers i 34baked34 two potatoes unpeeled in the microwave chopped them and 12 green pepper and added them i topped it with a couple slices cooked bacon
my husband loved this soup he said it was a keeper for sure i did use 2 velveeta instead of regular
i added ketchup mustardand chopped up pickles and it rocked i39d leave the potatoes out next time or else chop then up really tiny
i made this for a church supper and everyone thought it was great i used frozen hash brown potatoes the rue i made in the microwave in a large bowl and added the milk to that and melted the cheese before adding it to the soup pot
super i added 12 lb chopped bacon to mine have some xtra chicken broth in case you want it more soupy great recipewill make many times over
this a winner only change i made was to dice potatoes a little smaller at family39s request
this was so delicious next time i make it i will double the recipe so that we have more leftovers i made it in the early afternoon and left it warming on the stove my boyfriend helped himself to a little bit all day so we only had 2 bowls leftover after dinner have already made this twice and will definitely make again my boyfriend put some ketchup on his to make it taste more like a cheeseburger
this was easy to make and very tasty i used 1 pound of 93 lean hamburger skim milk and all the rest of the ingredients as listed it was yummy and my hubby says it is a keeper
th only thing i will change is the basil i would cut the amount in half i also will experiment and sub oregano for the basil
i made this as a vegetarian dish with yves meatless ground which is better than the frozen kind and usually around 3 for a package that equals 1 pound of ground beef like others i also used cheddar in place of the velveeta and since the meatless ground beef adds texture but not a lot of flavor i also added imitation bacon bits to add a little 34meat34 flavor it came out delicious with a wonderful texture i will certainly be making this again
sounds fab
i questioned some of the ingredients but it was fantastic should be called a cheeseburger potato soup tasted like i was eating a baked potato with a cheeseburger on top the soup also looked like queso dip which made my kids excited to eat it
delicious and super easy made the house smell great on a frigid winter day
my 9 year old daughter and i found this recipe while looking up what to make out of the ordinary with hamburger meat she did most of it with me doing the cutting and it was amazing probably the best soup i39ve ever made and we were both hesitant at first before we started cooking it we browned the meat with a half can of diced green peppers for a mild kick and used baby red potatoes and i cannot wait to have leftovers again tonight we also made some homemade bread and stuffed a slice in each bowl and oh man it was wonderful
this was very good i will use a no salt broth next time though
very tasty soup and my kids and husband really liked it
delicious i will continue to make this soup
my newest favorite soup just gotta be careful when making the rue butter with flour if you overcook it the recipe won39t turn out right like others said it wasn39t hard to make at all helps to use the food processor for the veggies for quicker preperations
one of the best soups i39ve eaten i39m sure i will make it often
simple and delicious most ingredients i normally have i39ve made this before with sliced and shredded cheesewhatever i had in the fridge and it came out great
i made this soup recently for a family gathering and everybody loved it i received lots of compliments and recipe requests i doubled the recipe and used lean hamburger velveeta made with 2 milk 2 milk and light sour cream very tasty
this is one of my goto soups we make a double batch and freeze the left overs makes a good makeahead meal love it
this soup is so easy and my family loves it my 5 year old rarely eats leftovers but has eaten this one 3 times since the first night i made it
i prepared this dish for a holiday gettogether and received great feedback
i got this same recipe 10 years ago and instead of ground beef o have used bacon ham and even venison comes out great every time and i am expected to make it on holidays with my inlaws careful on salt if you use ham or bacon and get rid od grease id you use bacon or ham
knew from the start this recipe needed to be doubled added 1 lb chickenbeef meatballs sliced in half plus about 2 c petite mixed frozen vegetables 10 mins before serving along with a whole wheat hard roll nummy nummy in my tummy
absoultely sensational i love this soup and i am not a big soup eater
excellenti keep the skin on the potatoes instead of velveeta we are not big fans we used pepper jack cheese shredded it really gave this soup a kicki also reduced the salt and used 12tsp pepper keeper
awesome here are some changes we did to the recipe 12c carrotswill do 34c next time did not peel potatoes replaced velveeta with an 8 oz block of pepper jack shreddedreally gave it a kickserved with hot fresh homemade potato bread
i have made this recipe several times now sometimes substituting ground turkey for the beef and it is still excellent i also sometimes add bacon to it to make it a bacon cheeseburger soup
made this just as the recipe says and it was great served it for company and everyone wants the recipe
make some bacon and crumble it on top of the soup before serving delicious
soup tasted great but it tasted nothing like a cheeseburger more like a cheesey potato soup with hamburger added
this was perfect family loved it next time i will double the recipe
this gave me a very good starting recipe to work with for cheeseburger soup because i am feeding 5 adults i used a full pound of ground beef and 14 oz of velveeta and 5 pounds of potatoes i am not a fan of the carrots and celery in this soup so i left them out and added garlic powder a little cayenne powder i also used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of whole milk to have a little more richness in the soupi will make this soup many more times thank you so much for the recipe
i followed this recipe exactly it was so blah no flavor at all i kept adding more cheese and seasonings it looked good but had no taste
i wonder when this poter came up with this recipe becuase i have the exact same recipe i got from a cook book that is at least 20 years oldyes it is a gret soup but this seems to me as if it is copied
i have been making this soup for years and years it is a family favorite and gets rave reviews from everyone who has had it try it you will love it
i made this soup and my whole family loved it it was easy to made and plan to make it often the only think i changed was put in a little more cheese sharp cheddar as we love cheese
i39ve been making a variation of this for years my husband loves ittip it39s way easier to add the extra butter and then the flour to the celery and onion mixture than it is to make a separate roux you have more control over how thick your soup will be and you don39t have to mess up an extra pan it39s an extra step that39s very unnecessary

very tasty and kid friendly
i read some of the other reviews so i added some diced tomato39s and cayenne powder to give it a kick really thick rich soup that sure works on a rainy winter night
absolutely yummy doubled the beef and cheese and 1 12 times the broth to make a bigger batch also cooked it slow in my crock pot for 4 hrs
we39ve been cooking this soup for over ten years now and we still get request for it at every family get together prep takes a little bit of time but oh so worth it
my family all loved this i added a 1lb hamburger but my 6 year old said it needed more next time i will add more but it was very good
the best soup i have ever made cheesey beefy potatoey goodness
our whole family loves this recipelove when the cooler weather gets here so i can get back to making it wouldn39t change a thing
this soup got rave reviews from my hungry hunters last night to shorten up the prep time i have used hashbrowns and frozen celeryonioncarrots we garnished it with shredded cheddar and crispy bacon definitely a keeper recipe
sooo yummy
delicious soup i skipped the basil and added chopped green chile now my hubby39s favorite soup thanks for sharing the recipe

dh and i liked it but my kids wouldn39t even try it it was really good though kind of labor intensive though
this is terrific my whole family loves it
this may not have been the quickest soup to throw together but it was well worth it i can39t wait to make it again i used 1 t each fresh parsley and basil and i used the whole pound of hamburger which was the right amount compared to the amount of potatoes
added a beer hot sauce extra cup of cheddar and chicken broth to give it the kick we wanted served with baguette
i39ve had this recipe in my file for years and made it again the other night my entire family even the complainers about soup love this recipe it39s fairly easy to make and very hearty i use ground turkey instead of ground beef and it39s delicious glad to rediscover it and will be making it more frequently
i39ve been making this for many years my kids grew up eating this and they still love it today the only change i39ve made is that i use american cheese from my deli because i prefer it39s taste wonderful comfort food
i found the recipe while waiting in the dentist office years ago my family loves this soup my children are grown now so at christmas each year i make some of their favorites and freeze them as gifts big winner
everybody loved it
i used a whole pound of ground turkey and 2 whole cans of chicken broth plus a half can of water otherwise i did the recipe as written and it was excellent everyone liked it and it was very hearty will make it again
i have made this soup for years it39s still a favorite of my kids my son continues to request it when he comes over for a meal i make a big batch so that we can have leftovers in the fridge for a couple of days afterward hearty and delicious
this soup was excellent i couldn39t wait for my husband to ghet home from worki had a small bowl at 220 in the pm
great soup i followed the recipe exactly but then ended up adding a tsp of dijon mustard at the end for a little kick
this soup is so good i have to be careful not to make it to often
our whole family loves this recipe i am making it again today our children get to choose what i make for dinner as a part of their birthday celebration and you would hardly believe the elaborate meals i39ve had to prepare in the past this year my son didn39t hesitate for a second before he said 34cheeseburger soup34 that39s pretty high praise
all the chopping and precooking of the hamburger could be done a day ahead gave my husband a big bowl for lunch he came back for more we love this soup and will definitely be making it again would also be good to take to a sick friend wonderful recipe
nice onei liked the recipe
pretty good recipe i made mine lowfat lowcalorie ground turkey no butter but 1 tbps when sauteeing veggies 2 velvetta rf sour cream skim milk etc would make again but add about 4 oz more cheese this time i didn39t think it was cheesy enough tasted better the next day heated up
i really didn39t care for this soup at all sorry to say it was a throw away a waste of time i39ve enjoyed others better
i added another cup of broth and 14 tsp grd red pepper very good even my 18 yr old grandson loved it
i make this soup quite frequently it39s one of our favorites
really good my picky grandkids even liked it i doubled the recipe and served two families
too bland for my taste even though i don39t like spicy foods either i had a lot left over amp if i had served it again intended to add a can of crushed tomatoes instead after a few days in the frig i just threw it out it needed something just not sure what
i made this for our family of six last night it doubles well but takes longer than the given times all of my children ate it without complaining which is a huge achievement three of them gave it compliments i added some petite frozen peas partially defrosted at the end of the cooking time to add some more veggies to our meal i think that it is a new favorite
love it i make it for my family and occasionally for a work potluck it always gets rave reviews sometimes i add a cup of cheddar to it we like it cheesy here
i make this regularly for my husband and i and occasionally for a potluck everyone raves about it i frequently add a cup or so of cheddar but we really like cheese here love it
this was a fun soup to serve everyone added their favorite condiments it was very thick so i added an extra cup of chicken broth and skipped the flour also i did use 1 of burger which made it thicker
i have been making this soup for over 10 yrs it is a favorite with my family
i make this often wonderful flavor my 3 and 5 year old grandkids were over and couldn39t get enough of it
excellent excellent excellent made this for my household and the neighbors and all six people raved about it will definitely make it again
i made this recipe when we were both under the weather i thought it had a very good flavor but i substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for part of the milk i left out the basil but added garlic i went a little lighter on the salt and i39m glad i di i used real cheese instead of velveeta and fewer potatoes the next time i make it i39m going to add at least 8 strips of bacon chopped fine and maybe a hit of dijon mustard to keep it 39cheeseburgery39
i think i was looking for something extra special in this soup but it wasn39t therequite a bit of work for something that tasted merely average
this is really good i added a can of drained diced tomatoesleft out the salt the velveeta has enough for us yum
this is my second time making great recipe the only thing i did different was adding hot sausage with the hamburger i would make again this is a keeper
awesome kids loved it highly recommendused bacon in it and it was greatkids asked for seconds
it was ok i thought it was more of a potato and cheese soup versus a 34cheeseburger soup34
very good modified with turkey and added a can of italian diced tomatoes only drawback is that its a lot of prep time
my five kids absolutely loved this twist on potato soup
just want to say i like buzzbombz suggestions keep up the good work
this was a super tasty soup that my whole family enjoyed hard to do when you have a carnivore an herbivore and an omnivore at the same table i added bacon to it and it was delicious will definitely be making this again
this soup is so flavorful with some crusty bread it was the perfect meal for us
my family was not crazy about this soup it had a comforting quality to it but was lacking in flavor or something none of us cold put our finger on what was missing if i make not again i will experiment a little
this soup is delicious but i only gave it 4 stars because it is so much work i have found an easier version made in the crockpot that i will make from now on
this is by far my favorite soup i did make some changes to make it less fatting i use turkey burger instead of beef burger and cook the onion celery and carrots with the meat ommiting the butter i used skim milk and 2 velveeta cheese and thickened it with cornstarch and cold water i also use fat free sour cream i have made this soup several times and it is sooooo good
excellent everyone in the family loved it
four stars for overabundance of fat sodium content uninteresting seasoningsthought suggestions might be welcome since soup is basically the same name and the different ingredients could offer some flexibility it39s such a simple recipe i never thought to submit it thanks 34chocoholiclady34 for understanding the comments amp reasoninglessened the attack
lilaccrew directions statecheeseburger souptell us what you think of this recipedid you modify it would you make it again and what of your statement is a review very good recipe as is but due for health reasons our family too has since found ways to modify it to meet our needs similar to those buzzbombz posted
buzzbombz why would you give it 4 stars and then post a different recipe you should just review this one and then submit your own separately
i39ve made this soup twice amp both times it was a huge hit everyone loved it including me
this is excellent but i added a minced jalapeno and made it spicy cheeseburger soup
this is a recipe i would definitely make again i made a few changes and used ground turkey breast and shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of velvetta it got rave reviews from my family
wouldn39t change a thing not quick and easy but well worth the trouble i made cream sauce with flour milk and butter then added the cheese then added that to other ingredients whole family loves it
excellent flavor and texture nice spices simple ingredients it becomes more creamy as you stir it the potato cubes become mashed
this was outstanding great comforting soup
make a similar version using ground turkey worchestershire sauce touch of chili powder or tabasco garlic sm can of rotel diced tomatoes bag of frozen corn and 8oz bag of lowfat mexican shredded cheese added toward end don39t need the flour with natural starch from corn amp potatoes very hearty comfort food great with corn bread
i have been making this soup for quite a few years and continue to receive raving comments when serving it to guests it has great flavor when reheated too
i made it for a work fundraiser and it was a big hit i will make it again but we did add some extra seasonings
i have been making this recipe for years and my family loves it i add a 2 large cloves of chopped garlic to give it a garlic burger taste
i made this recipe as is but for my second bowl i added ketchup amp mustard and it was delicious definitely tasted like a cheeseburger
made this hearty and tasty soup for the first time tonight i made the following changes and it turned out delicious increased the meat to 1 increased the onions carrots and celery to 1 cup each slightly increased all the remaining ingredients except for the salt which i decreased to 12 teas used low sodium chicken broth used 12 shredded cheddar and 12 velveeta cheese it39s a bit of work and makes a large batch but it39s good
second time i have made this soup and its excelent my family loves it i used ground deer meat this time
my family just loves this delicious hearty and creamy soup i make a double batch and freeze it for lunches
our kids and i love this recipe but my husband isn39t crazy about it for some reason i make this on nights he has to work
absolutely fantastic followed the recipe exactly it was really delicious definitely will make again
my entire family loved this recipe they usually don39t like much so that is a huge compliment
made this soup tonight the family loved it will definitely put it in the cookbook to make again thanks
great recipe made almost exactly as written left out the sour cream since it was already so creamy my husband and i both loved it and can39t wait to make it again
my family loved this soup we all added hamburger pickle slices to our individual bowls and it gave it a whole new flavor fantastic
delicious especially on a cold day sitting around watching football big hit with my kids it39s a keeper definately would make again
i have made this soup for the family and for church events everyone loves it from kids to the elderly
just made it for the second time and it39s absolutely great i didn39t use as much cheese but i followed the recipe the rest of the way an excellant soup
this soup was awesome my family loved it great flavor and very filling
this soup is wonderful i did use ground turkey instead of ground beef i also did not add salt because there was a lot of salt in the cubes that i used for the chicken broth i love it
easy to fix and absolutely delicious will definitely make this again
sooo good i used more cheese and onion and meat everyone loved it
absolutely delicious this is my family39s new favorite soup i didn39t have celery either and it was still so tasty i added 1 tsp oregano and 1 tsp thyme for extra flavor
cooked again it is very tasty like usually
one of the best hearty soup recipes ever great when the weather turns cool we serve it with my mom39s homemade buttermilk biscuits and everyone loves it
myself mother and extended family makes this soup we all love it i use kraft singles and add cooked bacon
i just got done making this for dinner tonight i used italian sausge meat as well with ground beef turned out good
i have made this often saw an episode of diners drive ins and dives where a restaurant served something almost exactly the same they put some fresh chopped iceburg lettuce and fresh chopped tomatoes in the bottom of the bowl before putting the soup in sounds weird huh know what it39s amazing try it oh and top the soup with some croutons so good
wow very good but i put less butter and cheese another way it will be very buttery and cheesy love it
very good my friend thought he would prefer it with a little less cheese
my family absolutely loved this even my youngest daughter who declares that she does not like soup thanks for posting and sharing
fantastic flavor chowder consistencymy husband and i loved it and will make it again
made this for dinner last night best soup ever my family loved it and can39t wait for me to make it again
i made this soup last night after reading all the wonderful reviews taking a few suggestions from others i added minced garlic instant potatoes one envelope of lipton39s onion soup and bacon bits oh so yummy
take a little of time to get the ingredients ready but it is well worth the time it is a very yummy and filling soup my husband gives it a thumps up and wants me to make it again
i made this soup for dinner last night based on reviews that stated their husbands do not care for soup but loved this one my husband does not care for soup but i love all soups i thought this soup was really good and would definately eat it again my husband said it was ok and would eat it again as a filler the only change i made was to use 1 pound of hamburger i can39t imagine that 12 pound would be enough
amazing i never liked potato soup until this it always seemed bland beforebut this recipe is flavorful and yummy i did add a little red pepper flakes because we like everything spicy i also added a can of mushrooms because my husband like sauted onions and mushrooms on a burger
excellent recipe and directions are easy to follow my only suggestion is to have fun with the recipe and serve pickle relish and ketchup on the side my guestsenjoyed the recipe and laughed made their evening
i have made this recipe for over ten years and everyone always asks for the recipe i also got the recipe from the 1997 cookbook
this is an awesome recipe have made it many times i also have the cookbook that it first came out in i usually double the recipe so i can have leftovers have used frozen hash browns when i39m in a hurry
i made this recipe for our family of three and we ate it two nights in a row that39s how much we all loved it i didn39t add the sour cream so it came out very cheesy which was perfect for us
love this soup hearty and deliciousi did tweak it a little 15 cups beef extra 2c broth 2c gourmet blend of shredded cheese instead of velveeta 12c extra sour creami basically increased the size of the recipe and used shredded cheese instead of velveeta yummy my kids love it
very nice recipe this soup was really good and filling great leftovers for next day lunch too will be making this again thanks for sharing
this is one of our favorite soups thanks you for this great recipe we make this at least 3 times a month
loved this it is not a soup you can through together after work but it doesn39t taste like that either tastes like grandma would have made loved it
i have the cookbook that this recipe is in from 1997 we love this recipe i have substituted a few things cheddar cheese for the velvetta if you do substitute add more salt i think it needs a bit more salt even with velvetta and i cut up red potatoes and leave the skin on and make it so often i don39t even measure anymore but always a hit i love the leftovers for my lunch the next few days so good with some biscuits
for me there wasn39t enough seasoning so i would double the salt and pepper and i39m gonna try it with a clove or two of garlic next time it could be because i omitted the onions no one in my family likes them but with a little change up this would be amazing was still pretty good though
i am not a soup person and i love this soup i can39t wait to have it the next day for lunch it is really good fresh and left over i do use a full pound of ground beef and try to use healthier ingredients such as 2 velveeta lowsodium chicken broth and fatfree milk it is delicious and the extra sodiumfat is not missed
didn39t change a thing turned out delicious next time i won39t cut the potatoes too small like someone suggested
excellent soup i use instant potato flakes to thicken it
i have been making this for years this my husband39s favorite
love this soup it is my kids favorite i even had to write it down for my son when he got married
this dish is absolutely delicious i didn39t change a thing about it and i received more compliments from this recipe than anything i39ve ever made i made a batch and took it work where they were just about licking their bowls
my husband does not like soup very much but he loves this recipe
awesome taste i used leftover taco meat from the night before and added 12 cup of mixed veggies because i only had one baking potato to use
i39ve been making this recipe for years it39s a family favorite especially during those chilly fall and winter months the only change i make is that i use a full pound of ground beef this hearty soup along with some dinner rolls or other bread and you have a wonderful meal
very good i used 1 lb ground beef 1 med onion chopped 1 large carrot shredded and the 14 tops out of 4 celery sticks including the leaves chopped
this soup is amazing i used half and half instead of milk omitted the sour cream and the celery it was perfect and i am making it again this minute
this soup has great flavor i didnt even add any of my own seasonings to it which is something that i almost always do i thought it seemed a little thick so i added about 2 cups of water when boiling the veggies and potatoes and then i also didnt include the sour cream great recipe
i love this soup i first made this last year for a soup pot luck and mine was the one all gone at the end several people wanted the receipe i make this all the time in the winter kids love this soup too i omit the celery cause i hate celery by shredding the carrots you don39t even know they are in there by the time it39s all cooked great way sneaking healthy foods in
this is a favorite at our church functions have made it many times absolutely love it
very quick and easy recipe i had to change up some of the recipe but was still fantastic i substituted a few items for things i already had at home beef broth instead of chicken broth i used real mayo instead of sour cream and i diced baby carrots instead of grating them
this is my one of my favorite soups i usually double the recipe when i fix it i serve this at least 12 times during the winter months kids of all ages love it
i39ve made this soup twicefirst for just my husband and i and the next time for company absolutely wonderful everyone loved iti followed the recipe exactly
i have made this several times and we love it it have become one of our grandchildren39s favorites
i must admit the first time that i saw this recipe i thought no way but tried it anyway my husband amp i have had this twice already it is so tasty amp not at all as heavy as i thought it would be i would definitely recommend this soup
great recipe cut the potatoes in small pieces i cut mine in large chunks and that messed up the texture that was my fault and i will correct it in the future other than that don39t change a thing
it needs something to make it a little zippy next time i may add some peppers and mustard

thought it was delicious great with three cheese bread on a cold day i used 1 lb of beef and it was perfect
i doubled the beef and thought it was much better also you don39t need to peel the potatoes i39ve made it both ways and you can39t tell a difference i only use three cups of potatoes and leave out the salt the velveeta has more than enough salt already
actually maybe i will make this again i used one pound of ground beef like man suggested and it was a little too beefy otherwise good

great recipe i always have precooked ground beef ready to go in my freezer cuts some of the prep time down definitely adhere to the cooking times so the potatoes stay firm

my daughter loves this soup she begs me to make it
we enjoy this recipe but felt the cheese content was too much so we use kraft cheese singles about 10 slices and it still maintains the great flavor

i love this recipe it is great on a cold winter evening
delicious i use 1 lb ground beef and make it a day before i plan to serve it as we think it39s better the second day
i am not a fan of cottage cheese at all outside of substituted for ricotta in lasagna i made this exactly as written it was so easy to put together and so good it was even better reheated for leftovers thank you for this wonderful recipe it could have many substitutions as in meat or cheese and perhaps veggies thrown in i could not get over how flavor filled it was just a total joy to put in my mouth
i made this added fresh spinach green pepper and mushrooms used a swissgruyere cheese combo and some cheddar it still was very bland and i think that was due to the potatoes which really need to be cooked first in order to have any flavor otherwise the potatoes just overpower everything else in it
made this tonight for dinner followed the recipe but added diced ham baby spinach and a handful of cherry tomatoes from the garden family loved it and it can work for any meal
i use diced ham i purchase in the package instead of bacon the bacon was too greasy for me i also add spinach andor green pepper
i love this recipe made it several time and always end up with a clean dish i add extra bacon natures seasoning and use simply potatoes for convenience i make it the night before and take it out the next morning and cook my go to casserole
made this many times and wonderful taken it to different potluck breakfasts and to the home bound and receive many compliments you can easily change things to suit your taste and can change the cheeses but the swiss really does make this stand out
not impressed meshy and salty from that amount of bacon
yummy yummy due to high fat and salt content this is our a treat but yummy
great recipe can i make it a day ahead of time and cook next day thanks rick
i really enjoyed this dish and made it as written cut in half and used 34simply potatoes34 for the hash brown component it was an excellent breakfast twice in the future i39ll probably cut back on the bacon or use leftover ham
this is my go to breakfast casserole i like to add cooked asparagus and extra cheese definitely worth the calories easy to make the night before and bake in the morning
saved this to my home screen folder and will be making it this weekend for dinner thanks for sharing edit 41122made this tonight for dinner we don39t really care for swiss cheese and we couldn39t find gruyere so i subbed about 34 cup of parmigianoreggiano and i used scallions instead of white sweet onion because they give egg dishes a metal taste didn39t need but a half of a teaspoon of kosher salt and about a teaspoon of white pepper i also added some diced green pepper and we both loved it next time i will grate some fresh garlic and sauté the vegetables separately from the bacon delicious definitely a keeper
this was an very tasty recipe i used jimmy dean turkey sausage links cut up instead of bacon i also added a small amount of diced green pepper with the onion i used fat free cheddar jack shredded cheese plus the swiss cheese i did 13 of the recipe and put it in muffin tin it was amazing do try it
i made this during the holidays and it was delicious i am making it again for breakfast tomorrow i highly recommend trying this dish
i39ve made this for several family gatherings and everyone raves about it and wants the recipe it is so cheesy and good
loved thisfollowed to the letterwell i did sprinkle extra cheese on top last few minutes can never have too much cheese have never eaten this sort of hot dish before and first time making it did do half recipe in 8x8 panand mixed up at nightkept in fridgebaked next daygreat resultsthank you for sharing this recipe
delicious as written and so easy to change up for personal preference even my cottage cheese haters loved it i run my cottage cheese through the food processor to give it the consistency of ricotta just takes a minute or two i use this hack for lasagne too
i have made this dish with sausage needless to say the dish was a big hit
this is so easy to make i used bacon and it was delicious and easy we did this as breakfast for dinner but i will use this for breakfast when i have company for the holidays
i love this casserole it is easy to prepare can be made the day before and everyone enjoyed it i doubled the recipe for a houseful of july 4th weekend guests this year and it was the first thing to disappear off the buffet table a definite keeper
i made this for the first time and it as a complete success it was for a brunch women39s bible study its easy to make just a little time consuming other than that love it
this was a very good breakfast casserole i didn39t have bacon on hand i used sausage instead and the casserole tasted great this is going in my recipe book
this is by far my favorite breakfast casserole it is always a hit i made it just like the recipe above the first time and it was good now i add 2 extra eggs for a total of 8 i also use nature seasoning i do bacon the majority of the time but have added sausage as well i also use simply potatoes hash browns in place of frozen
this is an excellent recipe yes it has less eggs than most breakfast casseroles it is more of a hashbrown casserole than egg casserole and that39s ok i made this for my dil39s baby shower and got many compliments and requests for the recipe
it is just my husband and me so i prepared half the recipe and used an 834 x 834 baking dish we thoroughly enjoyed this casserole i put it together the night before and let it sit out for about 30 minutes before baking i will certainly make this recipe again
wow delicious i cooked it in the skillet i fried bacon and onions in and it turned out perfect i usually don39t like breakfast casseroles but this one is amazing
delicious i used turkey bacon and added dried cilantro baked 40 minutes in my 2quart oval glass baker
i have been making this casserole for christmas morning ever since i saw it in taste of home years ago everyone loves it
i made this on christmas eve to serve christmas morning i am so glad i did it was easy and reheated great with a splash of milk to loosen it up a few days later this is a keeper and great to use when you want to save yourself time on a holiday or when you have guests
have been making this one for years i did alter for our taste i use 12 lb bacon and 12 lb ham i add jalapeños and use 10 eggs please note this requires a longer baking time i plan for an hour and a half as i let it stand for 10 minutes before serving
family favorite i add 1012 eggs because an i use spicy chicken sausage instead of bacon sometimes
i was not a big fan it was easy to make but used more ingredients and was more expensive to make than another recipe i have
i make this every year for christmas morning breakfast delicious i use 9 eggs per the recipe i have everything else is the same
this came out delicious and i have to confess i modified it due to what i had in the fridge i used 1lb of italian sausage monterey jack cheese only fresh spinach and baked frozen tater tots 10 minutes i didn39t mix it altogether but built it like a quiche meatonionsspinach mixture on the bottom monterey jack cheese and then the egg cheese and cottage cheese mixture topped it with more jack cheese and i baked it in my 934 x 934 ceramic dish and it was amazing i was a little reluctant to serve it for breakfast as it might be a better lunch or dinner entree but hubby thought it was terrific next time i make it and there will be a next time i39m going to follow the recipe so i39ll have a comparison but i think whatever you do this recipe will always taste amazing thanks for sharing
all ages loved this recipe i make lots of breakfast casserole39s when we travel or when having company i have my 3 favorites that i have rotated for the last 20 plus years and occasionally try new ones now i have 4 favorites because this one is a definite keeper i did exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out perfect the suggestion about green chili39s sounds wonderful and i may try that next time but honestly it doesn39t need it for flavor it seriously was perfect as is thank you for sharing
good recipe even the old boy enjoyed it
i made this exactly as the recipe is here with ham for us and for a neighbor amazing i was tempted to add salt and pepper but really didnt need to my husband is not a fan of casseroles but loved this one it is quick easy and absolutely delicious thank you
was so happy with how this recipe turned out i needed a breakfast casserole for a girls weekend getaway amp this recipe really came through it sounded simple in ingredients amp instruction big plusingredients were readily on hand the only changes i made was to substitute the swiss cheese with pepper jack cheese amp added a dash of granulated garlic chopped green chilies sounded good as well but i have any on handnext time the casserole was so flavorful everyone enjoyed it i will definitely be making this recipe again
looking very delicious
super easy to make and absolutely delicious my husband does not like anything with cottage cheese but he even know there was any in it and he had three servings this will be my new go to
when me and my friends go to the shore we always make this recipe because everyone loves it we just add a little green pepper to it great to make for a group of people
this is probably a good recipe but i think it would be much better if some milk was added to loosen it up
i made this recipe as is but i did cut it in half and it was delicious reading other comments i was surprised to read some of the negative comments this was excellent and i do not know why theirs did not taste great oh well my opinion is this was so easy and i had all the ingredients so i did not have to go out of my house at this time thanks for sharing it
delicious what is the best way to freeze and then thaw out
my family absolutely loves this recipe we have it every christmas morning it39s so easy to make the night before and then i pop it in the oven in the morning before everyone wakes up i didn39t think i would like it because of the cottage cheese but it39s delicious
i39d love to make this however i need to cut it in half and i don39t see the option to do that help
i am interested in the original unaltered recipe please thank you
i am not a big fan of cottage cheese is there anything you can use to replace it in the recipe
the result is exactly like a baconflavored block of cheese can not recommend
littledixie your oven might need to be recalibrated put an over thermometer in to test what your actual temperature in there is and then you can adjust your temp accordingly
great breakfast for everyone
i have used this recipe for years i always mix it together on christmas eve and just pop it in the oven christmas morning i love to add a small can or two of hatch chiles i mention it on my blog here wwwmaternitydessertcom
this was a delicious casserole we liked it so well we ate it for breakfast then had leftovers for supper i subbed ham for the bacon and added some bell peppers so good even the hubby was raving about it lol
this is a great recipe for the holiday39s i use bacon italian sausage
threw most of it down the garbage disposalnot tasty at allnot cheesey enough
my family loves this but it never seems to be done in 3540 minutes my oven is set at 350 what am i dining wrong any suggestions
httpspakistanpropertyinfoblogspotcom201903plotforsaleinbahriatownislamabadhtml
i gave it 4 stars because my son really liked it but my daughter and i thought it was just okay
this recipe has great reviews because it is a great recipe so simple and easy yet so delicious i just added a touch of salt and pepper perfect for brunch
i have made this several times my family loves it it also reheat and freezes well made it with different kinds of meat and cheeses very easy to make made it where i prepared it and baked it right away and made it where i prepared it put in the refrigerator and baked it the next morning both ways are great
i39ve made this same recipe but use a roll of sausage instead of bacon and i use shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cottage cheese
this was great i did add salt and pepper and reserved some of the cheese for the top
my family and friends love this recipe it39s easy to make and versatile sometimes i use ham or sausage instead or add veggies like peppers or change out the kinds of cheese just depends on what39s in my refrigerator its a go to favorite recipe to bring somewhere or eat at home
before i retired i frequently add this casserole for a morning treat for my coworkers and occasionally sent it with my hubby to his job everyone loves it even folks who cringe when you mention cottage cheese it really does just melt right in i usually use build pork sausage like jimmy dean because you can get it together without the mess of cooking up bacon and i increase the amounts of most everything when taking to a groupexact amounts have never seemed to be too importantthe outcome is always great like some others commenting frequently added diced sweet peppers i also make a smaller version in a skillet and bake that for just us at home try this one sure it will become one of your faves too

found this under the title of 34farmers39 casserole34 and have been making it every two days for just over two weeks and have made some changes use a slightly larger casserole dish and do not use frozen anything when the recipe states 34 cup use 1 full cup and no need to let it sit overnight prior to placing in the oven also the time it takes is tricky because it will depend on the ingredients used along with the size of the casserole dish we will place lightly a sheet of aluminum foil over the top for the first 30 minutes so it won39t crust over too badly plus the seasonings need to be adjusted according to your family39s tastes buen provecho
delicious the only thing i changed was using pork sausage instead of bacon everyone had seconds
prepared evening before then baked in morning used sausage onion and green pepper instead of bacon added tsp salt and pepper turned out great
this is our alltime favorite breakfast casserole i39ve been making it for years you can add any kinds of cheeses any kind of meat or vegetables we like using 3c potatoes instead of 4 and gruyere instead of swiss cheese thanks for sharing
this is great i used ham precooked
excellent breakfast casserole i added green pepper and a little garlic to it also served it with salsa and sour cream this freezes well too i divided into two pans baked one and froze the other
this was awesome i39ve been looking for a great breakfast casserole for years and this is truly wonderful i made it initially for a weekly teacher breakfast at my school i thought i had made too much instead everyone gobbled it up and there was none left my only complaint is that i found it to be just a little bland the recipe calls for no additional spiceswhich i thought was sort of odd i browned the hash browns which takes forever good lord but otherwise followed the recipe exactly i made it the night before and then baked it in the morning before i left for work this also turned out quite well the second time i made it tonight i added a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs and the overall mixture i also added some truly excellent hot sauce my husband and i love to the eggs and into the whole mixture just a few dribbles i basically added blindly it turned out so well just gave it enough heat to be interesting but not overpowering my hot sauce is not for the faint of heartso if you39re using something less insane like frank39s or sriracha you made need more additionally my swiss cheese bag was 1 12 cupsi figured extra cheese makes everyone happier and i just added all of it d i think there39s a lot of wiggle room to make it however it makes you happy but seriously make this it39s da bomb
followed the recipe to a t and 8 people devoured this very easy to put together which i did the day before and baked in the morning not great on the waste line but a definite keeper
delicious next time i might try using sausage instead of bacon and adding green chilies or maybe not as it was good just the way it was definitely a winner
ive made this numerous times with 4 cottage cheese and even 2 and it still tasted both great my father in law and husband who are not fans of cottage cheese loved it and wouldn39t have even known there was cottage cheese in there i have also used part skim cheese and it didn39t make a significant difference just to make recipe lighter i had a bag of potatoes to use up one time and chopped them into chunks and boiled them drained and used the recipe as is and they were delicious if you are looking to not use the frozen bag onesboth ways are phenomenal but the skim substitutes makes per serving a bit lighter for those who are not looking for those who are watching their waist line excellent recipe and is a go to when i have a huge brunch and family visiting in town
huge hit with my family super easy to throw together have made many different variations with this recipe spicey sausage monteray jack cheese instead of swiss cheese and added a small jar of salsa for a delicious mexican twist meat lovers style with half of a pound of each sausage bacon and ham and veggy with sauteed red and yellow peppers spinach onion and mushrooms with sliced tomatoes on top all fantastic
one of my favorite goto recipes
i make this for special holiday brunches my family loves it
easy to prepare and really enjoyed the taste and texture i added ham cubes and parsle instead of bacon the hash brown weren39t totally thawed so i needed to bake it an additional 10 minutes next time i want to add asparagus or spinach for added flavor and nutritional value will be part of my 34family34 recipe cookbook
i save bacon grease so instead of using a pound of bacon i saute the onions in approximately 3tbs of bacon grease and add a pack of the store bought diced ham i follow the rest of the directions the ba on grease gives it a little bacon taste and the ham makes it seem meatier
good one
very easy quick and tasty i used sausage instead of bacon a real family hit
not many recipes have 258 reviews i made this for supper for my adult son and i the other night i had read a lot of the reviews and also checked out other recipe sites online for the same recipe title i used a dozen eggs and roughly chopped half a container of fresh sliced mushrooms from costco which i fried with the onions in the same pan as i had fried the bacon i used low sodium separately i added a generous amount of freshly ground pepper my son loves it but didn39t add salt as i felt the bacon and the cheese would provide enough seeing as i hadn39t made this before i didn39t make any other changes unusual for me it was a wholesome meal i accompanied it with a dish of stewed herb and spice whole tomatoes but will use vine ripened local ones when they are available i might even fry fresh tomato halves in the leftover bacon drippings i will also serve it with a variety of relish and chutney recipes i make another reviewer39s comment about using salsa is an option before warming the leftovers my son asked me to ramp up the flavour so i sprinkled some cayenne and garlic powder on the top and then added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese i was pleased with the result i don39t like food as hotspicy as my son and my son thought it was an improvement he wants me to make another one next week mixing the cayenne and garlic into the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish adding a bit more of both than i39d put on the one i reheated obviously a personal preference he also wants me to substitute half the hash browns for thawed mixed veggies i39ll also add the whole 500g container of cottage cheese that39s 12 cup more than in this recipe as we both love cheese really pleased to find this recipe thanks beth notaro for sharing it reminds me of an old order mennonite friend i had who died too early a few years ago with cancer i39m sure that association added to my enjoyment of this casserole i39m sure i39ll be making this countless times with numerous variations as well as ones close to the original i like the idea that it39s bread and gluten free as i have friends who are conscious of needing to avoid gluten
made this several times and always a hiti use bulk sausage in place of the bacon just my preferencedefinitely one of my favorite go to recipes for an easy and tasty breakfast or brunch dish
we made this for our guests on christmas morning a huge hit even for the picky eaters we also crave it for lunch and dinner now
made this for a church pot luck and brought home an empty dish i did use hot sausage instead of bacon and liked the flavor it added
fantastic i use this for holiday breakfast time when family comes over i make it up the night before and it39s so easy for morning i add some additional ingredients like mushrooms and green peppers everyone enjoys
i make this several times a year i bring it to staff breakfasts at my school as well always a hit
yummy make it again
used sausage instead of bacon added 12 cup milk 2 minced garlic cloves and 12 tsp black pepper very good
very good will make again for sure
family enjoyed it
it was ok not bad but not super
made this on a beach trip used potatoes o39brien and added mushrooms used shredded bacon cheddar cheese and sharp cheddar this was fantastic so many different things you could add loved it
i made this as the recipe directed except i prepared my bacon on a sheet pan in the oven and then added it along with drippings to the skillet with onion and it was delicious the first batch went to the kids at church so my own family requested a batch for home simple to prepare hearty and satisfying
i made this with ham and green chilis so my husband could grab a scoop and heat it up quick before heading off to work in the mornings he loved it and thought the recipe deserved 4 and a half stars he said he left the half star off because there might be a little too much cheese will try with bacon and less cheese next time
is there a substitute for the cottage cheese i39m not too fond of the texture of cottage cheese this recipe sounds great otherwise
served this for guests and everyone enjoyed it i used hot turkey sausage instead of bacon and monterey jack cheese instead of swiss i seasoned the eggs and threw in some red bell pepper because i had it on hand i made it the day before and did not thaw the hash browns per another reviewer39s suggestion worked great next time i39ll add some diced green chiles or hot peppers to spice it up a bit more really good
i made this for saturday dinner and my son and i like it i substituted sausage for bacon the next time i think i might add green pepper definitely a keeper
i made this and it was a huge hit substituted sausage for bacon since i didn39t have bacon added chopped up red pepper instead of onions as well served with homemade biscuits and fruit will make again
i like recipes where i have all the ingredients so tasty and easy to fix and a family that finds eggs a problem enjoyed every bite of this and when we39re having this again next saturday when we will have guest thanks for this breakfast reciperosemary
recently made this one it was very good will definitely make again
the whole family loves this when i39ve brought this dish for potluck gatherings literally everyone asks for the recipe
this is one of our favorite recipes we like it with hamgood way to use leftovers i39m going to do what one other reviewer did and try ricotta cheese this time since i have some i need to use thanks for recipe
very delicious i cut the recipie in half and used an 8x8 baking dish i assembled it the night before and popped it in the oven this morning
cooking 1 pound of bacon and a medium onion together does not work onion burns before the bacon is crisp on medium heat do them separately or start the bacon well before adding the onion
my mom has made this for years and is the 34go to34 recipe when all of the family is over for breakfast excellent
i used to make this several years ago we really enjoyed it
a definite keeper i39ve made this for gatherings of both family and friends this recipe is hit and i make it just as the recipe identifies guests always ask for the recipe
i have two breakfast casseroles that i traditionally make and this one is hands down the favorite based on the good reviews i used my sunday school class as guinea pigs and made this recipe because it is enough to feed a group there was not one bite left and many request for the recipe i did put together the casserole the day before and took it out the next morning to bake i needed about 5 minutes more baking time 45 minutes total also based on some of the other reviewers suggestions i added a small can of diced green chiles which added perfect flavor overall this dish is a winner
i thought the mixture looked dry for an egg casserole so i added 14 cup of milk don39t do it i had to bake it longer because of the extra moisture follow the directions it tasted excellent
this breakfast casserole was delicious i cooked it in the cast iron skillet i cooked the bacon in then served it with sliced avocado and tomatoes
this sounds wonderful does anyone know if it can be put together and then frozen for later use
i have made this several times and it is so good i took it to an easter brunch we had at church and there wasn39t even a crumb left i got asked for the recipe a loti agree with andreasmom2u mary needs to make the recipe before commenting
mary did you even make this it sounds like you didn39t based on your comment if that39s the case you have no right reviewing it this is a wonderful breakfast treat please keep your negativity and baseless commentary to yourself
this sounds good but way too many fat calories from the cheese
this was great i used ricotta instead of cottage cheese yummy everyone except my daughter enjoyed it but she hates almost everything
made with sausage instead of bacon did not thaw hash browns and made the night before refrigerated overnight very good
would like to cook in crockpot any idea how long to cook
everybody loves this recipe i don39t thaw the hash browns if making the night before i just mix as instructed and put in the refrigerator since everything is cold i add 10 more minutes to baking time
so simple and tasty
would prefer that people not preach their own opinions that refer to ingredients all can read the recipe and understand and decide if it39s to their liking
very good i added green chili39s as well and it was awesomei think the negative people are real downers and takes away from the fun of this site please everyonebe positive
my grandsons love this casserole i have to make 2 for the 6 boys always a hit i use 1 12 pound drained sausage and a dozen eggs for each casserole and more cheese and potatoes one casserole doesn39t feed a dozen people
used sausage instead of bacon added mushrooms and green peppers love this recipe
it looks good but i can39t have the cheese why does everything have to have cheese what can i use in place of it
really great breakfast dish i like to add green chilies along with some salt and pepper
added green chilis and chopped red pepper it turned out really good
i enjoyed this casserole and served it for easter breakfast at my house we really liked the combination of the cheddar and swiss cheeses i did add some seasoned salt and pepper to taste as i thought it needed some seasoning
i followed this recipe exactly and would never made this dish again everyone who tried it thought it was missing something and i agreed maybe green peppers or ground mustard
the best ever i add bacon and sausage this morning with onion and peppers i used jalepeno cheese and cheddar very moist too a must try if you haven39t
easy casserole to make and excellent flavor
changed this up just a tiny bit used 8 eggs 6 cups hash browns and diced ham instead of the bacon it was a huge hit for the guys at the cabin nice hearty breakfast before a day of snowmobiling in wisconsin39s north woods and the leftovers were terrific the next morning
delicious i made 2 dishes of this one with ham and one with sausage added a couple extra eggs to one dish next time i make this i will also add a couple extra egg giving the dish a little more fluff
delicious i added a handful of diced ham along with the bacon just because really liked the hash brown base quick and easy to prepare the family loved it multiple requests to for the recipe will definitely make this again
i prepare breakfast for 1216 methodist fellows once a month and this particular recipe is their favorite it contains all the ingredients in one place
this is the best breakfast casserole i have ever made i cut into 15 pieces and freeze thaw in refrigerator the number of squares you want overnight heat in microwave and you have a quick week day breakfast great served with grits and toast
i just have a question about this recipe it looks really yummy has anyone made this exactly how the recipe say39s the night before baking and if so did it turn out good
i made this recipe for a church event and it was gone in minutes there was another breakfast casserole dish next to it and mine was gone way before the other i used browned breakfast sausage and 12 eggs i didn39t have swiss cheese so i didn39t use it and truth be told we didn39t miss it i think the extra cheese would have made it too rich and greasy i baked for 1 hour 15 minutes in my oven likely due to the extra eggs the addition of cottage cheese was an unexpected surprise but i didn39t even notice it was there if anything it added moisture to the dish so that it would not be too dry this is a great glutenfree recipe to breakfast casseroles that use bread i also prepped this dish in a pan and let it sit overnight before baking in the morning next time i might add a small can of green chiles to the mix this will be my goto recipe for breakfast casserole
i loved this recipe i substitued sage sausage for the bacon and it was a big hit i think it could pass as a side dish for any meal
made this last night for my husband and me we both thought it was just ok way too cheesy if i make it again i would definitely cut the cottage cheese in half as we felt it was overwhelming and cut back a bit on the other cheeses as well although the recipe calls for quite a bit of bacon we felt the dish could39ve used more maybe next time i39ll substitute chopped link sausages for more substance not sure the potatoes add much to the dish but overall a good basic recipe that can be improved with a few tweaks so i39m glad i tried it thanks for sharing
i have been making this recipe for years everybody loves it i always make it without the meat for those darn vegetarians in our lives meat on the side for the rest of us always a hit
i used a four cheese mexican blend and cubed turkey ham instead and it went over big time it is good
have made this numerous times in my home and everyone loves it i fry up country sausage and onion make the bacon in the microwave so it39s not so greasy and i place the sausage and onion mixture at the bottom of the pan and add the rest on top to die for
finally a recipe that doesn39t have a lot of hot spices added to it i go to an amish town in missouri and enjoy food that has natural seasoning and taste without all the spices
used bacon ham and sw hash browns fabulous
with this many positive reviews and yayyy i39m 200 i felt like this was a nobrainer to try it was deliciouseasy to throw together hearty and simple to tweak i am having a bunch of summer guests staying with us and i plan to make this a staple breakfast dish thank you for sharing
i made this for a family brunch and everyone loved it
this recipe is a keeper the newest addition to my recipe file today is the first time i had tried this casserole our cousin was dropping off some papers when she got to the door amp she wanted to know what smelled so good i invited her to come on in amp eat she said my husband amp brother are with me i said there is plenty tell them to come in toomakes alot recipe is not dry moist amp is the perfect breakfast or lunch
used both sausage and bacon delicious
i made this casserole for supper per the recipe amp it was wonderful if you love bacon and hash browns this is the meal i did end up baking it for about 55 minutes since i felt like it might not be done in the middle knife wasn39t coming out clean served with mixed fruit and bagels will definitely be making again
i only used half the onion and added other veggies mushrooms tomato green pepper etc drain excess water after cooking i also sprinkled with pepper as well everyone loved it
good stuff for breakfast
good easygood staple for a morning brunch
this is a good dish for breakfast or brunch i used potatoes that i shredded myself and left out the swiss cheese it turned out delicious
great recipe i added chopped up broccoli sausage and pepperoni slices great flavori have made this twice and my husband loved it makes for great leftovers too
this is a great recipe i added diced green chili39s but don39t think it originated with the amish as they don39t have electricity to keep frozen hash browns they live very frugally without electricity
ok easy to make not a strong flavor bacon was a nice change from sausage but maybe could use some vegetable
made exactly as written this was amazing
really good didnt add cottage cheese for personal preferences and turn out amazing made for 7 and had no leftovers
i made this this morning but halved the recipe since i didn39t have the exact ingredients i browned the onionsbacon and added red and green peppers i used 6oz of leftover sour cream and onion dip the one in the container i didn39t have cottage cheese and added a little extra cheddar cheese to sub for not having the swiss it came out excellent very flavorful using the dip mix it was even better baking it in my cast iron pan nicely browned on the bottom this will be in our breakfast rotation
this is a christmas brunch dish which is always on my menudelicious it is super simple to assemble the night before and just pop in the oven to bake on christmas morning my six sons and their dad all love it
this is so tasty the last time i made this i used breakfast sausage and i really prefer it with bacon i like the fact that it doesn39t have to sit overnight in the fridge when i have a crowd for breakfast this is the casserole that i make the whole family loves it i prefer this to the one that doesn39t include the cottage cheese one piece makes you want more addicting
really great made a few substitutions due to what i had on hand used both bacon and crumbled sausage frozen diced onion and peppers and monterey jack for the swiss cheese omitted the cottage cheese not my favorite and a few dashes of hot sauce will be my go to casserole for any meal or that special breakfastbrunch thank you
great casserole amp loved every bit of it for the ones who said this was tasteless maybe you don39t know how to cook so you should start taking cooking class 101
very bland
the whole family loves this casserole nice for when you have a houseful for breakfast very easy to make and i like the fact you don39t have to let it sit overnight i39ve made it with bacon several times now next time may try with sausage
i made this breakfast casserole for a staff breakfast at work it was super easy to make i prepped the bacon and onions the night before and then threw the rest together and baked it in the morning before work everybody loved it and a few people asked for the recipe it literally disappeared within a few minutes no leftovers
i made this for easter brunch it definitely deserves 5 stars it fed a crowd adults and children ate it all i did not have cottage cheese on hand but used ricotta cheese which i did have on hand it would have been a little more moist if i had used cottage cheese which i will do next time i put it together the day before and refrigerated it overnight perfect great recipe delicious this will be my go to breakfast casserole to serve alongside pillsbury39s french toast bake casserole and a virginia baked ham
didn39t have bacon on hand so i made the recipe with 1 tube of jimmy dean sausage but followed the rest of the recipe exactly the ladies at church now know exactly what they will assign me to bring to brunch from now on
i always make this recipe for easter sunday breakfast i love it
easy and delicious great if you39re feeding many for two we had leftovers for a few days and didn39t get sick of it
i make this every easter and every bit of it goes so good i prep it the night before and toss it in a pan on easter morning couldn39t be easier i use sausage sometimes to switch it up
this was good and a nice change but i felt it needed a bit more flavor for my tastes i liked that it used potatoes instread of bread i did add ground pepper but felt it still needed something else i will try it again but next time will try some of the other suggestions like pepper jack cheese instead of swisss andor southwest potatoes instead of plain potatoes andor the addition of sautéed peppers and garlic this is just a personal preference for something with a little more 34kick34
really yummy especially with breakfast sausage i was worried there wouldn39t be enough flavor but there totally was i sprinkled pepper in it and used mozzarella instead of swiss cheese just because i39m not the biggest fan of swiss cheese this would also be a really easy recipe to halve
yummy and easy it was the perfect size to feed a large group this will be served at our home
this is a wonderful breakfast casserole i make this up in several small pans and then send one to our daughter in college she loves it even rewarmed
this is the best breakfast casserole i39ve ever made or eaten i take it to our monthly birthday parties at work and get lots of raves and asking for the recipe i use sausage and add more eggs than what it calls for
this was the best b39fast casserole we have had very good i added pepper and also some hot sauce to it awesome d
made this for xmas breakfast it was the most tasteless breakfast casserole i have ever madeglad i also made biscuits and sausage gravy i had 34 that i had to throw in the garbage would not recommend at all too many other great breakfast casserole39s available
our family really enjoys this breakfast dish it is so much better than those that are based on bread and you don39t have to wait with it in the fridge overnight i used pork sausage instead of bacon but like both
i made this over the holiday and guests really liked it i thought it was too rich with all the bacon and cheese next time i39d probably half the bacon and increase the amount of hash browns in the recipe i also used 2 cottage cheese
i first made this for guests they loved it and wanted the recipe we like it as well and have made it again it39s a great company breakfast casserole
this is an amazing amp easytomake casserolei always prepare it on christmas eve and throw it in the oven christmas morning
excellent the entire family loved it

had a small group and halved the recipe and it was still so yummy i used cubed hashbrowns because that39s what i had on hand had to cook it 375 for the last 10mins to get it to finish great dish for groups big and small
this was awesome only substituted mozzarella for the swiss because we don39t really like swiss
this was awesome we don39t really like swiss cheese so i substituted mozzarella though
i made this recipe for a brunch held after my 40th high school reunion for our committee i made 2 and their was not a crumb left plus several classmates requested the recipe
love this make it for work all the time because it works for those needing gluten free always takes longer to cook then this says though
my family loves this we39ve even had it for dinner
although this is a great recipe on it39s own i39ve sauteed bell peppers wthe onions and added green chilis just gives it a little extra kick i rate the original recipe very highly everyone loves it
this recipe is so easy amp delicious and the left overs were just as tasty reheated this recipe is awesome as is but next time i make this i want to try fresh mushrooms amp maybe some green pepper
awesome
i made this for a mother39s day breakfast for my family instead of bacon i used a hamsteak it was very good
very yummy and easy to make will definitely make again
very tasty would definitely make again and again and again
i made this for easter assembled everything saturday night and left it in the fridge and threw it in the oven for 45 mins on sunday morning so good i used a pound of lunch meat ham instead of bacon and added chopped mushrooms as well very good
quick yummy and my kids even ate it
my favorite breakfast casserole by far i usually make it with 1lb of bob evans sausage instead of the bacon because i keep it frozen one of our favorites
everybody loved it on a rv trip so much that i wouldn39t count on serving 12 more like 6
made recipe as is but used more eggs for pot luck made it healthier for myself using shreddred summer squash in place of potatoes and was excellent amp none knew the difference
this is a great casserole for breakfast or any other meal it lends itself to being very adaptable i used pepperjack and a little less cheese also i have tried it with spicy italian sausage and another time with diced polish kielbasa always rave reviews from the peanut gallery
this is my go to recipe when i am having overnight guests love it
my family loved it
easy and delicious
tasty and easy to create but somewhat bland i will definitely make it again adding green amp red peppers perhaps black olives my son added salsa as a topping saying it was perfect
this was good but can use improving i used 8 eggs didn39t have swiss cheese so used some sour cream added salt and it still needed some when i served it very good idea and you can definitely play with the recipe add ingredients that you like
excellent always goes fast
i made some changes due to suggestions from other reviewers i used 9 eggs instead of 6 i used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese because i really dislike cottage cheese my potatoes were added frozen because i did not notice that the recipe said thawed the casserole was very very dry i assume it was because i added too many eggs the flavor was good and i will try this recipe again only this time i will not make any changes to the original recipe
made this for company breakfast and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe making it today again so easy and i think i cut back slightly on fat and it was still good a definite keeper
this was so easy to make and everyone in my family loved it this casserold will be a mainstay in my family for many years
this was great i would add a couple more eggs but even without doing that this was great as in it was all gone with no leftovers
my husband really liked this used sasuage amp added a dash of cayenne pepper will try pepper jack next time we like kick
i have been using this recipe from toh for years and we still love it i do change it up sometimessausage instead of bacon add green chilies different cheeseit39s always great i do always have to bake it a little longer than called for and i let it stand a little longer than called for alsoif we can wait that long to dig in it
although this recipe was great as is i added 2 more eggs and substituted smoked gouda cheese for the swiss and that really put it over the top
didn39t have swiss so just used cheddar and added green peppers very tasty all the kids and hubby liked it we made it for supper with a little left over the kids want the left overs for breakfast
this is the recipe that i use to feed a hungry crowdwhen i made it the first time i followed the recipe to the letter it was wonderfulover time the only changes that i make is that i use 9 eggs instead of just 6 i have also made it using breakfast sausage in place of the bacon i imagine it would be good with ham too yum
way to much cheese to little eggs only 2 out 10 people finished it
easy and great tasting and the kids all like it
i made it first time the way the recipe suggests for a breakfast with my son and grandchildren it was well received the basic rescipe lends itself to variations of your choice so i39ve used smoke cured ham bulk breakfast sausage smoked sausages and even crabmeat and shrimp i added fresh sliced mushrooms red bellpeppers and even the long green chile peppers seeded and diced small i made fresh salsa with cilantro and served it on the side ialso made fresh biscuits with butter and honey and a fresh fruit or melon great breakfast
simply delicious have made this several times and it39s always a huge hit i always add extra meat sausage and canadian bacon i never have leftovers
made this for a family brunch and divided into 2 pans 1 wbacon and 1 without for a vegetarian and both were a big hit i followed various people39s suggestions substituted cottage cheese with ricotta and used half mexican cheese and half mexican cheese with taco seasoning for a little kick very easy to make and yummy
i made this for breakfast for the 4th of july and it was fantastic it was super easy and really enjoyable i did make one substitution i don39t like cottage cheese i don39t even like the idea of cottage cheese so i used ricotta cheese instead and it was perfect this is a recipe to keep
it was alright my husband did not really like it but he liked that it kept him full for a long time
i put my own spin on this recipe i didn39t use the bacon but instead use ham and added mushrooms and used cheddar cheese i made it for company and everyone enjoyed
i made this for an employee breakfast at work today and it was hit
made this for some company and it was a big hit even though i cooked it for the full time and let it stand before serving the very center had not set up fully but that won39t stop me from serving this dish regularly
i39ve made this recipe several times each time i have omitted the onion and replaced the bacon with sausage it39s always a hit
i made this for our lwml breakfast meeting and it was a great hit any leftovers freeze well
wow this is an awesome recipei cut it in half substituted feta for the cheddar and hot pork sausage for the bacon since there are only 3 in my family that gave me a meal for one breakfast and i froze the other half for another morning this is so easy and my hubby who doesn39t really care for casseroles for breakfast said it was a 34keeper34
this is soooooooooooo good
my husband liked the recipe i used ham slices that i had it was good
i followed the recipe exactly as stated it baked to a lovely golden brown i served today to teachers at a staff appreciation brunch they loved it and i brought home an empty container less than an hour later i39ve added this to my 34go to34 list of recipes
my soninlaw says he hates cottage cheese but he declared this recipe 34a keeper34 because i was feeding a crowd i added a few more eggs a pound of lil smokie links sliced yes i also added the bacon as directed and switched the cheddar and swiss for a combo of cheeses we had on hand i liked the kick the pepper jack cheese gave it hearty and delish
this recipe is tasty and easy to make i gave it 4 stars as it could be considered a little bland next time i39m going to try pepperjack instead of swissall in all i liked it and would not hesitate to make this dish again thanks for the recipe
this recipe is tasty and easy to make i gave it 4 stars as it could be considered a little bland next time i39m going to try pepperjack instead of swissall in all i liked it and would not hesitate to make this dish again thanks for the recipe
quick simple and delicious
my family loves this casserole i had to alter it a bit for my large family i use 812 eggs use pepper jack cheese instead of swiss and add a couple spoonfuls of sour cream i also substitute sausage when i didn39t have bacon and it was just as delicious this adds to my cooking time approximately 5060 minutes total but it is worth the wait
absolutely delicious a family favourite
i made breakfast for dinner and the entire casserole was eaten everyone had seconds
i made it without the bacon i didn39t have any and it was still fabulous great recipe thanks
i made this recipe for family visiting from out of town and it was a hit they took the recipe home and used it for a family gathering over christmaseveryone wanted the recipe easy recipe and excellent tasting
i blended the cottage cheese and eggs 8 eggs in a blender and added 14th cup of milk i also substituted cubed ham for the bacon i sauteed up a yellow onion and mushrooms to add i omitted the swiss cheese i also added salt pepper ground mustard and garlic powder this was supper yummy my husband likes to eat this with salsa would be okay with ketchup for kids
this recipe was easy to make and tasty however i found it very bland i was worried when preparing it that it would be but wasn39t sure if the saltiness of the bacon would be enough so i didn39t alter the recipe except to make it with 10 eggs after eating it i would definitely add salt and pepper and maybe even some green and red peppers it has the potential to be a wonderful recipe
this recipe is ok but i have another similar recipe we like much better i think the hashed browns make this a little heavy
trust me you don39t taste the cottage cheese my son and husband can39t stand cottage cheese but they don39t even know it39s in the recipe i am so craving this recipe now too
enjoyed the cottage cheese made it creamy easy to make and i used turkey sausage vs bacon
made this for christmas eve brunch 2011 everyone said it was deliciousnext year i will make 2 9x1339s because it was gone so fast after people took seconds and thirds i didn39t change anything in the recipe however i did make it the day before covered it and put it in the refrigerator i took it out 30 minutes before i baked it it is a keeper and the only breakfast casserole i will make from now on
i am eating this as i speak it is really good flavorful i added chopped ham instead of bacon and i had a block of irish cheddar so i used that instead of the standard orange other than that the recipe is the same oh and i added a little bit of green onions along with the sweet the cottage cheese makes it creamy and delicious excellent brunch dish
delicious i have never made a breakfast casserole before because none of the other recipes appealed to me this one was a big hit for a holiday breakfast
we have tried this with bacon and sausage and enjoyed both
this was kind of boring by itself but a good standard to add green chilies and spices could probably also use only one cheese
made this again this morning absolutely love it i double the eggs 12 total and sauté red and green pepper to throw in it delicious we even eat it for dinner too
this was soooo good and easy i took it to work and everyone loved it i followed the recipe except i did put 10 eggs next time i think i will add green pepper and mushrooms you can39t taste the cottage cheese but don39t leave it outi think it inhances the taste of the other cheeses
delicious kids and adults alike loved it
i made this last year for christmas breakfast and all my family loved it i cooked the bacon and onion mix the night before and put it in a sealed bowl till the morning and was perfect to mix the last bit and pop in the oven while presents were being opened it has been requested for a repeat christmas breakfast again this year
excellent everybody wanted more
really good and easy too i used a combo of bacon and sausage that worked out well
delicious made with 12 eggs and turkey sausage a very easy and cheap meal that the entire family will enjoy also for those who don39t like cottage cheese you can39t taste it in this dish a bit
after i made this recipe i have39nt even triedanother one this is a keeper
made this when i had family in from out of town and every on loved it so much they asked for a copy of the recipe
yummy and for 34grampa34 who doesn39t like cottage cheese you won39t notice it if you put it in a blender with the eggsi39ve changed the recipe by using less potatoes hubby can39t eat a lot of carbs and adding fresh spinach mushrooms amp bell peppers it also can be spiced up lots more if that39s your taste very adaptable recipe
simply amazing my wife and i tried this one out a few months ago and it immeadiately became a weekly dish a must try
i made the amish breakfast casserole this week for friends everyone gave it 1010 however cholesterol wise it39s quite a bit when you consider all the cheese it39s a great recipe for a one dish breakfast will do a repeat again when we have guests for breakfast of for a brunchottawa ontario canada
lot of potatoes and potato taste in this recipe almost tastes like a hashbrown casserole
this is my first time writing a review for a recipe but this one deserved a review it was that good this was so tasty i made it just as directed except i used a pound of sausage bob evans breakfast sausage be sure to let stand for 10 minutes in fact i think 15 minutes is better i made it quicker by frying the sausage a day ahead
does anyone know if this can be made ahead and frozen it is delicious and i39d like to have it in the freezer for unexpected company
i want to make this casserole for company has anyone tried making it and freezing it ahead of time
i will make this again and again my family and coworkers love this a tip to make it even quicker is that i used a package of the oscar meyer real bacon bits you find on the salad dressing aisle and it was fantastic this is a recipe i will keep forever and so quick and easy to make
am so glad that you posted this as this is more than just a 5 stareveryone loves this thank you for this wonderful recipe
pi always use 12 eggs but otherwise follow this to a t and love it have tried with both bacon and turkey sausage and it39s great both waysp
there are never any leftovers when i make this it is hearty and delicious
i made this as a test to see if it39s what i wanted to take to a bridal shower it was great i did follow the advice of one lady and made it with 12 eggs and 30 oz hash browns so it would be a little bigger being from the southwest you can39t make an egg dish without throwing in green chili i bought the frozen kind and drained it before adding since it was bigger i baked it an hour
easy and delicious
i made this for my kids this morning and they both gave me 2 thumbs up easy and delicious
this is a great recipe one reviewer said hers turned out dry gas and electric ovens don39t cook the same for anything you cook if you39re using a gas oven lower the temp by 15 degrees
i made this for my husband the other night he loved it instead of the cottage cheese i added a little more shredded cheese and extra hash browns i also cut up an extra tomato i had laying around and threw some green orange and red peppers on tops just for color was soooo good will make it again very soon
this was very tasty and relatively easy to make made with bacon and next time i will try the breakfast sausage
i made this for our ladies bible study today and everyone luved iti did make a few changes because i needed it to make a lager casserolei used 12 eggs instead of sixmy hashbrowns was a 30 oz bagand i added extra cheddar cheese to the top when it was done and left it just long enough 2 meltwe r big on cheddar cheesewas very goodmight try it another way next time r make as recipe calls 4 i just needed a bigger casserole this morninthanks 4 sharing will be making it again
i made this casserole yesterday with 1 lb of breakfast sausage it39s okay but don39t think it has enough flavor that i would make it again
my daughter is going back to college this morning and i wanted to make something she would enjoy amp get her back on the road to finish up her last year of college we all enjoyed this very much
wow this was great i used extrasharp cheddar cheese my husband and kids loved it thank you for a great recipe i will use a lot
we were snowed in and i made this and it is fantastic cannot wait to make it again i used bob evans sausage since i had it on hand and probably used close to 5 cups of shredded hashbrowns to make it firmer my husband and i love it and this is our new favorite breakfast casserole now the next time i will use bacon instead to see if it is as good
i have made this for christmas morning the last two years it is a hit i substitue monterey jack for the swiss and i cook the bacon and onion up the night before and measure out the other ingredients in a large bowl basically do everything except add the eggs i do that in the morning i get it out a few minutes earlier and bake it a little longer works really well
very good made for faimly
i made this for our christmas morning breakfast and we really enjoyed it now that i39ve tried it once i would add some additional ingredients next time i made it
made this for a bible study brunch and was a huge success the potatoes are a welcomed change from bread and the cottage cheese makes it oh so creamy wouldn39t change a thing and will definately make again
being i39m watching the fat intake i found this recipe easy to defat with turkey bacon and lowfat or no fat cheeses if you don39t have frozen hash browns shred or dice the potatoes
i haven39t tried it yet but wonder how the amish prepared potatoes for it i39m sure they didn39t use frozen hash browns
this recipe is delicious to the person who would like to substitute ricotta instead of cottage cheese that would work fine also but since ricotta is alot more expensive you might consider just putting your cootage cheese through a food processor or blender and your cottage cheese hater will not know the difference
has anyone ommited the cottage cheese and used something else i have one in the family that if they see cottage cheese they won39t use it would ricotta cheese work
i have made this for christmas morning the last 3 years in a row delicious for breakfast or dinner
i have had this recipe from taste of home years ago and it is a staple in my family it feeds alot of people and everyone loves it i use chives or scallions instead of onion
this recipe is the same one i found in a quilters cookbook several years ago i make it all the time i like the sausage but i also use canadian bacon it39s easier and a little less fat give it a try we like this recipe with pancakes
looked this up a few days before christmas when seraching for breakfast idaes we really liked this made it for christmas breaksfast for the fisrt time and it had nice presentation for guests very easy to make i reduced the onion used sweet onion because i don39t really care for onions i will make again thanks
my husband loved this dish he said it needs to replace our annual tradition of breakfast pie see other taste of home recipe for christmas breakfast
i made this on xmas eve to serve xmas morningvery goodit is already slotted for the menu for xmas 2011
this is my new favorite breakfast casserole great as written or do as we do and add in other meats amp veggies we have on hand the cottage cheese in it adds creamy goodness
our family loves this
i substituted sausage for the bacon and omitted the onions and received rave reviews on christmas morning it39s a keeper
everyone in the family thought it was very good next time will sub mozza cheese for the swiss
good flavor but mine turned out a little on the dry side i think it needs a little milk
i prepared this for our family christmas breakfast my family devoured it it is so easy i made it the night before and refrigrated it and put it in the oven to cook while we opened presents it was great i added cubed ham to it it was delicious it is now on the menu for next year
we did not enjoy this casserole my family all agreed that our alltime favorite egg casserole by jimmy dean is much better
i can honestly say that i have not yet tried this recipe but my husband and i love brunch i am amish decendent yoder and they have the best country and simple brunch dishesi can tell just by readind the ingredient39s that i will make this dish and have created my own simular to this recipe that it is a hit
my family really liked this casserole the next time i make it i want to try other veggies and meat i think you can do a lot with this and it will always taste good
friends loved it used ham instead of bacon and it was absolutely delicious
this was delicious i made it with ham instead of bacon since that was what i had on hand i also used tator tots and broke them up as that was what i had it needed to cook a bit extra as the tator tots were not completely thawed out it made me nervous at first as it didn39t seem to be setting up but i just cooked it til a knife came out clean and it turned out great
have been making this for years we love it i39ve even used leftover spamoniongreen pepper and cheese which we use for a grilled sandwhich
delicious will make this again i didn39t have fresh onion so i used minced instead and didn39t have any swiss so i used extra cheddar mm mmm good
wanted to try something new for xmas morning we39ve had the same thing every year for a while i made it early to give it a try and avery one loved it even the kids
i make this at least once a month however i39ve tweaked it to our liking i use a lb of bacon and a lb of sausagei also make my own homemade hashbrowns and brown them with onions we like them better if they are cooked to make them a little crunchier than the frozen ones used in the original recipe i also put 12 of the mixture in the pan and then put swiss slices and the rest on top with cheddar to cover the topguess you could say all i use the recipe for anymore is a list of ingredients but it was awesome as it is written as well
loved this recipe my daughter had a birthday sleepover with 8 girls and this made enough for all of them they loved and it was a good lower carb recipe as to one of the girls is a diabetic needless to say that girls mom walked out the door with this recipe too
i39ve made this many times used ham bacon amp hot sausage i always use fresh potatoes for the lady that said her potatoes were brown all you need to do is soak them in water as soon as you take them out of food processor it is so much cheaper this way instead of buying the frozen ones and i always have potatoes on hand
this is the best wonderful flavor and so easy stir everything all together night before have tried many egg stratus and this is by far the best company all wanted the recipe
had guests for breakfast on sunday 6 adults ate the entire pan i used one lb of bulk italian sausage instead of bacon i added two more eggs and i used the entire bag of potato39s this will become a regular dish at our house when i shared this with a friend she said this dish is safe for those with celiac disease because no bread
i added a handful of left over italian sausage from the previous nights lasagna omitted thw swiss cheese and used freshly shredded potatoes it turned out a bit dark from the fresh potatos but we all really enjoyed it there was enough for left overs the next morning which were even better
it39s a favorite at home and church
excellent casserole easy and delicious i cook for the young adults for our church and this is one of their favorite dishes
we fix this recipe often it is great to prepare it the night before and bake it in the morning try this with sausage or ham my family loves this recipe
i made this recipe for a special family brunch and it was the absolute best i used 1 12 pounds of sausage and 12 eggs instead of swiss cheese i used a colbyjack mix to make sure it was spicey enough i added a pinch of cayenne pepper even with these additions it served only 8 this is my new favorite brunch recipe
i make this for brunch with the ladies my good friend is wheatintolerant she loves this recipe
this casserole was fantastic will try sausage next time i don39t feel this recipe is 12 servings as stated i feel it39s more like 8 or 9
i made this recipe last weekend and loved it i used sausage in place of bacon this recipe will be tagged as one of our favorites
my husband and i made this amish breakfast casserole on valentines day for a family breakfast brunch absolutely a hit very good the next day too
this is a deliious breakfast casserole my entire family enjoyed it i am making it again this weekend while we are snowed in thank you for submiting it
needed something for a birthday food day at workthis was easy delicious and everyone loved it i highly recommend it
excellent really really good i used kielbasa instead of bacon and it was fantastic a hit with the entire family
we had 28 family members coming for breakfast on christmas morning so we had two different recipes to try and this one was a hit no one had any idea cottage cheese was in it i cooked the chopped onions with the bacon and used the freeze dried hashbrowns just added the water and waited 10 min and then added everything and baked next year we are only going to make this recipe we added a ham fresh fruit and a stuffed french toast casserole and everyone was happy
the most delicious breakfast cassarole i39ve ever made
oh my this turned out just perfect i made a half batch just in case we didn39t care for it and it was gone in no time i39ve been looking for a simple breakfast recipe to serve thanksgiving morning and this is it i used breakfast sausage in place of the bacon and i skipped the onions on accident still it was just perfect it39s like a cheesy quiche meets yummy scrambled eggs thanks for sharing
this was delicious i like sauteing my onions in the bacon drippings i added chopped bell pepper and used the cheeses i had on hand no swiss it is an easy recipe and is easy to make changes to fit what is in your pantry
i love this recipe every time i make it i have an empty pan i like to fry the bacon and cut the onion up the night before to cut down on prep time in the morning
i have made this recipe multiple times and our ladies sunday school class asks for it everytime there is a ladies brunch etc i use a pound of real bacon bits instead of cooking up bacon dried onion pieces can be used in place of chopped onion i increase the eggs to 12 use 1 package of shredded hash brown potatoes 1620 oz package from the refrigerator section i chop up sliced swiss cheese since i can never find shredded swiss already packaged and make no changes on the cottage cheese this casserole is a big hit and by using some of the easier ways to get ingredients it is not hard to make i have never tried to freeze this but since i am making one for sunday i may try freezing a small amount to see how it holds up
this is one of my favorites we are on a cooking team with four other couples at st bartholomew39s episcopal church in wichita kansas each week a team cooks breakfast every sunday during the year my husband and i take turns choosing what we want to fix this is high on my list as the cottage cheese makes it so moist and deliciousi vary on the cheddar cheese and use what i have on hand sometimes i may add two or more different cheeses when i make a triple batch i add different meats as well to the casserole depending what is on sale at the store this is always a big hit with our parish of 45 peoplewe charge a 200 donation to cover the cost of the meal and what money is over the cost goes back to the church as my husband would say 34 the best 200 breakfast in town diane chambers
this recipe is soooo good i make it all the time for potluck breakfasts amp brunches
delicious cupcakes left out the cinnamon in the frosting i had some pumpkin cookies that i put in the food processor and sprinkled on the top of the frosted cupcakes were amazing
absolutely love these we have these for every birthday now not just in fall
best cupcakes ever i am not usually a fan of pumpkin so i really just made these for my familybut i love them we have now made them several times and they are delicious the only change we make is leaving out the ginger because we thought it might be too strong in the cupcakes
this is an amazing recipe gonna be the hero this thanksgiving so so perfect in every way that little bit of ginger is genius
fantastic cupcake frosting has the taste of a cin roll great combination
these were so good i only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar but probably could have gotten away with 2 cups and i only used 1 tsp cinnamon in the frosting because i didn39t want the cinnamon to over power it i have frosting left over amp may make another batch to give away
very moist light texture delicious only fault with this recipe is that it was entirely too much frosting next time i will make half as much frosting great recipe made 27 cupcakes
i think i39ve established a new holiday staple in our home i used my stand mixer and followed manufacturer39s guidelines on speed and length of time for mixing ingredients at each step of the way the cupcakes came out tender and fluffy a definite hit with my family and another family we shared with we will definitely cook these again during pumpkin season
we use less sugar in the frosting also and it39s still delicious try with craisins in the batter with the candied pecans on top
i didn39t plan on baking today but i received this recipe in my email and wow the cupcakes are amazing they didn39t rise up much but thats ok just eat another to make up for it i don39t think i have ever baked a cake without vanilla extract and the batter recipe didn39t call for it so i added some the added vanilla made the cupcakes almost too sweet and i love sweet but next time i won39t add any there is already some vanilla in the frosting that is probably enough also this recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes plus a small bundt cake you could easily get 3 dozen cupcakes from this recipe i will definitely make this recipe again it is a keeper
i want to make this but i want to use mini foil pans do i need to change anything
these were sooo good i altered one thing only used 2c of powdered sugar in the icing and it was plenty sweet for us i will definitely make these again
i think your kitchen tip of lightly beating cupcakes actually caused them to have zero air and therefore rise so now i have dense flat cupcakes not a good tip for coloradoans good flavor but
yes it is i have made it at approximately 5200 feet elevation with perfect results
is this recipe already adjusted for altitude haven39t tried it yet but looks good
these were awesome i did however fill them with a whipped cream and vanilla pumkin spiced pudding it just added that wow factor
i made these today they were easy to make and the recipe was easy to follow i am taking them to a party and i39m sure everyone will love them i39m sure i will be making them year round we love pumpkin
i made these last nightfollowed the recipe completely didn39t change a thing they were amazingi made them for my husband for work they were gone quick he said i will for sure be making these again
these are absolutely delicious it is one of my favorite fall cakes to make the cake has a nice spice and it39s not dry the cinnamon in the cream cheese frosting is the perfect finishing touch
i just made these and the frosting seems awfully denseshouldn39t there be some milk or half and half mixed in with conf sugar to make it light and fluffy
hello im about to make this recipe one question can i use regular milk instead of buttermilk
hi i39m about to try these out do you use salted or unsalted butterupdate used salted butter these are the best cupcakes i have ever cooked by far and i39m not even a pumpkin fan the pumpkin flavor is light and it balances so well with the cinammon cream cheese frosting thank you so much i will be making these every fall for the rest of my life
to maryi used salted butter and they turned out great i only use unsalted if it39s specified in the recipe
this recipe is absolute perfection i brought the cupcakes to a bake sale at work and have gotten better reviews i used powdered buttermilk mixed in with the dry ingredients rather than liquid buttermilk but the consistency was excellent perfectly moist these are perfect for fall and i will make them over and over
i used all organic ingredients my husband gave these two thumbs up and said 39intense pumpkin flavor39 next time i make them i will add raisins to the batter and sprinkle crushed candied pecans over the frosting superb cupcakes and an easy recipe happy fall y39all
so good i39m making these for my fall wedding making sure the butter and cream cheese are at room temp helped ensure a silky smooth frosting the spice level in both the frosting and the cupcake is spot on the cupcakes have fresh pure ingredients so they39re heavierdenser than box mix cupcakes these are on my top 5 cupcakes list
these are the best
i39ve made this recipe about five times and it comes out beautifully each time i even made it for my sister39s wedding and everyone loved it the cupcakes are a little denser than a regular cupcake but i like them that way
i made these for a bake sale and they were a huge hit
i made these a few weeks ago and have many requests for more and for the recipe making them this weekend for a pot luck dinner think i will make copies of the recipes to hand out i know i39ll be asked
my daughter won her cooking competition with these they taste fantastic highly reccomend
the cupcakes and icing turned out great i doubled the recipe but instead of using 5 cups of sugar for the cupcakes i only used 3 it came out perfectly sweet with the 3 cups
awesome taste my family loved these i had enough left over to make a small pumpkin loaf next time i am going to make this as loaves instead of cupcakes
delicious i39ve made these several times and have taken to work everyone raves about them and comes looking for more my children also love them people who don39t like pumpkin have tried them and say they are awesome
after i submitted my review i saw it was for the pumpkin cupcakes and not the pumpkin cookies so sorry i did make these cupcakes also and they are scrumptious
very moist and tastey the frosting was delicious and the added cinnamon topped it off my boyfriend who is not even a big sweets person ate them 2 days in a row and my kids loved them even better the next day
these are delicious very moist amp the icing made themthese are the best pumpkin cupcakes ever
i have been making these for years an they are always the talk of the party the only thing that i do different is use one big can of 29oz of pumpkin instead of 15oz and it just makes it so much more moist and more pie like
everyone absolutely loved them and begged me for the recipe i made according to recipe as written
moist and delicious just as good as all the great reviews stated i will definitely be keeping this one
good but not as amazing as i had hoped by the reviews
i was told by several people at my husbands work that these were the best cupcakes they have ever eaten in their life very moist but yet stay together and don39t fall apart the icing was definitely a winner as well
made these today and they are wonderful they are moist and very flavorful frosting taste great with the cinnamon added will definitely make again
i don39t normally make comments but these cupcakes were so good that i had to the flavors all blend together well and the cupcakes are super moist i am not a huge fan of pumpkin but i loved these these are great cupcakes for thanksgiving
very good made these and gave some to my neighbors all good comments i am so making these again i added some sugared ginger instead of regular ginger
delicious followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice 1 12 tsp cinnamon12 tsp ground nutmeg12 tsp ground ginger14 tsp ground cloves
i don39t like pumpkin but this was absolutely amazing i work at a restaurant and on busy weekends i take in cupcakes i tried this and it was a winner even i had seconds this recipe is fantastic and i can39t wait to make them again thank you so much for sharing
this is the perfect autumn recipe the cake is moist and boasts a mild pumpkin flavor that is perfectly spiced the tang of the cream cheese frosting is mellowed with the warmth of cinnamon the combination is divine i made two 11x13 sheet cakes i stacked one on top of the other with a thin layer of icing in between and a layer of frosting on top it was devoured and all who tried it loved it
can39t wait to try
really good but were a bit spongy and some didn39t rise
love love love
these are the best ever
love these cupcakes they were a hit how long would i have to bake these in a loaf pan
love love love this recipe
just made these for harvest day at work they are very tasty
very good and moist love the icing
these were great
these were the best made these for an office party and they didn39t last very long
by far the best recipe for pumpkin cupcakes i have ever tried i have made these for the fall season for many years and they are a favorite of my family
i didn39t try the cream cheese frosting recipe provided but instead bought the coolwhip cream cheese frosting in the freezer section added 1tsp cinnamon and it was so light and fluffy not overpowering sweet less calories and sugar yum
i made this cake on 101313 this is one of the best cake i39ve had it39s very moist and i love it i just change one thing and that was the ginger i added allspice instead love it
mmm mmm great
delicious moist and baked up beautifully gorgeous orange hue to them too i used my own recipe for cream cheese frosting and added a bit of maple syrup for a flavor twist great recipe
these cupcakes are amazing the only thing i changed was reducing the sugar to 2 cups i thought 2 12 would be a little too sweet for my taste and i think i was right cause they turned out perfectly sweet i can39t say enough about how good these are the spices are spot on and i love that it calls for butter i won39t use vegetable oil or shortening yum
i love this recipe but i didn39t actually go ingredient by ingredient i accidentally forgot to add the canned pumpkin lol i was ready to throw the batch out but to my surprise the cupcakes were very tasty i even added a crumb topping to some i did add a bit more buttermilk cinnamon and pumpkin spice to my batch i also omitted the ginger i will be making this again and hopefully this time i will not forget the pumpkin
excellent flavor and really easy i was able to substitute greek yogurt for the buttermilk and my cupcakes were great and perfectly moist i was also able to do it without an electric mixer so that39s a plus
this disappeared at our family christmas dinner easy to make i cheated and used whipped cream cheese frosting though and very tasty they don39t puff up a lot so fill the cups full the cake is fairly heavy but a good consistency i will definitely be making these again
easy to make moist and delicious
believe it or not i have purchased bad powder before you can test the freshness of your powder by puttingspan a few tablespoons of warm water warm tap water is fine but cold water is not into a small bowl and adding a teaspoon of baking powder it should make a fizzing noise and then the baking powder will begin to fizz and the water will become very cloudy with tiny bubbles the more bubbles the fresher the baking powderspan the other thing you should do is double check your oven temperature oven thermometers are inexpensive and imperative to baking my own oven tends to run hot
i was so eager to try this reciped for a friend who loves pumpkin spiced cupcakes i made this recipe to the t using all of the same ingredients following the instructions exactly and making sure to bake them at the right temperature and everything i dont understand but my cupcakes are coming out songeymushy and not rising at all i dont think its the baking powder because i just bought a new one the other day if anyone knows why this is happening id really appreciate it if you could let me know really sad the batter and frosting will all have to go to waste
fantastic cupcakes they were a huge hit and people keep asking me for the recipe instead of pumpkin pie spice i just added some extra cinnamon nutmeg and cloves these cupcakes really taste like a pumpkin pie not just a spice cake loved the frosting as well the cinammon adds that extra special taste would definitely recommend trying
i made these cupcakes four time over the thanksgiving holiday for friends and family they are unbelieveable huge reviews from all i did add more pumpkin spice and cinnamon to batter also added more cinnamon to frosting wonderful moist and delicious this is a keeper recipe
these cupcakes have rave reviews for a reason they are amazing you won39t regret it if you try them
simple and delicious the spiced frosting was the star of these cupcakes i topped mine with a few slivered almonds as a nice garnish great recipe
these were fantastic everyone who has tried them wants more than one the recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes but in the future think i will cut the frosting in half there was a lot of it left over
everyone loved them i39m making them again for thanksgiving
not only is this recipe simple it is absolutely fabulous these home made cupcakes come out perfect every time with just the right amount of spice the are moist and delish the icing is the perfect compliment to these tasty morsels i will make them again and again
i don39t usually bake but stumbled across this recipe while searching for a pumpkin dessert i live at 8k feet so cakes are a real challenge this is delicious and easy i followed it and added half a walnut to the tops it made exactly 24 perfect cupcakes and the frosting was the right amount i took them for dessert to a gathering and they were a huge hit
this is a fabulous recipe my friend wanted a good seasonal cupcake recipe after she volunteered to bake desserts for another friend39s november baby shower i volunteered to help and after baking a test batch we made just a couple of alterations for the 34pumpkin spice34 we used fresh ground cloves and nutmeg about a tablespoon and a half total of approximately equal parts nutmeg and clove and we increased the cinnamon by a half teaspoonfor my palate i39d add even more spice in the future likely the nutmeg and clove but generally the spice level seems good for most people i decreased the amount of sugar in the frosting by a half cup and might even reduce it by a full cup in the future along with adding about 14 cup more cream cheese we also added about 12 to 34 of a vanilla bean split the bean and scrape out along with the cinnamon which made it a really rich tasting frostingif you have a pastry bag with decorative frosting tips you can frost them that way and the cupcakes look professionally made nice to take to parties and holiday events to top them off we sprinkled finely chopped candied ginger on top of the finished frosting
i made these for a teachers luncheon and kept a dozen for my family i haven39t heard anything back yet from the teachers or pta but the ones in my house were gone within 2 days they are moist and taste like pumpkin pie in a wrapper i am making again today to take to a friend who just had a baby and we will keep the rest yum
terrific recipe think they are even better the next day without the frosting they make a wonderful muffin
wow these are amazing i used 14 c applesauce and 12 cup butter as opposed to 34 c butter they are so moist and flavorful thanks for sharing
the best dessert i39ve ever had they are mouth watering and you can39t just have one
i buy a small container of buttermilk use what i need and freeze the rest in 1 cup increments in labeled freezer bagslay them flat til they freeze then you can stand them up for easier storage
using pureéd fresh pumpkin would likely alter the taste of this recipe quite a bit if not drastically i am a huge fan of using fresh pumpkin substitute an many pumpkin recipes though and happy to learn someone has provided guidance to alter thanks keverwann but i made it with canned pumpkin exactly as written because of the raves and they turned out fabulous definitely a keeper here
followed this recipe exactly and they are amazing
i thought this recipe was great i put hershey39s cinnamon and premier white chips in them as well and they turned out great
i simply loved these cupcakes delicious and very easy the one thing i did to improve them was add 2 tablespoons of grade a maple syrup to the frostings to kick up the fall flavors also to anyone having trouble with to runny frosting your butter or cream cheese was to soft
yummy and so cute
great cupcakes i cut the frosting in half as suggested by other users but ran out with 4 cupcakes left i decorated the cupcakes exactly as pictured i would suggest making a full batch of the frosting and freezing any leftovers for future baking projects it is delicious
worth the worki used homemade pumpkin puree 1 34 cup instead of the canned pumpkin made my own pumpkin pie spice and used soured milk instead of the buttermilki think the recipe needed a little less liquid on the day i made it but i went against my better judgement and used all the recipe called for thus the cupcakes didn39t set fast enough in the oven and had 34hat brims34 of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice domei also made half of the frosting as suggested by previous reviewers and it covered all 30 not 24 as the recipe claims cupcakes nicely the frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for what i think is a lot of cinnamonas to why frosting might not be setting up as mentioned by alie0717 if you make cream cheese frosting with lowfat neufchatel cheese or fatfree cream cheese it doesn39t have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only fullfat or regular cream cheese remember the cream cheese is replacing butter in quick buttercream frosting to make cream cheese frosting
this recipe was yumo loved the cinnamon spice in it gave some to the fire house and they loved them toowill make them again
this recipe is delicious however i have made it more than once and the frosting is always super liquidy no clue why i39ve even tried making it with extra powdered sugar
i39ve had this recipe for a while but didn39t make them until this year boy did i regret that these were the best cupcakes i39ve ever made my boyfriend won39t let me share them with anybody i brought them to work and everyone wanted the recipe i39ll be making these every year for the rest of my life more than likely
this is a great recipe i made it for the guys poker night and they loved it
seriously the best cupcakes ive ever made
just made for the 1st time for my county fair extension project and walked away with grand champion only thing i did different was the frosting because of cream cheese restrictions so used a buttercream instead with a touch of cinnamon added but this recipe is to die for soooo moist and i39m not a huge pumpkin fan but these are great would highly recommend they also make about 30 cupcakes so for a big batch great recipe maybe for just my family i might cut in half
pthese cupcakes are awesomep
delicious and so moist i added about 12 cup of applesauce to make them extra moist and they taste great
this recipe is awesome i39ve made it twice now and both times it has come out moist and deliciousit has awesome texturelight and fluffy this is my new go to recipe for cupcakes for sure
very moist and delicious however the amount of icing this recipe makes is way more than you need i halved the recipe put it on thick and still had some left over
made these cupcakes tonight and my son and i loved them will definetively make again thanks for sharing
my daughter made these and they were devine she used nutmeg for ginger since we didn39t have any and instead of buying buttermilk for this one recipe she used the milkvinegar substitute wonderful i hope she makes these again
everyone was so impressed when i made theselove them
this recipie is always a winner at my house it39s also popular for school bake sales and events i have had friends who do not like pumpkin eat these up and ask for seconds they might not like pumkin pie but this pumpkin spice cupcake is a winner
i made these cupcakes for a holiday party and everyone loved them i made it exactly according to the recipe this could definitely make about 30 cupcakes if you wanted to stretch it instead of the stars like the picture i used a round tip to make a swirl design that turned out really cute
wonderfull taste and texture
these get rave reviews every time i make them
i have made this recipe and have reviewed already i was wondering if anyone has made this as a bread using loaf pans its so good as cupcakes i would love to make it as bread any input appreciated thanks
incredible recipe used fresh pumpkin came out so moist and rich used leftover frosting on everything including cheesecake and pumpkin pie
these were good but i did take others advice and cut the sugar down to 2 cups and they were still a little sweet for me but yummy all the same
these got my finicky husband39s stamp of approval as an acceptable substitute for pumpkin roll at thanksgiving i piped the frosting on with a star tip as shown and had a lot left over will make a halfbatch of frosting next time
easy to make and a huge hit
everyone i gave a cupcake to loved it they were by far some of the best cupcakes i have ever had i have already made them twice and plan on making them again for the holidays
delish the icing is fantastic
these cupcakes are so delicious everybody that tried them said they were the best cupcakes they ever had i will definitely make these cupcakes again
i39ve never had so many compliments and requests for recipes as i39ve had with these yummy cupcakes they were a hit with adults as well as kids at our church potluck it tends to make more than 24 cupcakes which was fine with me definately a keeper in my recipe box
these cupcakes are amazing my husband who rarely comments on my cooking asked where i have been hiding this recipe and my 9 yr old daughter asked if i could make them for her class followed recipe exactly swirled frosting on with pampered chef accent decorator have had several people ask for the recipe
i make this recipe for my bunko ladies and these cupcakes were a huge hit one lady said it was the best cupcake she had ever eaten all asked for the recipe very easy to make and will make over and over
great recipe very moist and easy to make big hit with my family will definitely make again
i made these last week and decorated them to look like pumpkins looked cute and tasted amazing they were a hit and i39ll prolly make them again tonight since i have so much leftover frosting and i colored the frosting orange to look like a pumpkin so if i don39t use it now i probably never will
these cupcakes came out very moist and delicious i only used 3 12 cups of confectioners sugar in the frosting recipe and a teaspoon of the cinnamon though next time i will use the full 2 teaspoons of cinnamon in the frosting next time
these are awesome i iced these as mummies for our school fair everyone loved them
i can39t get canned pumpkin how much cooked pumpkin is equal to this
took these to work this morning they didn39t even make it to 1st break all man environment they thought they were completely outstanding and want me to make more for tomorrow good stuff
delicious better than i expected
these pumpkin cupcakes are undeniable the best we have ever had a little 34heavy34 but very moist and the flavor is just perfect after reading comments about not getting the 34peak34 on the frosting i set my frosting bag in the fridge for about an hour before using and it harden up enough to create beautiful peaks i will definately be making these again and again
i made this as a bundt cake very moist and delicious a little too sweet for my taste with the frosting so will make it again without frosting and perhaps will cut down on sugar
i made a bundt cake instead of cupcakes it39s a very moist cake very yummy although very sweet it didn39t even need frosting but was yummy nevertheless i39m going to make it again but will use less sugar
this was a real hit with my family we will have this instead of pumpkin pie at thanksgiving
yummy moist tasty cupcakes i made 2 batchesone for us some to freeze and one for the potluck at church today everyone loved them and complemented on the spicy flavor and tasty cinnamon frosting i just spread the frosting on top it firms up after sitting for awhile so good i39ll make them again and again
this was delicious even though the frosting was a little liquidy it still had a great flavor the cupcake itself was great we39ll definitely make this again
i used a different frosting but the cupcakes are very moist and tasty
awesome
these cupcakes are great made these last year for the 1st time they were a bit hit will make them again this year enjoy
these cupcakes were a great hit got the recipe from my friends son when he posted it on his facebook page enjoygoing to make them again this year
these cupcakes were so easy and delicious perfect for fall
i would suggest trying a piping bag with a star tip if it seems too soft put in freezer for a few mins to harden it some and that may help hope this works for you
made these for a get together yesterday they were fabulous however sledchick my frosting was spreadable i couldn39t get it to peak either but still very delicious
i made these for a party i was hosting on a chilly fall evening and they were fantastic and a huge hit they turned out very moist and the flavor was wonderful i cut the frosting recipe in half and am glad i did because this was plenty i tried them with and without the frosting and liked them both ways the frosting is not necessary but really does make them just a little more special they went well with the spiced hot apple cider i served and i will make these again
i have made these twice and they are a huge hit easy to make and delicious they will make your kitchen smell yummy
these are amazing a hit at my work for our potluck but one questionhave made these a few times but never have been able to peak the frosting is the picture with canned frosting anyone else have this problemeither way the frosting is still amazing its just spread on there
my kids loved this my 4 year old wasn39t so sure when i put the canned pumpkin in but loved it in the end everyone said they were good
made this in the fall and took them to work everyone raved over them very moist and delicious
these are so moist and tasty and pretty too i make these whenever i have guests over during the fall season
excellent i have also found that when pumplin is not available candied yams work just as great
very moist and not overly sweet
these are great and very delicious i used only 2 cups of sugar in the frosting and it was not too sweet but just right i made thse for my husband39s potluck for work and got an amazing 48 cupcakes from this recipe awesome i will make these again for thanksgiving instead of my pumpkin roll
this recipe is delicious everyone in the office loved them i made everything per the directions except for the icing i didn39t want an overwhelming cinnamon flavor so i only used 12 tsp of cinnamon and it came out perfectly i39m very pleased with the recipe and yes i also had extra batter and icing i just used a 534 round and made a small cake
i have substitutedexchanged sweet potato and pumpkin in many sweet recipes a quicker and just as tasty version of this recipe would be to use an equal amount of sweet potato and instead of a cream cheese frosting remove cupcakes about 3 minutes early place a large marshmallow on top and return to the oven for the remaining time or until the marshmallows are slightly melted but still fluffy
i made these cupcakes as one of four selections for my daughters wedding and now everyone is asking for the recipe i got more compliments on this recipe than any of the others flavors they really are super delicious and i am not really a fan of pumpkin i did use my own cream cheese frosting recipe though i will definetly make again and again
this was really good even though i cheated and used canned frosting i had extra batter too
this is excellent and super easy to make if you do make a double batch ie 48 cupcakes don39t bother doubling the icing there is way too much left over as it is
loved this recipe i used fresh pumpkin that i cooked i added chocolate chips which my husband loved
this was by far the best cupcake i have ever made it turned out absolutely perfect and the cinnamon in the frosting was an excellent touch i made them for my son39s birthday and they were a huge hit
just made these yesterday my daughter and i ate one right out of the oven and they tasted like a slice of pumpkin pie i did add the frosting and cut it in half per peoples suggestion and it was perfect they made exactly 24 cupcakes i used my pampered chef cookie scoop medium one and it worked really well because the batter is kind ofpuffy or frothy sooo yummy my hubby thought the frosting was a little too overpowering he couldn39t tell they were pumpkin cupcakes till i told him but still loved them
very seldom do i cupcakes but these sounded so good so i made them for a catering job i had i have never recieved so many compliments on a recipe than i did for these cupcakes i have a feeling they will be requested often great recipe
this is really great my family loves them they39re great with or without the frosting maybe i39ll add raisens next time and skip the frosting the only thing that really needs to change on this recipe is the amount of frostingway too muchi39ll cut the amount in half next time
omgosh this is a killer cupcake recipe absolutely love it i won39t make any other pumpkin flavored cupcake now this one is too good and the frosting is dlish the cinnamon really adds something special you have to try this recipe
great recipe my husband always asks for these i only make half the frosting and it is always more than enough
this turned out beautifully the frosting is a wonderful compliment to the full flavored cupcake
nice
these are so yummy i made them for my 4 year old39s halloween party not such a tough crowd and they were all gone within the hour
my six year old son made these cupcakes for a potluck and they were a hit everyone was asking him for the recipe
this recipe was alright i didn39t add the cinnamon to the frosting and everyone loved the frosting i will probably make the frosting again
my friends and my husband39s coworkers loved these i39m definitely taking them to the inlaws39 for thanksgiving
5 stars for the cupcakes but i added more cinnamon the frosting was to me sickening sweet way too much sugar for mebut that39s my taste
delisheverybody loved them
i made this for 34girls night out34 and everyone loved them
first time making these cupcakes and they came out great everyone at worked loved them followed recipe exactly and it does truly make 24 cupcakes the frosting was wonderful to die for in fact i kept a few cupcakes without the frosting and they were equally as good
very moist and rich a little heavyas mine did not raise well they seem to spread out over the top of the muffin tin i would use non stick spray on the top before i put my cupcake liners in i also put frosting in ziploc bag snipped corner and squeezed out the frosting on each cupcake this cut my frosting time in half
a keeper these were so moist i made exactly as directed with no substitutions and they were perfect sprinkled ground pecans on topddddlish
yes i substituted milk and lemon juice also for the buttermilk some collapsed and some didn39t don39t know why they still were a hit
fabulous high in fat though took it to a party nods of approval everywhere
i made these cupcakes yesterday and used fresh pumpkin that i had just baked and pureed i used the same amount as a can of pumpkin they turned out great nice and moist i used buttercream frosting and added cinnamon to the icing will definitely make again
reviewed nov 23 by birdladythey were great went over well at our church thanksgiving dinner i sprinkled toasted pecans on top of the frosting which gave them a little crunch and special taste
these were delicious i made them for my belgian friend and she loved them it was here first ever cupcake and it was a huge hit they are super moist and i used the leftover icing on warmed banana nut bread wow
excellent i grated fresh nutmeg on the top of the cupcakes beautiful and delicious
this was absolutely delish my whole family loved them even the kids i made it a second time as a cake takes at least twice the baking time as the cupcakes well worth the wait just wonderful it is not complicated very easy to make
haven39t made the recipe yet we have a christmas bazaar this weekend coming up and i39ll make some regular size ones to sell and mini ones for the luncheon table should sell out i love pumpkin anything
absolutely delish my 5yr old daughter just loved them too i plan on using the frosting recipe for my next batch of cinnamon rolls
i will make into a cake next timedelicious
too much icing left over could i use the already made cream cheese frosting in the tub
great recipelast reviewer states it only makes 36 not 48 cupcakeslook at the recipe specs again it states the recipe makes 24 cupcakesi used an ice cream scoop to fill my tins 34 full and got 24 extremely large cupcakes
won the office potluck with this great recipe i think next time i39ll add more cinnamon to the frosting i also suggest that you keep the frosting room temprature until you39re sure you39re finished with it as it39s super sticky and very hard to work with cold
these are really good i took they to work for our halloween party and everyone wanted the recipe maybe i didn39t fill the cups as much as recommended because it made more than 2 dozen
yumthanks for posting
i am a secretary for an elementary school and i made a batch of these cupcakes to share with the staff at schoolthey were a big hit and i had several requests for the recipe i will definately make these cupcakes again
these cupcakes are delicious i will make them again for sure i followed the recipe exactly and it made 24 large not jumbo cupcakes as well as 16 mini cupcakes i also think they would make cute mini loaves
these were amazing i didn39t have ginger but substituted nutmeg they still were fabulous can39t wait to make more
these cupcakes are easy to make and have a wonderful flavor the cream cheese frosting with added cinnamon is a hit and i will be using it for other cakes like carrot cake the cupcakes tend to collapse and become flat topped instead of the usual cupcake shape however the shape doesn39t detract from the flavor my family loved them
wow very easy and delicious they don39t last long will definitely be making again
ok i substituted the buttermilk with milk and a tablespoon of lemon juice as directed in the tohcookbooks but the muffins didn39t puff up as they should and collapsed somewhat at the end when still in the oven very strange perhaps substituting buttermilk was not such a good idea the taste however was ok
everybody had to take two because they were so delicious
this is a great recipe but it only made 36 cupcakes not 48 if i made them again i would cut the frosting recipe in halfway too much left over
my family loved these cupcakes i didn39t even get a chance to frost them the recipe is easy the results are great
these are so easy and came out great i made them in my wilton leafpumpkin pans and they are just so cute and taste wonderful i think they are the best cupcakes ive made yet knightstown in
lord hammercy this pie was a back breaker for me i had to keep thinning out the mixture with more chicken broth than anticipated but i finally got there thanks for a very tasty pie this recipe rocks will def make again
this is one tasty pot pie recipe it39s definitely a keeper in my household i believe in trying a recipe as written first and making adjustments later if needed so that39s what i did many have said it39s very thick as written and i have to agree it tasted great but was overly thick for my liking the second time around i used a 12 cup of flour and for me that was the perfect amount
this is my favorite pot pie recipe the only thing i change is the frozen veg weird i prefer canned but tonight i still have fresh corn so i will use that but the best recipe seriously
by far the best chicken pot pie i have ever made while i followed recipe exactly as written i did find i had to add a bit more milk delicious
i dont like corn and peas so i upped the other vegetables and added celery i also sautéed my chicken with thyme and rosemary as well as added a tsp of rosemary to the filling pies came out amazing i froze mine first and used them later following the tips at the bottom
i made it exactly as written and it is so very good i can39t imagine a better recipe though this is the first homemade pot pie i39ve made the comments about it being too thick to me are very unfounded i thought at first it was awfully thick but the end result was perfection in my opinion i would not have wanted it any thinner it would have been a mess this slices well and mmmmmm good you won39t want to lose this recipe
this was the first and only recipe that i39ve used for chicken pot pie and absolutely love it it was extremely easy to follow the recipe and my entire family devours it every time i subbed the milk out for almond milk and it was delicious i thinned the mixture a little bit with some extra milk and chicken broth and the mixture turned out to have a really nice consistency
i39ve made this many times this last time i made it i bagged the extra filling and stuck it in the fridgeits been 3 days now i39m wondering if uts still good to stick in a pie crust amp bake aurthor if your seeing this i really gotta know
best chicken pot pie recipe make your own crusts or buy them but you will get four pies if you follow the recipe which is even better freeze em buy the deep dish ones too
this is at least the 4th time i have made this i use half the butter and just a little over half the flour i add a pound of mushrooms cooked down so as not to add liquid i use shallots instead of onion i then throw in a bunch of garlic parsley basil a little marjoram no thyme since it is just the two of us i bake both and after they have chilled i cut them into dinner slices wrap them individually and freeze them stunningly delicious pot pie
this chicken pot pie recipe is really good i got 2 pies out of it and had plenty of leftovers my family loved it will definitely make this again
every year i make this with thanksgiving leftovers and every year i am so glad i did i usually get 34 pies out of this recipe depending on the size i make and they freeze beautifully i love always having one on hand for a night i feel like cooking and can just pop one in the oven for a few hours and walk away
this had great flavor but the mixture was too thick it was like pasty gravy may be just a personal preference that i like it more creamy therefore i will definitely use less butter and flour next time
made this for dinner tonight and the 34gravy34 was super thick i wish i had stuck to my instincts and put about half the flour in it or maybe used cornstarch instead also with adding the milk it39s more like a cream gravy and i prefer a rich traditional chicken gravy not terrible but won39t be a keeper for our house
this recipe is wonderful i39ve made it as written several times with homemade crust it makes enough filling as written for 2 deep dish 9 inch pies or 3ish normal pie pans if you do 2 normal pie pans they will be overflowing and quite saucy my additions after tasting as written are to add a teaspoon of garlic and 12 teaspoon of rosemary and sage easy shortcut if you39re in a hurry is to replace the carrotpeascarrots with mixed frozen veggies this is my son39s favorite meal so i just quadrupled the recipe with great success you39ll need multiple pots if you do
i have made this pot pie for several years my father in law loves it thank you for a delicious addition to family traditions
made this per recipe but omitted the onions and used my homemade pie crust it was very good and have lots of sauce which some potpies do not have
this was a really great recipe so many recipes online these days are fails but this worked perfectly for our family39s preference i used 12 cup butter instead of 1 cup the recipe still worked just fine with half the butter we also prefer a bit more seasoning so i added a teaspoon of my poultry seasoning and some ground cayenne pepper and snuck in a handful of julienned kale for a little extra nutrition i39m sure the seasoning in the recipe would be just fine as is though for most families the amount of filling this makes is plentiful easily enough for two deep dish pie plates but one could probably even do 3 shallow pie dishes i baked one pie and put the other in the freezer for another night my family loved this recipe thank you for a reliable recipe that we will use again and again
excellent recipe easy to follow delicious i like to sometimes add some bacon son loves it
this is easily the most delicious chicken pot pie i have made there is a ton of filling roughly 4 12 cups per pie for a total of 9 cups of filling i only had 1 large pie pan so i divided the filling in half with a 4 12 cup measure i will make the other when the dish is clean and freeze it then my house smells heavenly
easy delicious recipe loved the pie and making it
i have been making this chicken pot pie recipe for years now i usually give the second one away i39ve gotten so many compliments from this recipe it is everyone39s favorite so scrumptious and delicious
great recipelove the whole recipeone correctionit made 4 9 inch pies so either half the recipe or make sure you have a lot of freezer space or friends to give them toolol
i have been making this for the past three years and we love it the only thing i did not add was the thyme since my husband and i a fan of it love the fact that i bake one and freeze one each time i make this recipe
this is such an amazing recipe thank you so much
a cup of butter and a cup of flour to make the roux for the gravy preposterous i fell for it and ended up throwing out most of the flourbutter mess it39s impossible that other people followed the recipe and gave it any stars at all i was able to salvage what i had and it ened up quite good however just beware of that cup of butter and cup of flour is that a typo or what
the best recipe found i used a deep dish pie pan and it came out beautifully will definitely make many times shared a photo of it with my daughter who asked me to make her one this weekend
definitely a winter 34go to34 favorite for my house i added a splash of white wine to the final mixture so yummy
delicious made this tonight and did not make any changes will be making again loved it
i used unsweetened almond milk to make it dairy free and bob39s red mill gf flour and it turned out greati also threw in a couple cups of chopped fresh baby spinach
made this for the first time tonight and it was bomb i made some alterations because my family doesn39t like english peas instead i stirred in leftover fresh spinach for color and it was all kinds of wonderful make sure you use both dark meat and white meat
first time making chicken pot pie this recipe yielded 3z i used a rotisserie chicken and biscuits on top it was fantastic froze one
been making this for a couple of years this is the best eaten i double the recipe to share with my family i am so glad i found this recipeyou will want to save this i promise
made this today and was very pleased i left out the onions and corn i diced the carrots and potatoes used one can of libby green peas i used three chicken breasts and two thighs and boiled them so i had some real chicken broth for the milk i used evaporated milk one cup milk 12 cup water i didn39t use a bottom crust for the top crust i used a storebought pie crust and rolled it out thinner to fit a 9x12 oblong pan husband bragged on it without any prodding i only used half the filling so i plan to make another to share with someone tomorrow i really like the fact that it makes two pot pies will be making this again
haven39t made this yet concerned about the bottom crust being soggy without blind baking it first haven39t read that anyone did this was your bottom crust soggy
best chicken pot pie i39ve ever eaten omg i roasted two large chicken breasts beforehand and steamed whole red potatoes then peeled and diced afterward i also used a package of frozen peas and carrots makes a supercreamy pot pie enough for 2 pies be sure to vent your pies on top they need to let out steam mine cracked on top but who cares it was fantastic
absolutely delicious easy tasty and filling
never made a chicken pot pie before and i am so glad i chose this recipe yum i roasted a whole chicken in the morning and diced it up which i will definitely do again for this such good flavor i froze one of the pot pies wait to see how it turns out
this was amazing delicious great for a cold winters day highly recommend i used little purple potatoes which gave it a little more color
made this recipe at least 4 times and my family loves it hearty and has incredible flavor used all dark meat chicken or a mix of white and dark and both are great foolproof
this is so good even my husband loved it amp he usually does not like chicken dishes love that you can cook 2 pies amp freeze one for later amp the reheated frozen pie tastes just as delicious as the freshly made pie
i made this potpie today and loved it i put have of the filling in a freezer bag for the next time i have a taste for chicken potpie this is a keeper
i halved this recipe to make one perfect pie i used chicken stock to cook my chicken breasts then reused to cook carrots and potatoes used 2 milk and light butter very delicious
excellent i don39t usually use recipes when i cook but this is a keeper will definitely make again
this is how mom used to make pot pie always great
excellent recipe i altered the veggies that i used but followed the rest of the recipe the creamy roux in this thing is on point so delicious i make one pie using the creamy mixture and then freeze the creamy mixture for a future pie it39s perfect love it
my neighbor brought this over after i got out of the hospital tues night i bugged her for the recipe right away i don39t know what about this recipe that makes it so great but it is the best pot pie i ever tasted it must be the thyme butter and chicken broth really fantastic and will be baking it for myself after my hip heals
great recipe i followed all the directions but i smoked a whole chicken on my yoder stick burner smoker that added a wonderful smoky savory flavor especially after putting an herby rib on it definitely do it again
this was the best pot pie ever made i halved the recipe used frozen mixed vegetables my only change will be to cube the chicken into bigger pieces next time
great recipe and an easy one whenever i have left over roasted chicken i make this dish i dice the carrots instead of slice and don39t add the corn other than that follow recipe exactly perfect consistency to the sauce
love this recipe i left out the corn and only used a top crust wonderful recipe for a quick dinner since i quite often boil chicken dice and freeze it and the broth
this was the best pot pie that i have ever eaten i halved the recipe so that i made one pie just for my husband and me it is one that i will make again and will share with others how good it was i moved it to a lower rack the last 5 minutes to make sure the bottom crust was well done again one of the best ever chopped half a large onion i peeleddiced and boiled 2 potatoes used 23 cup frozen corn and 12 cup peas and 34 cup canned carrots drained the ones that needed to have liquid removed boiled 2 ck breast and shredded them the sauce was half of the regular as given and had great flavor and thickened well had a little extra filling left over so i made a very small one with just crust on top yummy i see that another reviewer said they made the full recipe and froze half of the filling for another time good idea also
good recipe
i made this for thanksgiving dinner for two we had already had turkey with the family the week before so we were looking for an alternative meal we loved it i only needed one pot pie for the two of us and don39t have freezer room for a whole pie so i put the extra filling in a freezer bag for future use
my mother in law made this for my husband and i to save for when i had my son a quick meal to heat up since then i have made this 4x this is a great recipe the only thing i changed based on personal preference i added 3 cloves of garlic and fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden i also only used 1 stick of butter great recipe will continue to make
i add canned diced potatoes to mine so good everyone that has tried it is obsessed
awesome followed the directions to the letter and was very satisfied with the end product thanks for sharing this recipe
this recipe was exactly what i was looking forrich thick gravy and delicious i don39t care for pie crust so i used one puff pastry and cut the recipe in half now i wish i had made the whole thing as it was so good i omitted the corn but added celery everything else i include i used canned chicken and used the broth from the cans for the gravy i used a smaller rectangle dish than a 9 x13 it was 8 x 115 so good i froze the leftovers and even took a serving over to my neighbor who lives alone she liked it too
made it yesterday very tasty excellent recipe
this was the best chicken pot pie i39ve ever made and is so much better than the store bought ones it39s classic and perfectly creamymy boyfriend rates every recipe i try and this one he gave 1110 and i agree i made some minor edjustments i used the 3 cups of chicken stock to boil the carrots and potatoes and reserved the liquid to add back in later i only added 34 cup of flour instead of 1 cup and i added 2 stalks of chopped celery when i added the onion to the pan i made 1 pie last nightand froze the filling for a future pie i can truly say i will never buy a store bought chicken pie again
this was so good its quite time consuming but well worth it this recipe makes way to much for just my husband and i so i just made one nine inch pie with my own pie crust and will freeze the rest of the filling in food saver bags i am going to put filling over noodles next time hope it stands up to the freezer for a couple weeks
added red and green bell pepper and broccoli florets and extra chicken broth to the gravy cut the recipe in half and still got two 9 inch pies very good and freezing one of the pies for use as another easy dinner
i actually made this for my son amp daughterinlaw who just had a new baby so was making some easy meals for them i made an extra for us it was so quick amp easy to make i thought that it was delicious amp probably the best chicken pot pie that i39ve ever had my husband said 34i don39t know what you did but 34it was better than any other i39ve ever eaten34 i will definitely make this again amp freeze a few as well
wonderful recipe we found out that we do not like thyme so my daughter uses rosemary instead such a delicious perfect recipe she also makes her own pie crust which makes it even better she makes 12 the portions because otherwise it39s too much for just 1 pie unless is a bigger deeper pie dish
this is a family favorite i39ve made it multiple times and it39s a hit every time it39s easy to make which is my favorite kind of recipe because i really don39t like to cook lol with ease in mind i typically use frozen mixed veggies and frozen onions if i don39t have potatoes at hand i increase the chicken and veggies to make up the volume i will cook one and freeze the other for another day great recipe
absolutely the best chicken pot pie recipe i made a few minor adjustments based on ingredients i had at home throwing out my old recipe this is the meow
loved this pie i made half a recipe more or less in a pie plate with my favorite crust recipe i have thyme so i used poultry seasoning the corn was canned because what i had and the carrots were leftover roasted no peas since hubs really stand them so i threw in some leftover green beans instead and i used a combination of skim milk and halfamphalf because again what i had pandemic baking as another reviewer noted but it was creamy and delicious and next time i will make extra and freeze yum
great recipe i made some adjustments for our family i added 1 12 teaspoons of garlic powder i also increased the seasonings to reflect the following dried thyme to 2 teaspoons 1 12 teaspoons of pepper and 1 12 teaspoons of salt i also swapped the milk for half and half it was perfect that way for our families tastebuds
was craving comfort food and this was everything i hoped for easy to follow instructions was a big hit with my husband
delicious i made a few adjustments i substituted whole milk with oat milk i used pearl onions instead of chopped onion i added onion powder and garlic powder to the seasonings i added broccoli when boiling potatoes and carrots i added mushrooms when adding peas and corn i seasoned my chicken when cooking it with same seasoning as i put in this pie i half baked the bottom pastry before adding filling and top layer of pastry to ensure it wasn39t under cooked i use a square glass baking dish rubbed with a generous coating of butter i would love to try it with turkey breast
delicious i will definitely make it again
this was sooo good will make it again
i have been making this recipe for years it has become a family favorite i usually make little individual pies to freeze with the extra filling it is my go to to bring to friends after surgery or tragic loss
delicious i added seasoned salt poppyseeds a bay leaf and diced celery
i made some adjustments firstly i cut the recipe in half i cooked the potatoes and carrots in three cups water three cubes of chicken bouillon stained the broth to use it in the roux i used three cups of chicken broth 34 cups 2 milk and between 1223 cups heavy cream the sauce was perfect with the extra liquid my husband and i absolutely loved it
delicious even the picky eaters gobbled it down
i love this recipe i make a vegetarian dairy free version of this pot pie 45 times a year i sub the dairy for almond milk and vegan butter then use more veggies and vegetable broth instead of chicken always a crowd favourite even meat eaters and kids
delicious nice blend of chicken and vegetables a keeper for sure
corrected review a half cup of flour per pie was too much it came out too gluey and dense i started over used a little less than a 14 cup per pie and it turned out good thick enough to hold everything together but still creamy
this was delicious i added garlic because i love garlic but it was so wonderful the base sauce was so creamy i used low fat milk but was still deliciousness i also added better then chicken bouillon in with the chicken stock step for more flavor
i make a lot of recipes off the internet and i usually don39t post reviews but i39m sitting here eating some chicken pot pie and i39m wondering why in the cussword i39ve never made this before this is absolutely delicious and i think if i didn39t have more self control i39d eat the whole thing right now make this pie if you don39t like thyme then reduce it39s got a lot of thyme but it39s fantastic
this is a perfect recipe i was glad it made 2 pies i was making one for a friend and another to keep we had ours last night and it was exactly what i hoped it would be ultimate comfort food our very picky 5 year old loved it he asked for seconds i swapped the dried thyme out for 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme because i love using fresh herbs i boiled my potatoescarrots in chicken broth then used the same broth to boil the cubes chicken meat breast and used the same broth for the gravy i imagine using a rotisserie chicken would make this even easier i also did a light egg wash on the crust for color i will be saving this recipe as my new goto for pot pie
i love this recipe i first came upon it 13 years ago when i was making freezer meals in preparation for our second daughter on the way and wanted to have meals ready in the freezer i39ve made it over and over ever since it is the ultimate comfort food and i love that it makes 2 pies
best chicken pot pie recipe i have found my family loves it
this recipe is a keeper i highly recommend this best i have made and will keep this recipe when making in the future i read other reviews and agree the base sauce is excellent so easy to make with simple ingredients i made the chicken in a slow cooker and cooked with vegetable stock for flavor when done i shredded taste was great i did the potatoes but left out the corn and peas as i have i added celery when cooking the onions for a bit of texture instead of pie crust i made buttermilk biscuits and put on the top using a small roasting pan allowed to have biscuits for all and it covers the pan nicely try this you will like it and so will the family
having never made a chicken pot pie before in my life i was thrilled with how easy this recipe was to make and how delicious it turned out we halved the recipe to make just one pie the nice thing this was a forgiving recipe we had slightly less chicken then called for but slightly more potatoes and didn39t have any onions because that39s pandemic cooking so just used some onion powder for flavor really as long as you fill the pie and have the right amount of the gravy mix it39s okay to have some variation on the fillings and will still turn out great will absolutely make this again and again
i have made chicken and other pot pies for 30 years this is by far my favorite base recipe i can never make a recipe without some augmentation to make it my own mishpachahlike family my bubbe would say i omitted the milk i used a cup of homemade milk free gravy i had left from the meal for which i made the roast chicken we were using leftovers for this pie i recently discovered if done right no milk is needed and creaminess survives i also added an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the fluid in addition i added a tbs of dried parsley and substituted diced yams for the white potatoes i made a homemade simple crust ice water butter flour and salt and brushed the top with yolkwater combo and sprinkled with a few pinches of dries thyme the cooking time was spot on even here at high elevation in colorado i only wish you could see the photos and taste the creamy hearty comforting goodness i froze the second pot pie filling on it39s own to be put in a fresh crust another time during this pandemic freezer space is at a premium my new go to pot pie recipe mazel tov to taste of home
best pot pie recipe i have ever found made this last night for sunday family dinner and everyone raved about it one pie fed 7 adults and 2 small children only changes i made to recipe were omitting the thyme picky kids and adding 12 cup half and half in with milk delicious will make this again and again
my go to pot pie recipe this is absolutely delicious i always make this for company and get rave reviews
absolutely delicious comfort food and well worth the time i added celery to the onion carrot saute and 2 bay leaves to the cream sauce while it simmered but then removed them i used half for a 2 crust pot pie and froze it it cooked up great 3 weeks later the other half of the chicken mix i baked in a 2 qt pirex baker uncovered st for 35 min while i made homemade waffle batter reduced the sugar and typical spices adding a pinch of poultry spice instead my family went wild over the waffles topped with the bubbling and rich hot chicken veggie gravy a total hit and kept the pot pie 3 weeks later seeming like a whole new dish winner winner 2 chicken dinners
i have been working on adjusting a similar recipe for years and for my tribe here are the only changes i make on the 15 cups of milk make half of this liquid whole milk and the other half and half or if you have heavy whipping creme us it this makes a huge difference and might create the need to cut back on flour as this gets really thick fast next is while the sauce is simmering throw in two slices of american or velveeta cheese last but not least is two to three cloves of garlic pressed put this in during sauce thickening i sent this home with my daughter and her husband ate almost a full half pie at a sitting he is skinny as a rail and eats like a bird but he said this was one of the best dishes he has ever had he would not say that for fun it39s goooouooood also i substitute shrimp for the chicken some times and make shrimp pot pie ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm gary
deliscous will make again and again
easy and it was the best
this is a go to recipe for me i always multiply the recipe because so easy to freeze just the thing when you want to bring a comfort food dinner to folks the frozen version tastes just as good and it times substituted ingredients with good results
my entire family loved this even my picky 4 year old i did not have corn which was a bummer but pie still full of veggies i used a large pyrex and used pizza dough rather than pie dough on top only delish also i always leave out thyme as i think it is too strong
i would use the potato and carrot water and less flour and milk the starch from the water will help to thicken the sauce and add flavor
this recipe is superior to any others i have tried it has now become a regular home comfortfood for our large familyso delish we prefer just one crust on the top so i just put the filling into a casserole dishdishes and top with crust then bake
this far exceeded my expectations which were already high because this site has never let me down it makes so much that i actually made three pies with it i added basil and mushrooms frozen pies are excellent for new parents i brought one to a couple recently and it was a huge hit definitely file this one away as a keeper
had no issue with flour as others have had it was the perfect consistency very tasty teenage daughter said it was 34the bomb34the prep work took a lot longer than 40 min as recipe stated
this was very goodi cut back some on flour
i only used 13 cup of flour the second time i made this it was delicious both times but we like the filling a bit thinner definitely a new favorite in our house
made this last night was the best didn39t have thyme so used basil and it was perfect
what kind of potatoes
really satisfied my craving for chicken pot pie and is easy to make
the best i make my own crust and that is the only change i make
my husband said this potpie was the best i39ve ever made i added celery with the onions and boiled carrots and potatoes in chicken broth then used the broth to make the sauce topped with tater tots instead of crust
halved recipe added 14 tsp of poultry seasoning and used tater tots instead of pie crust in the oven now and it smells really good we wait to eat it
best potpie i39ve ever had hands down subs i39ve made in the past include using rabbit in place of chicken and subbing cauliflower in for the potatoes i39ll be making this one for a long time
to be brutally honest this is very close to the chicken pot pie recipe found in the older versions of betty crocker cookbooks which is the best recipe i39ve ever tasted while homemade crust is better in my opinion it39s also far more time consuming this is a quick and easy recipe and the filling is right on the money if somehow you come out with a bland meal after using a full cup of butter you39re doing something wrong
where do the potatoes in the directions come from
i love this recipe i use this recipe at home and at my job
this is the only chicken pot pie recipe i make the flavors are welldeveloped and it is pretty easy to make i generally use a rotisserie chicken for the 4 cups of chicken i get requests for this pot pie quite often it39s definitely a favorite in my family
we simply love this recipe i cook it as written and find it is just right i make 2 pies so we can share with my sister39s family i have never found it pasty or gummy and have made it numerous times
i love this recipe i cook it exactly as it reads and it turns out perfect everytime there is no other pot pie that can compare to this one and the thyme is crutial for delivering taste a forever keeper for the whole family to enjoy
my family loves this pot pie recipe make it often sometimes with frozen crust and sometimes with fresh made pie crust always a hit a definite keeper and thanks for sharing
absolutely best chicken pot pie husband not a thyme lover so substituted sage and summer savory liked thickness of sauce i only made 1 pie and saved half of filling for another day will definitely make again maybe even try in individual pies thank you
great i add more chicken a tbsp of chicken soup base paste and then omit the regular salt
everyone loves this all 4 of my boys and husband devour these pies we39ve often had guests over and they have always raved about it
sounds easy
i am surprised that no one took exception to the cup of butt
horrible recipe the sauce was a stark white tasteless paste that no amount of 34doctoring34 after the fact could resolve a total waste of ingredients and home made pie crust a much better option is to make your chicken stock or use storebought stock and thicken it using 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 14 cup cold water and simmer until it thickens before adding the chicken and vegetables that way you still have chicken gravy not flour gravy
my husband and i agree that the best chicken pie recipe tried but i agree with sfcollins about reducing the flour a bit thank you for sharing this recipe bw
not sure how this received so many positive comments i made recipe as written and it resulted in a very thick and gummy sauce it is far too much flour in this recipe if i make it again i39ll cut flour in half
i thought this was very good the only issue i have is the amount of thyme listed in the recipe i even use 1 full tsp and it was still very overpowering next time use 14 tsp if any at all i also made it in a 10x13 baking dish instead of two round pies which worked very well would definitely recommend just use less thyme
i freeze the filling and pull out two ready made pie crusts right before baking one deep dish and one regular yum
i freeze the filling and pull out two ready made pie crusts right before baking one deep dish and one regular yum
i39m totally confused by everyone who loved this recipe i halved it because i was making one pie i found the 12 cup of flour way too much for thickening i had to thin it using additional milk and broth which threw me off i then needed additional salt and pepper when i realized how thick my sauce was i looked at other recipes for the amount of liquid i used 13 cup of flour is appropriate i39m certain i measured correctly my flour was all purpose it was fine after the adjustment
absolutely amazing i made crust from scratch because i didn39t have store bought on hand and i39m excited to see how much easier it is with a rotisserie chicken and packaged pie crust my son is allergic to dairy so i used earth balance 34buttery34 spread sticks instead of butter and unsweetened original plant milk instead of whole milk and the whole family chowed down like it was their last meal on earth
it39s perfect there39s no a thing i39d change
such a wonderfully comforting and delicious filling i used my own butterbased pie crust recipe and made the filling as per the directions great comfort food my husband said it was the best chicken pot pie ever had
this was really good the only thing i did different was instead of adding the carrots i used frozen peas and carrots next time i might try adding mushrooms though it39s good without them too i39ll make it again for sure
excellent as written i love that this contains no canned soupsthough i do use them for convenience sometimes i used rotisserie chicken for this love the tip about the slumped crust i learned something new lynne volunteer field editor
this was amazing my guys loved it and told me not to change anything
the note at the bottom says to let the fluted crust rest in the fridge i take it to mean that you are putting the whole pie in the fridge
making this for the second time tonight i use king arthur flours chicken pot pie crust recipe along with this recipe and the results are simply fantastic substituted onion salt heavy cream and celery and mushrooms no potatoes also used 4 bouillon cubes just awesome
best ever pot pie we added garlic to the onions and rosemary and parley to the spices moisture and texture were a concern but it was perfect we all loved it
awesome flavor and relatively easy to make i added 2 stalks of celery and omitted the boiling of the carrots and potatoes as i had diced them fairly small when i make again i will boil the carrots and celery as they were still a little crunchy but red potatoes were perfect as is as a personal preference the gravy made with the flour was a bit too thick and i think i would cut the flour in half next time to make it a little easier to fill in the gaps for the pie
this recipe is probably one of the best pot pie recipes eaten very filling
thank you regi m for your review so glad you took the time to give such helpful information and share the knowledge that you have acquired from your experience
i am a young senior and a well seasoned cook and baker pun intended i know there will be some who will start clucking under their breaths when i say i haven39t made this exact recipe but is is very close to one my mother who was a fabulous cook taught me years ago i read a lot of the reviews because there are so many and i want to make comments based on what i read and my level of experience because there are so many who commented on there being too much thyme in this recipe i would suggest that if you do not use thyme regularly that you add the amount suggested in increments if you39re not use to more heavily spiced foods start off with a quarter of a teaspoon then sample it not enough add another quarter of a teaspoon and sample it again if you like that amount you don39t need to add the full teaspoon flavours become more pronounced as they cook and have time to combine with other ingredients spicing is a very personal thing and so you should always try a bit if you are concerned there is too much of anything you will not get zapped by lightening if you adjust the seasonings to your own personal preferences and it does not mean the recipe is not great the person who submitted the recipe likes the seasoning based on her family39s taste buds but it doesn39t mean it can39t be adjusted to your own the same goes for any other recipe have some teaspoons ready to sample recipes as you go personalize to your heart39s content it really irritates me when people comment about throwing food out because they don39t know how to make it more palatable i do have to remind myself though that not everyone had a mother like mine or had home economics classes in high school though they didn39t teach me much i hadn39t learned at home cooking and baking can be so much fun and life is too short to get so caught up on minor issues remember add a pinch or so sample and add more till it is to your taste baking has to be a more precise exercise because there has to be an exact ratio of rising agent as an example to other dry ingredients and liquids used again flavouring is a very personal matter i would like to thank karen johnson for submitting this recipe that makes this potpie from scratch with no condensed soup and artificial flavours to quote from a book called siddhartha by herman hesse i read in my early 2039s 34knowledge is communicable wisdom is not34 one of my mom39s favourites 34 we get too soon old and too late smart34
best pot pie recipe i39ve ever found we don39t care for thyme so left that out and still wonderful
this is the quintessential pot pie the flavors are spot on this was exactly what i was looking for thank you
yummyyou do not need to look for another pot pie recipethis is it
i was really excited about this but after spending much time on it i was disappointed as it seemed bland except for the fact that there was way too much of a thyme taste next time i39ll cut the thyme and add other seasonings
so my fiance and i are both pretty indifferent to chicken pot pie but i found myself browsing recipes in order to use some extra chicken i had before it went bad i found this recipe and decided to give it a try upon eating one bite he says 34this has to go into the rotation34 we both then devoured the tastiest chicken pot pie ever created i did do a few things differently i seared 5 chicken breast strips in vegetable oil that i coated in garlic powder salt pepper and italian seasoning i was out of thyme and thought the italian seasoning might add the missing flavor to the dish i used one whole can of drained carrotts and half the amount of the rest of the items the recipe called for after adding the cubed chicken i cooked prior the recipe was still enough for 2 pies i did not have 4 pie crusts so i used my largest round corningware casserole dish in place of a pie pan which provided room for the entire mixture it worked perfectly this is definitely in the rotation from now on
this is the best chicken potpie i have ever tasted this is a keeper thank you for the recipe
how do you print out this recipe see an option thanks
i followed the recipe but left out the potatoes dint want to over starch or whatever and no chicken as i dont eat it added steak seasoning and onion salt i used frozen veggies i used pork shoulder that i made a few days earlier it was delicious now if i had known pot pies were this easy i feel so silly buying them my store bought pie crust wasn39t any good so i had to improvise with pizza dough yummm
this is such a versatile and great recipe i double recipe and freeze extra in pans without crust put crust in a pan add filling and bake
i have been making this recipe for several years and it39s a favorite for everyone i39ve fed it to my kids in particular love it to save prep time i use 16 oz frozen diced potatoes and 16 oz frozen mixed veggies i also decreases the thyme to 12 tsp i do end up making 3 pies using these amounts lately my kids have decided they don39t like the crust as much so i only put crust on the top it39s definitely time consuming to make but having 2 spare in the freezer makes it worth it plus i love it so much the reheat from frozen instructions are spot on if you haven39t tried this you are missing out
i39ve used this recipe several times i love it i use it for turkey pot pies too and adjust the herbs it is an excellent way to use up roast turkey and freeze pies for later
okay did not have everything and needed something quicker but used as a starting point made half the recipe and wanted to reduce time by dicing up 1 cup of small new potatoes from a can for starters added about a cup of fresh mushrooms diced up along with onions to saute in butter substituted 12 oz package of mixed veggies for all other veggies will use more next time used overflowing 2 cups of rotisserie chicken along with 34jell34 from drippings in container mixed everything together along with 12 cup of sour cream and placed in 11x7 casserole dish and topped with parmesan cheese and then small cutouts from pie crust oh used thyme 34leaves34 and it was all wonderful i will definitely be making this again and probably in the very near future
made this for dinner tonightloved it will definitely be making this again thanks for the recipe
for those that had an overwhelming thyme taste use dried thyme leaves not ground thyme fresh thyme works best in my opinion especially if you can find lemon thyme it is easy to grow too best in 12x12 x12 inches deep pots and potting soil use started small plants rather than seeds so easy and cheaper in the long runi like to add the juice of one lemon in this as well the only way to make this even better is to have some homemade stock on hand i save and freeze all chicken bones in a bag in freezer
i really liked this pot pie it was delicious and it made 2 pies so i got to freeze one and have it the next week perfect if you are making dinner for another family who needs the help
this pot pie is amazing i tried the recipe without the thyme and added some onion salt and seasoning salt and it was absolutely delicious
the thyme overpowered the taste of this pie otherwise it should have been fine a lot of steps to have the one seasoning throw it off
this is so delicious there are a lot of steps but it is worth it
made this tonight it was awesome my husband loved it been making a pot pie for years that has cheese in it but this one takes the prize cut recipe in half and only made one tonight anxious to make again and try freezing one
made this tonight i love it i did follow the recipe but have a deep dish pie plate and made just one hanging onto this one for sure
this is a good solid recipe i39ve been wanting to make a pot pie for years my grandma used to make them but i dont have her recipe so just beginning to experiment it was 10 degrees and snowing so today was the dayi had to make it dairyfree so substituted the butter with bacon fat and just used a bit more broth and the liquid from the corn i used canned not frozen to replace the milk total abot 45 cups liquid next time i think i will try oat milk in place of the dairy milk all we had in the fridge was almond milk and i didn39t think that would work welli also cooked down some portobello 39shrooms about two cups before cooking in the pan first and added a cup or so of chopped celery along with the onions i pretty much followed all the other measurements oh added a bit of ground clove tooit was really great my two boys amp wife loved it it was gone in minutes i made just one pie only had one box of crusts in an extra deep 1034 stoneware pie pan and still have enough filling left over for probably another small pie but tomorrow is another snow day and i suspect the kids will warm it up and have it for breakfast that39s how they roll
made this on a cold winter39s night and it was a big hit the pan was wiped clean so needless to say it39s going in my recipe box
made this tonight absolutely delicious i usually make a recipe i got from the pioneer woman similar and good but this is really really good i did mine as instructed but instead of making 2 round pie plate pot pies i made one in my 9x13 stoneware dish and i only added 1 pie crust i have an 18 year old and my husband and big eaters so this way to serve for us worked greati highly recommend this recipe you be disappointed a keeper enjoy
any substitute for milk
great recipe i didn39t change anything except for i did make only one pie by using half of each ingredient
wish you would put how much of each ingredient to make only one pie would help on all recipies i think thank you
this is a fantastic recipe i make it just as written except i sub fatfree half and half for milk because of my family39s taste preferences i sometimes omit potatoes and use frozen carrotpea mix instead of fresh carrots i often add frozen green beans as well i use unsalted chicken stock to reduce sodium these taste perfectly fresh after several months in the freezer i wrap them in plastic wrap then put in a gallon ziplock to freeze def one of my top new recipes i39ve added this year the only problem is that it39s so good we eat too much
made this and it39s totally awesome tried freezing it and the sauce turned to water so it doesn39t freeze well but this is my new favorite the second time i made it i put in half the amount of potatoes and more chicken
i have made this several times and it39s a favorite hands down i put all the filling in one large pan instead of 2 pie plates made my own crust for a 2 crust pie and put it on top no bottom crust we don39t like thyme much so subbed out the thyme and subbed in poultry seasoning delicious
loved it so much i don39t love putting pies together so instead i rolled out my pie dough and cut into 334 squares which i baked individually we ladled the 34stew34 into bowls and topped with a piece of pie crust
question can i put the pies together and just not bake until tomorrow or will that make the bottom crust soggy i don39t really want to freeze them for just 24 hours
this is absolutely delicious comfort food at its best added four cups of potatoes but other than that followed recipe made 3 pot pies will definitely be making again
oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh myyyyyyyyyyy five stars are not enough to express how yummy this dish is this smelled heavenly and tasted even better we had roast chicken on sunday and i used the leftover meat and rich broth i cut the recipe in half since i only made one pie i didn39t have peas so substituted cut fresh asparagus for the 39green39 i also added garlic and bay leaves to the roux removed before pouring into pie shell it reminded me of one of those high end chicken pies from the freezer section but with less calories thanks for the recipe karen it will definitely be a regular on our table
love that the recipe makes two pies one to bake and one to freeze i did substitute rosemary for thyme it smelled heavenly while baking
love that the recipe makes two pies one to bake and one to freeze
this was soooo good made exactly to recipe easy and the whole family loved it the grandkids had seconds even definitely a keeper
first this is called baked chicken pie not pot pie pot pie has no crust my grandparents born in 1904 were pa dutch so i know this to be true it is amazing how many things you can do with this recipe even using sea food for the baked chicken pie my grandmother always added a few hard boiled eggs diced made the gravy silky and adds a extra punch she also made gravy on the side in the event someone wanted their39s extra moist you cannot make and freeze these if you use hard boiled eggs i make multiple small ones in the aluminum pans and freeze them they are great to pull out and heat when it39s snowing outside
yumm i made it exactly per the recipe minus the frozen corn because i didn39t have any but i39m not sure it needed it i may cut down on the thyme a bit next time and i did use low sodium chicken broth my husband says it39s 10 stars he says it39s the best meal i39ve cooked
this was very good i only used half of the thyme and made my own crust delicious i used low sodium broth and no added salt
this is a great recipe easy to make and tastes really really good i made no changes this time the next time it is made i will cut down on the thyme a bit too overpowering for me other than that spot on and delicious
so good really easy to prepare
does this recipe make 2 pies
i39ve prepared this several times and made some changes to it 34kicking it up a notch34 as ina would say first i use only fresh veggies except for the peas and pearl onions it adds time but fresh carrots parsnips and yukon golds make a difference next i add fresh mushrooms to the onion saute to keep this flavorful i roast chicken breasts that have been very well seasoned much better than rotisserie chicken and you can add the chicken juices to the stock upping the flavor considerably i also add a glug of sherry or white wine whichever is handy to the simmering sauce finally i use the tof site39s buttery flaky pie crust as the topper it doesn39t take long to make and i only let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes and is delicious on this pie yes i39ve increased the work and time but if you do this is likely the best pot pie that39s going to come out of your kitchen
i39ve made this recipe twice now both times as freezer meals for expecting mamas if you don39t like the way the filling tastes after you39ve added broth and milk add spices salt pepper sage garlic onion etc note this recipe makes a lot of filling so use a large saucepan with high sides to cook and have three pie shells ready just in case this recipe always turns into three pot pies for me
i don39t usually do the cooking baking as my husband is a much better cook he asked for chicken pot pie today i searched for recipes and thought this one looked good it was great directions easy to follow good flavor omitted the thyme and fresh carrot used frozen veggies instead he said it was the best meal i39ve ever made we both had seconds and will see how second pie that we froze turns out in a week or two highly recommend this recipe
it was delicious we added 1tbsp of worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp of garlic powder
no bland and dry yes i followed the recipe into the garbage after so much prep yes i39m irritated
this is a fantastic pot pie recipe i was really impressed with how well the frozen one baked up when i was ready to use it
made this today and my house smells so good gave one pot pie to my parents my dad just called to say how good it was waiting to put ours in the oven when hubby leaves work the filling is really good and was simple to make my only change was i used green beans instead of peas my dad hates peas and used top crust only will absolutely make this again
the chicken filling is the absolute best i have tried and will definitely make again as a personal preference though the only thing i would change is to only use crust on the top or top it off with puff pastry
wonderful recipe i served it for a ministry appreciation dinner all the guests loved it as did my very finicky son inlaw i did alter it just a little by adding 2 bay leaves removed before placing in casserole pie pans and 1 12 tsp poultry seasoning i did this primarily because i was using rotisserie chicken and wanted to make sure i had full bodied flavor this recipe is a keeper
this is the best chicken pot pie i have ever eaten i don39t usually write reviews but i had to join toh just to let everyone know that this recipe is amazing i followed the recipe exactly as written and everything is just delicious i wouldn39t change a thing the seasonings are just right and it has become a staple in my house my picky eaters love this and my husband said that this is his favorite meal thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe
excellent time consuming but so with it
i love all the fresh ingredients my kids love this it39s a good way to get some vegetables in them the seasonings are perfect i don39t change a thing
awesome recipemy husband and son loves chicken pot pie and i typically buy them fresh from a warehouse club been wanting to make a pot pie from scratch and found this recipe made it last night and hands down it was the best pot pie they have ever had i even ate it and i don39t like pot pieplanning on making it agin and will swap out chicken with beef stew meat and beef broth
great pot pie i used frozen mixed veggies and southern style hashbrowns to cut down on some of the prep
excellent recipe i like to make a double batch and freeze the filling then i can make pies later when i39m having a busy week this one is a keeper
i made this recipe a couple weeks ago but didn39t buy the second pie crust i froze the remaining mixture and after getting a second crust my other pie is now in the oven and i can hardly wait to eat it this is a very tasty recipe and i plan on making it in the future thank you
just finished making this and it39s one of the best chicken pot pies i39ve ever eaten followed the recipe exactly and it39s amazingmost recipes online don39t turn out so great but this one didi39d let it sit a little longer than 15 min to set a little better but will be making this again and again
i have tried many pot pie recipes and this is hands down the best i clicked on some of the other reviews that were 12 stars because i couldn39t imagine why no one would like this my best guess if you think it is too floury or too much thyme then maybe try again because honestly i make these for anyone who is sick birthdays neighborsand they rave constantly maybe a misstep in the recipe was done the directions are correct and i like that they have the frozen bake time it is listed separate for easy understanding i love being able to have a frozen option such as this instead of soupchili all the time
scrumptious i have been searching for a chicken pot pie recipe and this one is a keeper i didn39t have any thyme so i substituted with poultry seasoning using only half the amount required perfect
excellent so often we all make a small tweak in the recipe but i made this just as the directions stated ok i made one tiny change and used closer to 2 12 cups of potatoes rather than 2 cups but those cubed potatoes were just sitting there on my cutting boardvery very good even my 39food particular39 mother loved it and was willing to take home leftovers
very very good i have never really liked other chicken pot pie39s that i have had in the past but my husband and daughter love them and they39ve been asking me to make it forever when i saw the video for this recipe it looked easy enough and i had all the ingredients already i didn39t realize this was a double recipe though since it made enough for two pot pies i gave one away and they really enjoyed it to the only thing i will change next time is so skip the corn and add two cups of green peas just because i think it looks prettier with more green in it
made this today half recipe and loved it i used a cup of the frozen hash browns instead of fresh potatoes and that worked fine this is a keeper
chill the filling completely to keep the crust from being doughy
the cook time at the top doesn39t match the bottom an additional 75 minutes was not built into my planning time i39ll be eating at 10pm can39t let you know how it is until thenoh wait i just reread this after reading several reviews and finding one that mentions time that39s the frozen pie option time to take it out of the oven
i have made this often and it is a great dish my fatherinlaw loves it and is always asking when i will be making again because he would love another one soon
i39ve been making this recipe for the past year it39s absolutely delicious i usually freeze one of the two which i love it39s great knowing you have a meal ready in the freezer if needed this meal is perfect for the colder seasons i also appreciate that it39s a recipe that you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand i love celery so i39ll saute celery with the onions and if i have green beans or anything else i can make additions or adjustments with the veggie amounts
this is the best chicken pot pie recipe i have ever made it is delicious and freezes well
in a wordfabulous followed the recipe as is except halved for the two of us and due to personal preference left out the corn but put in extra carrots and potatoes
this is an excellent recipe i did add three hard boiled eggs i reduced the tymeand salt as suggested and it was fabulous i do recommend doubling the sauce through it was too dry
made this the first time as written i felt it was too salty and the thyme flavor was overwhelming the second time i used sodium reduced broth eliminated the salt and cut the pepper and thyme to a 12 tsp it came out perfect it is definitely a keeper
it was absolutely delicious my family of 7 devoured this i did make my own crust my husband and son said if i was to change anything the only thing they would want was more chicken i followed the recipe perfectly and i thought the seasonings were perfect as well as the amount of flour and i am not a meat fan so i thought the amount of chicken was perfect
i made this recipe for the first time it39s by far the best pot pie recipe i39ve ever hadmade i ended up with enough filling for 3 pies based on the recipe but i39m not complaining it turned out perfect by following the recipe not sure why other reviews indicate needing to use less flour or seasonings
i always use my own pastry but the filling was spot on this was a typical roux so am uncertain why many thought it was too much flour as with any roux you must cook long enough with liquid to make it a somewhat thick but creamy white sauce before adding the other ingredients so maybe that is the case will definitely keep this in the 34wheelhouse34 of recipes
this one is a keeper i39ve tried a lot of different recipes almost each time i try a new one i think this one is the best yet i followed what others have said and added less saltpepperthyme but love the thyme in it i doubled this recipe i had just pulled apart 2 rotisserie chickens and had a lot of meat and i could have made 3 decent size deep dish pot pies from that amount had i enough pie crust as it was i ended up with 2 deep dish probably over filled pies with one going to the freezer and i still some filling left over that i can make probably 3 mini pies from once i make more pie crust
i loved this recipe however cut the salt and pepper in half or at least i did otherwise it would be too saltyalso i have an electric oven and at 425 degrees it only took 25 mins to bake the amt of thyme was fine my husband loved it and had two helpings i didn39t think it was too thick at all it was perfect because you added a lot of liquid ingredients milk and chicken broth and butteri didn39t rate it a 34534 only because the salt and pepper was way too much definitely have to cut it in half otherwise it was excellent bon appetit
tasty based on the other reviews used less flour and increased the spices a little
my family and i were not a fan of this recipe it was so thick with all the flour and we couldn39t taste anything but thyme it was a bit salty as well the seasonings were just overpowering i think this would better suit my families tastes if the seasonings and flour were cut in half
awesome
this recipe is fantastic and simple i cut it in half and only added some extra seasonings to the original recipe it turned out wonderful my husband had his plate clean before i was halfway through it39s a keeper
love this recipe i have made it three times and my family have commented how good it tastes it is nice to use whatever you have on hand one family member can39t have corn so i just added mushrooms and celery love you can freeze one for later it is in my recipe box as a keeper
yum great chicken pot pie recipe made my own homemade crust recipe on allrecipes httpallrecipescomrecipe12492piecrustiv great consistency would add a little more spices
hands down the best chicken pot pie recipe out there
very good pie plus it makes two of them
this was awesome and to have one for the freezer too is such a bonus the thyme is the key ingredient that makes it unique amp yummy
absolutely love this
love the previous reviewers idea of using the frozen pie crusts on the bottom and one package of the refrigerated crusts for the top you are freeing up your pie plates from being in the freezer and if you take one to someone else they don39t have to return the plate so good
absolutely fantastic this is the best recipe for chicken potpie and much rather use the amount of butter in this recipe than canned cream soups which most potpie recipes use i halved the recipe amp followed the recipe exactly however right before putting it in the oven i brushed the top crust with egg wash karen thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all
i39ve made this recipe numerous times and it always comes out great i cut the recipe in half and use half of the required flour amount because we like our gravy thinner i add two tablespoons of white wine to the brothmilk mixture i also only use one crust on top no crust on the bottom this recipe is a keeper
this recipe is great i made one pie then froze the rest to use in a new pie crust later
absolutely delicious and easy to make hearty meal that sticks to your ribs
i always make these ahead and freeze them when i39m using up leftover chicken or turkeyi have one little trick i use i buy two premade pie crusts and only one package of therefrigerated rolled out pie crust i can freeze the pies readytobake without having to do so in my pie platesi fill the ready made crusts with the filling then brush the edges with egg wash top with pie crust sheets and press firmly with fork to adhere togetherthis makes the perfect 39no clean up39 dinner for busy days especially during the holidays
i39ve been making this chicken potpie for a few years now and can39t believe i39ve never reviewed it i only make half because there39s just the two of us but this is the only pot pie i ever make because it39s easy doesn39t use canned soup and taste excellent if you don39t have exactly what39s in the recipe you can substitute anything your heart desires and it39s always good thanks karen johnson for making me look like a great cook
cut the recipe in half as only two of us excellent as is i only added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg to the roux just because i always add nutmeg to a roux not sure with the thyme i really needed it in this one also needed bit more broth than stated or sauce gets to dry great dish update on the warm up with leftovers did get very dry if left overs next time will add a can of cream chicken soup or make more roux still delicious even dry
i made this pot pie for dinner very good i cut the recipe i half came out great the next time i make it i39ll make a looser gravy since we like lots of gravy in ours
this is a very good chicken potpie but be aware that it makes alot i was unable to fit it into 2 9 inch pie pans and used two larger deep dish rectangular dishes i really like the flavor of the filling and the fact that nothing canned was used all vegetables either fresh or frozen
delicious easy also freezes well
this is a great recipe the first chicken pot pie that my family really likes and requests i have made it three times and it turns out perfect every time and warms up nicely the next day
very yummy i halved and made one pie with home made crust and vegetarian chicken
i am not normally a huge fan of chicken pot pie however i had lots of thanksgiving leftovers to use so i thought i would try one well boy and i glad i did i am now a believer this is the best chicken or turkey pot pie i have ever eaten even my husband raved i did leave out the corn and probably lowered the amount of thyme my shaker bottle wouldn39t let me take the lid off so i just poured a couple of shakes worth in the sauce this recipe halves well as i wasn39t about to make 2 pot pies see first comment about not liking pot pie i will definitely make the full recipe next time and freeze one thanks for the amazing recipe
omg it was fabulous i used sweet potatoes insteadjust great
this recipe is very easy and forgiving and lends itself well to substitutions i find the amount of filling is more than you need so i make little puff pastry pockets whith what is left over and it is a big hit i agree with other reviewers about the thyme and the butter i use about half as much of both with a good result i am no fan of store bought pastry so i used the betty crocker two crust pie recipe which is deliciously flaky if somewhat tricky to roll but if you put the dough between two pieces of parchment paper is comes out perfect
i39ve made this pie on a couple of times and every time it gets rave reviews even from the kids i also like that i can freeze one or give it away great recipe and delicious
jeanettenfrench i substitute beef and beef broth all the time i use broth instead of milk alsoi love this recipe have used it for a long time now
this is the best like others i use my own pastry recipe i have made it like stated which is great but i like it the best made with left over gravy and 14 to 12 cup of cream and less salt my family love it i make two cook them both eat one freeze one or give it away to friends or family thxs karen johnson
i made this tonight it tastes great the consistency is perfect i used almond coconut milk instead of regular milk and 34 cup butter instead of the full cup i would agree with the other reviews to use less thyme as i did not it is just a tad bit much if you use the whole teaspoon i plan on freezing the other half of the filling to use at a later date with biscuits good luck
can i make this with beef instead of chicken and use beef broth for chicken
we liked this very much i made this recipe as stated i followed the directions after freezing a pie and it took longer to bake then stated in recipe just be prepared for a longer bake time
i made this for dinner tonight and everyone enjoyed it the sauce was so good what i liked most is that it didn39t required canned soup i used my own chicken broth and next time i will make my own crust i prefer to cook from scratch and not used processed food so good and perfect for a chilly night
would like to make for concession stand food can i use biscuits instead
this was wonderful prepared as written except i used homemade pie crust instead of store bought it received rave reviews thank you for sharing
this recipe is delicious a keeper for sure i used a rotissiserie chickenand pilsbury pie crustmakes it fast and easy the only thing i changed was i used italian seasoning instead of thyme
have not made this pie yet but wanted to ask if anyone has made this with a top crust only thanks sukie
yummy i use asparagus and use large cupcake pans for mini pies
i have made this chicken pot pie recipe several times and it is a huge hit in my household thick creamy sauce and the thyme gives it just the perfect taste on occasion i have used bisquick to make the crust giving it more of a doughboy type of topping whether you choose to make the filling and doughboys for a chicken stew or follow the crust directions for a pot pie both are absolutely delicious
this is a five star recipe it is super everyone ate this down and then ate seconds i39ve made this often since it is now requested all the time i make both pies with my own pie pastry recipe with great results even served this to my guests who all were very impressed
this is amazing i make my own crusts and throw in whatever i have for ingredients and seasoning but i love the white sauce combo of butter flour milk and broth this recipe is so versitle i39ve made it 4 times so far and never used the same veggiesmeatspices and it always turns out great makes one to eat and one to freeze ps my 2 year old loves this this last time i used salt pepper garlic powder and mrs dash garlic for seasonings about a tsp each chicken for meat carrots sweet potatoes and a bag of frozen mushroms broccoli and beans
pvery good i mixed in a little cheese as well and next time i39ll add chopped cooked bacon keeper recipe for surep
nice recipe with lots of flavor the filling is thick enough that it does not run out in the pan when you cut it definitely a keeper
great recipe and so easy the first time i made it i cut the recipe in half and made one pie the second time i made it i cut the recipe in half and made three small 512 inch individual pies the next time i will make the full recipe and make individual pies and freeze some i followed the recipe exactly except i added a little extra broth to make it more creamy i absolutely love this recipe this is my goto chicken pot pie recipe thank you for sharing
very yummy my sil wanted chicken pot pie and this was a complete hit
question how does the baking instructions change after you freeze the pie
very easy to follow and truly fantastic go easy on the thyme maybe just bake the chicken with rosemary and thyme and not stick it directly into the roux and don39t dice the potatoes too small or they kind of turn into a mash when baked
this is a five star pie
this is a family favorite it is versatile and is a good basic recipe which allows for changing up the vegetables or even meats used the saucegravy is delicious and not too heavy easy to prepare so no need to use canned soups it is true comfort food and we enjoy it year around i would like to say that the second pie makes it to the freezer but it often doesn39t
excellent recipe and easy to make i cut the recipe in half and make one pot pie
excellent thank you so much for this yummy recipe changes i made i only used 12 cup of butter i added fresh asparagus i large diced and roasted the asparagus and the carrots together also added celery and sauted that with the onion one can of corn instead of frozen used 4 cups of broth instead of 3 i used half amp half instead of milk also used whole wheat flour as i was out of white flour very pleased we could not taste the difference in the flour and will use it again when making thismy husband said marie callender39s a chain famous for their pies and pot pies should use this recipe thanks again
great recipe i agree with the comments that a homemade crust would be even better i used pilsbury refrigerator pastry crust and it turned out pretty good very easy to pull together and the best part knowing there is another pie in the freezer
this pie had rave reviews from my familyeveryone loved it my only change was that the sauce got a little too thick so i added more chicken stock came out perfect
omg what a recipe todiefor delicious i want to add a photo of my pie but there appears to be no manner in which to do so
this recipe was absolutely wonderful i rolled my own crust so it took me a little longer my whole family loved it even my very picky soontobe10yr old liked it and asked for more
this recipe was fantastic it took me one hour including the pastry dough i used chef ramsey quick puff pastry recipe my adjustments were i used baby potatoes with skin 1 can of corn 1 cup of peas and 1 cup of vanilla almond milk i used an extra 12 cup of chicken broth to compensate for the thickness of the almond milki did not use thyme or carrots because they are flavors my family does not enjoybon appetite
tasty comfort food substantial meal for a cold day my husband loved it the prep time is not accurate if you peal and cut your own potatoes onions and carrots count on prep time of at least 1 12 hours if you buy a rotisserie chicken from costco or another store you need to buy two chickens for this recipe this recipe makes 2 large pies it39s enough supposedly to feed 16 people but realistically 2 pies will feed about 810 adults because you will eat more than an eighth of a pie we are average adults and the two of us ate a half of a pie it39s so heavy that you will not need anything else other than the pie for dinner the diced potatoes get 34lost34 in the pie maybe i should cut them in larger pieces next time this would be a great hit for a pot luck
wow this was phenomenal i actually ran out of allpurpose flour for the first time in my life i had to work with whole wheat flour i made my own crusthighly recommend and the filling was just perfect my husband said this was amazing my goto recipe was the allamerican turkey pot pie on toh but this one wins however i will continue to make the crust from the turkey recipeits to die for
a win with my family my husband was tasting before it went in the oven and said it can be eaten just like thatthanks for sharing this recipe
made this last night everybody loved it i added another 1 tsp of salt because what was called for in the recipe just wasn39t enough this took the flavor from just ok to yummy and i was out of peas so i used cut green beans prep time took me a little longer than i expected but was worth it in the end because i get two pies out of the deal i also ran short on crust i had already used one crust for a pumpkin pie so i only had 3 and needed 4 so instead of fully covering both pies i just used cookie cutters on the 3rd crust and covered most of the surface of both pies with snowmen and gingerbread men shapes kids loved it filling comes out firm so it doesn39t spill all over also even though boxed crust says to cook at 450 i did what the recipe said and did 425 for 35 mins in gas oven and it was perfect this will be my go to chicken pot pie recipe
tasted okay my family liked but next time no thyme
sounds so good but i am going to try boiling the vegs in some of the chicken broth using the broth as directed after draining it should give it a better flavor
i made this last night and my family absolutely loved it it was the first time my kids ever had chicken pot pie i used mix vegetables instead of the carrots and peas separate and added celery salt i made 2 pies and it was all gone in 35 min great recipe after that my wife wants me to cook every night
this is a fantastic recipe it is one of my goto recipes when making a meal for a friend i can make one and have an extra to take to someone or leave in the freezer for a busy night
this is great i made my own crust and it was much better i also used our leftover turkey from thanksgiving which is now becoming a tradition that the whole family loves much better than turkey sandwiches every day for a weeki cut back on the butter by half and used sour cream in lieu of milk as we never seem to have milk in our house it turned out great it39s hard to find a recipe that produces a thicker pie versus a thin one i will always use this recipe from now on
this was a super recipe very tasty even my picky 5 yr old wanted morei just have to work on perfecting my pie crust
this recipe is fantastic i made this as written but for one pie i used the breast meat from a costco chicken and a bag of mixed vegetables to make it easier i am going to make the filling again tomorrow and will toss it into the freezer for busy days
i loved this recipe only made one chicken potpie and saved the rest to serve over mashed potatoes very tasty
i made this last night and my family was wowed it is hearty and tasty and for my large family we are always having to double recipes this one made plenty for dinner and for lunch leftovers it totally hits the spot when you are looking for a fall comfort food recipe
this is an extremely delicious recipe my husband ate an entire pie to himself in one day for breakfast lunch and dinner i am currently going to the market now to gather the ingredients to make more a major hit in my household
delicious a fair amount of prep work but the results are worth it thick creamy flavorful
this is a really good recipe my husband absolutely loved it and so did my boys you have got to try it
flavor was perfection
really good def the best pot pie i have ever had i am a vegetarian so i swapped out the chicken for mushrooms and the chicken broth for vegetable broth amazing thank you great end of work weekfriday night comfort food meal
this is the best chicken potpie my kids would never eat potpie now they ask for it
this was great actually made it twice in one week first time i only made 12 the recipe because it is only me and my younger son it was gone by the next morning today i made the full recipe i am working all weekend and wanted something here for him easy to heat up the only variations i made were using 1 tsp of pepper instead of 34 and fresh thyme instead of dried try it
i absolutely loved this i made it for my family and although it took a while it was worth it i used a rotisserie chicken from albertsons and just used the chicken breasts instead of canned or fresh chicken stock i used chicken bouillon i also used a bottom and top biscuit crust biscuit crust recipe httpwwwfoodcomrecipechickenpotpiewithbiscuitcrust26846 to keep the crust from getting soggy i baked the bottom crust for about 15 minutes before adding the filling it only needed to bake for 3035 minutes
my boys loved this i omitted the milk in the filling because there seemed to be plenty of liquid already
every one enjoyed found recipe very easy also liked they told you wine to serve
good chicken pie i wasn39t sure i had frozen peas and didn39t want to dig through the deep freeze to see if i could find any so i substituted frozen chopped broccoli so there would be some green in it i was going to make my own pie crust but decided not to bother because i had some biscuit mix so i mixed some up and dropped biscuits over the top of the casserole i cut down on the thyme added maybe an eight of a teaspoon since i don39t like things too heavily seasoned also i halved everything as i just wanted one pie delish will make again and next time will probably make a pie crust from scratch when i39m not as rushed for time another thingi don39t think it needs a bottom crust just one over the top
you will never make another chicken pot pie after making this one it is well worth the effort if using frozen pie shells like the tenderflake i find i can get three pies out of this recipe i also add chopped parsnips with the carrots and then cut down on the frozen veggies the richness of the sauce is just incredible even my one year old eats an entire piece
this was wonderfulperfect combination of ingredients and very flavorful it does take a while to put together but a lot can be done ahead eg cook and freeze individual bags of chicken to have on hand to save time i just bought packaged veggies 2 and added the chicken and potato my husband loved it
nan
i know this may seem crazy to ask but when it says poor the potatoe mixture in is it talking about the water you cook the potatoes in
this was delicious and i turned it vegan substituted soy milk and soy butter faux chicken strips but essentially the same i did put a little more pepper and salt in to counteract the sweetness of the soy milk in any case it was a huge hit b
fantastic my whole family loved the flavor definitely a keeper
this recipe was perfection my husband could not say enough good things about it he said 34now this is what a chicken pot pie should taste like34 i followed the recipe exactly i did use yukon gold potatoes instead of a regular baking potato at first i thought i would cut the recipe in half as i didn39t think i needed two pies worth but i am so glad i went ahead and made both the chopping is a bit time consuming so i am glad that now i will get two meals out of this one night of work i put the other pie in the freezer for the future and cannot wait to have it for a simple meal a few weeks from now loved this
my husband told me this recipe was a keeper and i can39t take the leftovers to work i am really glad i picked this recipe to try we loved it
really filling i added some dill and parsley flakes for some more flavor and i added some poultry seasoning to the broth for a little chicken flavor boost baked pie came out wonderful second pie into the freezer hope to enjoy that next month
this was delicious and satisfying i used my own crust recipie so i could make one large pie instead of two total hit and my family loved it great comfort food
fantastic so good don39t get to freeze the second pie
made it for dinner tonight delicious my family loved
this was super good and easy this was the first recipe i39ve used to make a chicken pot pie and it39s a keeper however the second time i made this i used only one crust and made more of the brothgravy mixture i froze this one to cook later i followed the how to cook the frozen pie instructions but my pie was still cold after it should39ve been ready it took an additional 45 minutes and i increased the oven temperature it was still tasty just disappointed it took a long time too cook through
this was pretty good my 1st attempt at making a chicken pot pie and it turned out it was very easy to make too so that was nice i will make a few changes next time and see how it goes i39ll probably do less thyme and will try homemade crust but all in allvery good recipe will be making again
this is still a 5 star having it for christmas dinner this year per family request
this is the pot pie recipe i always use because it is so rich and satisfying i use half the butter and flour and add a few more herbs and some white pepper i love that the recipe makes two pies i make one for us and one to bless another family
i39ve made this three times now and my family still raves about how much they love it full of flavor drives me crazy waiting for it bake i highly recommend this recipe the leftovers reheat just as tasty wonderful cold weather comfort food
this was delicious everyone had seconds the only downside was my largest frying pan which is quite large was not big enough i would suggest using a dutch oven instead
this was a great dish i didn39t have any milk so i used cream of chicken instead it made the filling very think but it tasted fantastic
love this recipe get so many compliments when i make it
this was so good i wasn39t sure how the leftovers would be but they were just as good as the first day it was cooked
this was a huge hit with my family even my husband who has never been a fan of chicken potpie it took some time to prep but it was well worth the effort i love freezer cooking so having a pie for the freezer was a definite plus i used deep dish pie crusts and this made 2 very full pies delicious
this was a huge hit with my family even my husband who has never been a fan of chicken potpie it took some time to prep but it was well worth the effort i love freezer cooking so having a pie for the freezer was a definite plus i used deep dish pie crusts and this made 2 very full pies delicious
this was so good amp easy to make i only used 1 pie crust per pie amp left out the thyme it39s nice to know i have one pie in my freezer for a busy night
my family did not care for it the first time i made it because of the thyme one whole pie went to waste made it again without the thyme loved it no leftovers this time loved the ease of the refrigerated pie crust
very tasty and filling great way to use up leftover chicken i used evaporated skim milk for the milk which gave it an extra creamy taste without adding any more fat and i used fresh thyme and a heavy sprinkle of poultry seasoning i made four deep dish individual pies and i could only eat half of one
excellent flavor the gravy would be good on other dishes as well i only used a top crust
i followed the amounts given and could have made 3 pies next time i will not add the potatoes just a personal flavor choice and i suggest allowing the filling to cool before adding the top crust looking forward to trying this with other poultry and veggie combos
we had this for dinner tonight we loved it i added fresh garlic with the onion next time i plan on adding chopped celery delicious
great recipe but for our family i will omit the thyme next time i did increase the broth by 1 cup to make it creamier
this recipe is delicious my husband loves it and so do i i like that it makes 2 potpies i usually make one and freeze the other for another night
this is a delicious pot pie recipe my husband absolutely adored it i frequently halve the recipe to feed just my family but when there is a new mom or a friend under the weather this is the perfect meal to take to them and still have dinner for your family as well you can never go wrong with classic comfort food
i apologize but the amount of thyme you called for was ridiculous it drowned out every other flavor including the whole chicken we smoked the day before the idea of the rouxbased gravy was well constructed but i used less flour than what the recipe called for and i found the consistency a bit much i love the idea of adding potatoes though the lesson this girl learned today stay away from actual written recipes use your gut instinct and remember kids your fingers do the best measuring when cheffing it up onelove
super easy and made it sunday for the week added a bit of garlic power to the mix and baled the chicken in packets with olive oil salt and pepper along with a bit of chopped garlicyum loving it now
this recipe is amazing my family can39t eat any other pie after making this i can typically get three pies out of this recipe but only because we like a little less filling this is by far my most requested recipe
this was so yummy i actually made it in to mini pot pies using a muffin tin they were perfect size for my kids who really liked it i just halved the recipe and used a 4 inch round cutter for the bottom and a 3 inch round for the top and cut it out of the storebought pie crust i also brushed the tops with an egg wash
phenomenal halved the ingredients to make one deep pie as well i didn39t use as much flour either because i noticed the filling to be too thick so i used extra broth to compensate this was delicious
this was great the first pie was wonderful and we had the other one last night cooked that one for an hour at 425 with no temp change and it came out fine
best chicken pot pie very creamy and hearty recipe was easy to follow freezes very well have made with chicken and also with leftover turkey from thanksgiving will make this again and again
also i added a bit extra pepper and salt while mixing before putting everything in the pies it was to dull down the overpowering thyme which did help prior to baking it was strong after obviously
this was great except i felt it called for a bit too much thyme so i will make it with less next time but otherwise it was delicious
i have been making this recipe for years definitely one of my favorites love having one in the freezer for later
this was my first time making a homemade pot pie it turned out great i halved the recipe and made one deep dish pie and had no leftover filling the only change i will make is to use a little bit more chicken broth for the gravy mine ended up just a little too thick even before the boilingthickening stage
first time i ever made a chicken potpie it was excellent my husband and kids enjoyed it and want me to make it all the time thank you for sharing
i made this on 1313 and it was delicious i cut the recipe in half and only made one pie as i was unsure if it would turn out amp it tasted great
this turned out so good i did a few things different thoughi used 34 cup flour and i bought a premade rotisserie chicken from the store and used that also instead of using a crust i baked it for 45 minutes then top it with unrolled cresent rolls and baked until the cresent rolls were golden mmmm so good will def make again
we also had enough filling for a third pie we found that the crust browned before the bottom crust was done cooking but we rather enjoyed the creaminess it added if we make it again we would likely cut the thyme in half and add a second seasoning it was just a lot of the same flavor
this was so good i can39t wait to make the second one thats in the freezer i would put less thyme in it if any but i will be making this again
this was one of the best chicken pot pie recipes i39ve ever used my daughter loves pot pies and this one had a real chicken broth gravy and was seasoned just right and really brought the flavors out of the chicken and the vegetables i will definitely make this again plus it was nice to have an extra to freeze for a future dinner
i cut up the chicken in cubes and sauteed it in some olive oil and sprinkled a little adobo on it once i added the broth to the recipe i also added about a teaspoon full of chicken base to the sauce better than bouillon also i did have to add a little bit extra broth to help thin the filling out a little bit my family and friends loved this
this was crazy easy to make i found though that it filled three regular pie shells probably two deep dish ones reheats beautifully and the seasoning is perfect
really really good used 12 cup ea of butter amp flour as recommended did not have frozen corn so substituted sauted mushrooms amp celery and did not use a bottom crust poured a portion of it kept remainder for another day into an 812 x 9 dish covered w one rolled out sheet of puff pastry sprinkled w minced fresh parsley amp paprika baked 375 for 70 min 6 servings our guests went back for seconds great w double cheese bread amp spinach salad a keeper
absolutely the best chicken pot pie ever i make this often and use whatever veggies i have on hand and it always turns out great i use store bought crusts to speed the process and usually only make one pie and use the extra filling as either gravy on top of the pie or on biscuits or toast later excellent recipe
mmmm best chicken potpie gravy is delicious great for company
yup that was the best darn chicken pie i39ve ever eaten and one to share even better
yup that was the best darn chicken pie i39ve ever eaten and one to share even better
yup that was the best darn chicken pie i39ve ever eaten and one to share even better
yup that was the best darn chicken pie i39ve ever eaten and one to share even better
this has been a family favorite since i first made it when i received this issue of quick cooking we have 6 children so both pies would go in a single meal when all the kids were home now i can usually freeze one for laterunless some of my sons find out i39m making this amp decide to come home for supper that night i substitute 2 cups of frozen corn for the peas as my husband hates most vegetables i39ve also made it with only the potatoes amp onions and i use 1 tsp of poultry seasoning instead of thyme because i don39t like the flavor of thyme my youngest daughter made it on her own for her 13th birthday because i only had the use of one arm at that timei talked her through it amp she was very proud of the compliments she received
seriously only use half the butter it calls for 12 cup instead of 1 cup it is still plenty rich and creamy it was great
very tasty my friends loved it
this is the best i did cut back the butter by 12 a stick i usually double this and make two 9 x 13 pans using homemade pie crust i also just use frozen carrots and skip the potatoes due to a family allergy but it does speed the process up a little bit
this recipe should have way more ratings a little time consuming to make but so worth it the frozen pie turns out great as well
the best chicken potpie ever the first time we prepared this it was great the second time and after we knew what we were doingit was the best thank you so much for sharing this recipe
a real crowd pleaser this is the best chicken pot pie recipe i add extra peas because the everyone likes them
it was great turned out to be a little more work than i thought but was well worth it
my husband and i made this receipt this past weekend chicken potpie is one of my favorite comfort foods and this recipe is the best i39ve ever had will definitely be adding it to my recipe box thanks for sharing this recipe
this is really yummy comfort food i39ve made it twice now amp my 4 kids love it i usually make my own pie crust but i used the store bought to save time and couldn39t believe how good this was and easy
i have done it and i am not so happy it has called a lot of butter and flour so it has strong flour taste and very rich
i made this for the first time at the weekend and it really exceeded my expectations i was amazed at how easy and ridiculously tasty this was i made my own pastry from scratch and can39t wait to make this again thanks for sharing
this is the best pot pie ever i plan on using leftover turkey in it after thanksgiving
so delicious my family loves this and it39s so easy to make
very easy to make and it is super delicious my whole family enjoys it and i enjoy them eating vegetables without arguing
i poached the chicken in broth amp water with lots of poultry seasoning i also added 1 tsp of thyme poultry seasoning amp salt to the mix it was absolutely fabulous
a very yummy comfort food
i made this pie for my family and they loved it i froze the other half and then made it for a work potluck and everyone wanted the recipe i did change it a bit instead of peas i put in frozen broccolli and made it with a homemade crust instead of store bought absoultely a keeper recipe
this is very good i plan to make it again for our church potluck thank you karen johnson
i make this potpie all of the time it is our favorite meal it is delicious i make it for people who are ill or have had a baby and it39s perfect because there is one for them and one for my family every single time i make it i get a request for the recipe i saute the chicken in good spices and chop for the best flavor
this potpie would have been delicious but i thought it had way too much thyme i will try again with only a smidgeon of thyme
my family loved this recipe i think my 17 yr old had 4 helpings and my husband who usually doesn39t like this had 2 helpings i will definitely make it again
great tasting and easy to make i only wanted to make 1 pie so i halfed the recipe and it worked out great
i tested several pot pie recipes before settling on 34the best34 for my recipe box and here it is it39s my goto recipe for taking to new moms or shutins because the double recipe allows me to make dinner for my family and theirs
this is the best potpie recipe i share this one alot
when i want to make chicken pot pie this is the recipe i turn to i have thought about reducing the butter a touch to cut down on the fatthat39s why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5it seems like a bit too much butter in the filling
doubled the recipe and got 5 pies out of it cooking for a very large harvest crew and it was a hit they all loved it to save time i used canned chicken great recipe love that it makes lots i will use this recipe long after harvest its great to have extra in the freezer for those days when you dont feel like cooking
i39m rating this as a 5 even though i haven39t tasted it yet right before summer i made one of theseput in all in a very deep dish pie shell but it got hot and my husband didn39t want me to heat up the house so i gave it to my son and dtr in law and told them to bake it they told me it was the best pot pie they had ever had and it was gone within 24 hrs it39s just the two of them gonna make one for me and hubby this week and freeze the other one as recommended
made this last night my family told me this one is a keeper i bought 2 9 inch deep dish pie crust and i had enough filling to make 3 pot pies and gave one to my neighbor i will definitely make this one again
i tested other potpie recipes trying to find the perfect one this is by far the best and the one that made it39s way into my permanent recipe collection this is one of my favorite dishes to take to new moms or shutins because it39s a double recipe one for my family and one for theirs it39s delicious
forgot to add that i used only 12 cup of butter by accident and it turned out just as good
i absolutely love this recipe and so does my husband i double the amount of thyme and black pepper if i39m short on time i will use 2 15 oz cans of mixed veggies in place of the potatoes carrots corn and peas i also like to use fat free halfandhalf if i have it on hand
my husband and son both loved it i used a pillsbury crust and a leftover store bought bbq chicken my husband grew up on homemade potpies and his mom is the best pastry maker i know so i was ready for an 34it39s okay34 but got a 34wow this is really good one of the best i39ve ever had34 he even went as far to say that he was a little hesitant when i said that i was making a chicken potpie don39t know where that came from as i39m a good cook another plus is that it made two good sized pies
i adapted the recipe and skipped the potatoes and carrots i in turn used 4 cups of frozen mixed vegetables to make this truly a quick fix my family loves it so much that the 2nd pie doesn39t make it to the freezer any more
this is a wonderful pot pie my husband and son loved it there was none left from the one pie
by far the best homemade potpie i have ever made we really really loved it
i love this recipe and use it frequently
this is the best recipe my freezer cooking group uses this every time we get together we have also adapted it to using beef stew meat to make things really easy we buy deep dish pie crusts and top with pillsbury refrigerated rolled pie crusts packed into a 1 gallon freezer bag and labeled with instructions they are so nice for giving to families in need as well as my own home
this turned out great i used less expensive ground beef instead of the more expensive chicken i also made my own pie crust with my favorite recipe the frozen pie tasted like it had never been frozen i don39t need to look for another pot pie recipe this is it
this is my favorite potpie recipe it39s great to make when i need some homemade comfort food
anyone tried baking the chicken in the oven whenever i try to fry on a skillet pan my chicken is always raw in the middle thanks
pamazing flavor and easy to make 2 thumbs up from everyone p
so delicious the whole family agreed this is our favorite homemade recipe
this recipe is a keeper i have made it with chicken steak and shrimp for the steak i added cilantro to the marinade it always tastes super fresh if you are a camper this is a great and easy recipe bc you can marinade the chicken slices while they are in your cooler and if you cut up more onions and peppers you can make kebabs for a 2nd dinner and save money and cooler space i honestly love this recipe its a go to
everyone really loved this i marinated chicken breasts for a few hours in this i forgot to add the lemon juice and used regular kosher salt because thats what i had on hand then i cooked the chicken on the grill i didn39t marinate the peppers but will next time also will try it with shrimp and will do the chicken peppers and onions on one sheet pan all together if i39m not grilling
these were amazing i made them for my teenage son and his friends they didn39t even sit down just stood around the table eating the chicken is wonderful on salads as well i followed the recipe pretty closely though i doubled the marinade to make extra chicken i also ended up marinating the chicken for 3 days it tasted great
so easy and so good my first time to make this and i will definitely make it again
i really enjoyed this recipe my husband told me to remember this one
i have made this dish soooo many times over the past couple of years it always turns out so great personally i put the marinade in the skillet with the chicken probably the best chicken recipe i39ve ever made and it39s pretty easy
fantastic ever since i discovered this recipe in my taste of home magazine i39ve made it at least once a month i serve it over copycat chipotle cilantro lime rice i double the marinade and don39t throw it away so there39s a bit of sauce for the rice seriously one of the best things i39ve ever eaten everyone i39ve served it to loves it quick delicious meal for impressing dinner guests quick delicious meal for impressing your family
delicious why eat fajitas out when their so easy and cheap to make at home
all of my family loved this recipe will definitely make again
sounds great have to try
super delicious just wondering when you write 112 teaspoons is that 15 teaspoons
this is an excellent recipe especially if you39re a beginner it tastes way better than buying them ready made i would however suggest only making this if you39re used to spicy food because the amount of chili in this recipe is far more than regular taste buds can handle so if you39re thinking about following this recipe you should half the amount of chili you use but for the rest this recipe is perfect
excellent recipe have made it many times with chicken but this time i used shrimp amp scallops and it was amazing served it with cilantro lime rice amp homemade salsadelish
mde this recipe tonight with the bean and corn salad to rave reviews this will definitely be part of the dinner rotation thanks for sharing
i left the lemon juice and paprika out when i marinated and i marinated the chicken overnight i did not use peppers because we are allergic to them i did the rest of the recipe as written it was very delicious and tasted just like the fajitas you get at a restaurant i served it with mexican rice and refried beans i will be making this recipe again
excellent recipe simple and delicious
good go to recipe i sometimes use cubes of salmon fillet instead of chickenand just follow the recipe it really works
have been making this almost weekly for years i prep the veggies and chicken on sunday and then just need to cook it monday night after work makes great leftovers for lunch the next day
delicious fajitas we loved them thank you for posting
the video shows no green onions it39s an odd choice for fajitas
very easy and delicious i used onion strips rather than cubed to go with pepper strips i had smoked chicken breasts so precooked that i cut into strips and marinaded for an hour they absorbed the marinade and were incredible these marinated strips are great by themselves and could be used on salads in a pasta etc i39ll use this marinade with smoked chicken breasts by themselves now so delicious fajitas were great too
i make this recipe about once a week we all love it a great use for leftovers is to use it as a pizza topping i buy a whole wheat pizza dough muir glen pizza sauce and mozzerella and top with left over fajita chicken and onions and peppers it is sooooo delicious
i love mexican style meals better than my wife but she gave these five stars also i complimented these with refried beans recipe compliments of ree drummond arroz rojo aka red rice recipe compliments of marcela valladolid and quacamole for the two of us this was to much to eat for one meal but it was excellent the next day two tips the refried beans freeze well for use at a later date if you have plenty of left over quacamole smooth it out on top and gently add a thin layer of water the next day pour the water off and you have quacamole that didn39t turn brown
we love mexican meals and this is a very easy and tasty recipe i followed the recipe exactly and served with cheddar cheese salsa sour cream and guacamole we had this meal last week and my 8 year old grandson couldn39t get enough he likes being able to add only the toppings he wants one family member skipped the tortilla and saved herself some carbs in the future i will also offer black beans or refried beans and rice yummy
i normally leave reviews but this recipe was so good everyone ate it my kids are picky but their plates were wiped clean and my husband really care for chicken breast but said who ever created this recipe is genius very good
these are really good and easy to make i need to make it more often even my husband who is tolerant at best of chicken breast said they were 39good39
this is so delicious and so easy definitely will make every week thank you for making my life better with this easy and fun to make recipe totally awesome will never buy fajita seasoning again
absolutely lovely chicken fajitas are one of my all time favorite but 30 grams of carbs is 2 days of carbs for me so it39s out of my eating range
absolutely killer was a huge hit with the family i let it marinate overnight and cooked in a grill pan on the stove will definitely make this again
tubes of biscuits where does it mention that
this recipe is fabulous i give it 5 stars and i didn39t change a thing followed it exactly my husband exclaimed 34these are really flavorful34 and he didn39t even know that was the recipe title so these fajitas are aptly named and absolutely delicious i ate one the next day for breakfast that39s how good
the marinade adds so much flavor to the chicken building your own fajitas is a really fun option when you have dinner guests or just for a normal nightly dinner
looks lovely but you cannot buy tubes of biscuits in the uk would help to give a recipe for them or a link to one thank you
i ended up making this two nights in a row because everyone loved it so much the first night i forgot to add the paprika to the marinade so i added to the chicken right before cooking it i thought it was more flavorful doing it that way i might try not marinading at all next time
this fajita recipe is so full of flavor everytime it has become a regular on our family39s menu
love this recipe been using it for years more recently in an attempt to increase our vegetable consumption i add a couple of zucchini squash sliced in 4534 long spears which i cook with the onions and peppers makes a great and healthy addition
a family favorite
what i love about this recipe is that you probably have everything in your pantry we make this at least once a week i live with 2 20 something guys and they love fajita bar night i cook the chicken first and then the veggies after so it picks up all that good chicken flavor i serve it 39bar39 style i cut up tomatoes avocado lettuce shredded cheese guac salsa sour cream etc and let everyone build their own fajita this marinade is also excellent with shrimp it is so good i have started putting all of the spices into baggies and then when i want to make the fajitas i just have to add the oil and lemon juice and go 1010 highly recommend
tried this as a change from our old style of fajitas we happened to have all the ingredients on the shelf at home really great taste and fairly easy to make definitely will be having this dish again soon
excellent i made it last week chicken and beef and even the leftovers were tasty having it again tonight this will be on the menu several times a month going to make up a big supply of the spices to save time
very flavorful and would definitely make again we prefer less chili spice we prefer a milder taste so i cut the chili powder in half 14 tsp and left out the optional red pepper it was perfect
delicious and so easy may need to add to our weekly rotation
i cheat like hell out of sheer laziness and cut the prep time in half and this is still a hit with the whole family rather than slicing and cooking chicken peppers and onions i use trader 12oz grilled chicken strips from the refrigerated section and a bag of their frozen fire roasted peppers amp onions i just cut the chicken strips into smaller strips to make them fit better in the tortilla and marinate them exactly as in the recipe when the chicken is done marinating i just heat up the peppers n onions for about 10 minutes and then dump in the chicken to get it warm and done and delicious i also use trader whole wheat lowcarb tortillas that work and taste great in this recipe while saving some calories doing it this way total prep and cook time is about 20 minutes but if you tell anyone think you actually worked hard making it i love cheating
i love this chicken fajitas and i39ll definately try this chicken fajitas recipe this weekend the best thing about this recipe is that it takes very less time in making this recipe even i have a special chicken fajitas stuffed pepper recipe as well check out the recipe here httpswwwrecipespackcomchickenfajitastuffedpeppersrecipe
my acrossthestreet neighbor and her niece made these fajitas for dinner 2 nights ago and were kind enough to invite me to have some with them they followed the recipe exactly and i must say i would not change a thing the level of heat was perfect for me the chicken was tender and flavorful and the peppers just the right amount of 34crunch34 they reminded me of the chicken fajitas i used to get at planet hollywood when i visited atlantic city nj if you haven39t tried this recipe i suggest you try it it will become your new 34go to34 fajita recipe perhaps make them with shrimp instead of chicken next time
i39ve made this recipe twice since the august issue of toh came out wonderful i always order fajitas when at mexican restaurants because i can39t have rice and beans never thought i could make these at home this recipe is a keeper vfe
my family loved this recipe for our chicken fajita night unfortunately i have any chile powder so missed that extra heat but still so tasty thought it might be a little too salty but it was just right i tend to be conservative with my use of spices due to my preferences but he enjoyed this too thanks
we love this recipe i have made it 3 times in a few months it is flavorful and delicious made homemade tortillas to use with it we only add salsa amp sour cream
excellent i made a halfrecipe for the two of us and served it with cheeseandsalsa rice dh thought it was terrific too another keeper from toh
this dish had the perfect blend of spices very flavorful but my mouth wasn39t on fire my family loved this recipe
i never leave reviews because i always forget but this recipe is amazing followed it exactly and am very impressed with how delicious and easy this is
this is my 3rd time making this awesome dish i had to look for it on the internet and found you because i remembered the recipe from before i really enjoy these chicken fajitas
loved the marinade only changed a few things used boneless skinless chicken thighs because i prefer the dark meat added jalapenos with the bell peppers and yellow onion it was pretty dang spicy but i like a lot of heat also i added some of the marinade from inside the bag to the pan with all the veggies and put a lid on for the first 10 minutes to effectively steam them before blackening them on high served the whole thing on rice with refried black beans mixed in note this recipe would also be great on nachos if you dice the chicken smaller or cook it whole and shred it
my family enjoys this fajita recipe so much that we have it once per month i add an extra two peppers and an extra onion
this is the bomb boom boom real authentic real delicious no left overs the plates were scraped i will be making this my hit dish go tofantastically delicious
by far the best fajita seasoning mix i have come across made it the first time as written then for our taste the only thing i did different was decrease cumin to 1 tsp and a pinch and increase chili powder to 12 tsp and a pinch that39s it i have used this for beef also but for beef use 1 tbsp lemon and 1 tbsp lime juice absolutely the best homemade fajitas
made it just like the recipe it39s my favorite dinner on the quick
excellent use for company
excellent flavor will definitely make these again
super simple marinade makes for tasty home made fajiatas i cooked the chicken before the onions and peppers and left them all to warm up together and we really enjoyed our meal
this is the best recipe i have found for chicken fajitas
my daughter
the marinade is what makes these fajitas extra special my husband asked me to make sure and save this recipe
great recipe absolutely delicious
i made these yesterday i cook for one me absolutely delicious you can trust the five stars on this one i only marinated the chicken for less than an hour and these were still delicious i would love to make again and marinate for the full 4 hours i ate some with corn tortillas but i39ve decided i39m going to put this over rice tomorrow for a change yum
these were delicious my husband isn39t usually a huge fan of fajitas he still didn39t eat the onions or peppers but he ate tons of the chicken it39s a win in my book
absolutely delicious time was limited so we did not refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for 14 hours as directed by the recipe we still found the chicken to be abundantly flavorful so much so that when making it again we will not marinate the chicken as it was absolutely delicious and obviously required less timeplanning ahead otherwise there is not a thing i would suggest differently i just wanted to point this out because often times the 34set in the refrigerater for x amount of hours34 deters one from choosing a particular recipe so i want to make it known that if you39re looking for the best chicken fajitas but in a pinch for time that is not a reason to pass this one up highly recommend this was printed off and put into our family cook book as we will be making this often thank you for sharing
made this last night on top of the stove cooked chicken in the marinade without marinating it four hours and it still turned out delicious
love these easy to make fajitas i39ve made them a few times with an easy pico de gallo salsa over rice and they are awesome each timr
wow there was soo much flavor i cooked the chicken and veggies on the grill which i think added that great grilled flavor
doubled had fajitas just had the perfect meat and peppers for lunch made enchiladas from leftovers and all were excellent
i tripled the amount for a dinner party and only added lime zest to the marinade it was delicious
yummy
tasty
made it tonight everyone enjoyed it i will definitely make this again
very flavorful an easy make we really enjoyed it
hi can i put all ingredients in crockpot to cook have you tried that
the whole family loves this one i have made it using lemon juice in the marinade and like juice another time when we have any lemons great both ways
what do you use for seasoned salt
made these fajitas several times and we just love them the only changes i make to this recipe are that i use lime rather than lemon juice and i use a little more red pepper flakes to add a little more heat i always make extra sometimes even doubling the recipe because we really like to eat it the next morning with eggs sometimes mix the chicken onions and peppers with beaten up eggs in a skillet and just scramble it all together sometimes just warm the chicken onions and peppers in a skillet and then serve it with an over easy egg or two right on top yum
excellent well rounded full flavored recipe split between both chicken and flank steak will definitely make again home run
extremely delicious satisfies my cravings for restaurant mexican food i think marinating with the lemon juice makes a big difference
my family loves when i make this for dinner the flavor is really good and i usually have time to marinate the chicken for no longer than 30 min and it still comes out good sure if i took the time to marinate it longer the flavors would be even better but fine with how it turns out
the more gem recipes i39ve located and made on taste of home the less and less i39ve been enticed into going out to eat i can39t think of the last time i had fajitas out that could beat this recipe there is nothing difficult about this recipe and the flavors are huge in this one sometimes i39ve just used chicken tenders to save time but the only change 39ve ever made was to double the amount of bell peppers and chopped onions
i love your recipes but a crazy about this on
prep time took me longer than 20 minutes but it was completely worth the time
this was my 1st time cooking anything remotely mexican food i wanted to learn how to make this for a dinner date i done a test run and it turned out delicious i however have time to marinate so i just slow cooked the chicken while letting it absorb the seasoning i also added barbecue sauce in i will definitely be making this again
this is a solid marinade i added a tablespoon of vinegar and a 14 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some spice and it turned out awesome i marinated for 3 hours it was a bit salty though so i might bring it down to 1 teaspoon next time fyi
i used the recipe as a starting point and it turned out incredible first i added 1 teaspoon each of ground cayenne ground ancho chile and ground chipotle chile this gave it a deeper smokie chili flavor without adding much heat since a added more powders i also increased the oil to make it into a nice marinade paiste i pounded out the chicken breasts so they were equal in thickness and evenly spread the paiste over them when cooking the chicken i started with a very hot grill and cooked them for a minute and a half on each side removed them and let them rest of 20 minutes this left the chicken with nice grill marks and raw in the center i then sliced them into even stips and finished the cooking with the vegatables by cooking the chicken twice i could control the timing of the fajitas for the party we were having
i only marinated for 30 minutes and it turned out delicious next time will marinate longer i did add chicken broth to pan to cook a bit longer to make sure it was well done and it came out very moist cooked it till broth was cooked up and then added veggies to fry up chicken
i am not what you would call a professional cook so making fajitas for the first time was nervewracking but following this recipe and tweaking it to my liking they were absolutely amazing even my mom enjoyed it and she absolutely despises onions they were 10x more delicious and flavourful than any fajita i39ve had at a mexican restaurant and a huge improvement compared to our local one personally i used more lemon juice and a little less cummin but since i like a little spice i used a garlic jalapeno and even fresh jalapeno slices to give it an extra zing fresh cilantro chopped up really gives it an extra oomph too i39ve made it twice now and both times it39s came out super delicious
love this recipe very tasty
like others i used 1 t lemon juice and 1t lime juice just wondeting what people used for the seasoning salt
excellent
i am from south texas and this is the best fajita marinade i have ever made i highly recommend it as is we did dive the chicken and then cooked it on the stovetop in the marinade
can i make this recipe in the oven on a sheet pan if so time and temp thanks
best fajitas i39ve ever had sand so easy to make better than at a restaurant i plan on making these at least once a week
this is the best chicken fajita recipe tried several but none are as good and simple as this my family loves them and now i make this meal at least once a week
my family and i loved this recipe the chicken was so flavorful and we will be making this again
awesome will be making again
was looking for something different to make when i ran across this fajita recipe sounded very good and after reading several reviews decided to try it i used less chicken than it called for i used yellow red and green bell peppers and cut the onion in larger pieces did not have cumin so put in cilantro 1tbsp of lemon and 1tbsp lime juice marinated for about 2hrs i love cooking in cast iron and i use a counter top hot place that i can adjust the temperature to precise numbers i used 375 degrees the flavors were absolutely wonderful my husband said that was the best fajita he has ever had thanks for this fantastic recipe
shamim shabbir kaniz fatema foods in app
i first made this recipe about a year ago for a family gathering it was so simple but so tasty and got rave reviews from everyone since then i have made it many times and use this chicken on salads as well as in tortillas
loved this easy to make and delicious i did change a couple things not minor i used avocado oil cut the lemon juice down from 2 tbsp to 1tbsp and used 1tbsp of lime juice this recipe is a keeper and will make it again and again
i didn39t change anything my family loves this recipe and asks for it often love the spices better than packaged fajita seasoning
i used lime juice instead of lemon i just like it better and i marinated whole thinly sliced chicken breasts for four hours it was fantastic this is my new go to chicken fajita recipe
loved all the spices marinaded for about 4 hours then cooked this will be the way i make fajijas from now on thanks
so easy and so tasty i only marinaded the chicken for about 20 minutes i was in a hurry and it was still very flavorful this will definitely become a staple for me
really liked this fajita recipe even the hubby liked it
family really liked these but i39m not a fajita fan so it only gets four stars
i used lime juice instead of lemon juice and added cilantro on top these are delicious and now on our general rotation yum yum yum
so good and very easy to make all i added was a couple of splashes of hot sauce
i39ve made this twice and it is very flavorfully perfect amount of heat as is for someone who likes spicyhot but tongue can39t handle too much if you enjoy a good chicken fajita you should try
to cynthia below who cannot eat cooked bell pepper maybe some chopped pimentos they have that peppery taste actually in cherry pepper family but you can try the chopped ones in a jar just a thought and suggestion have not tried this recipe yet but plan on within next week recipe sound great
made this tonight exactly as directed it was good i39ll probably make this again
just made these tonight made exactly as instructed except i have oregano just italian seasoning mix so i used that they were excellent my husband said yum after first nite and proceeded to inhale 3 of them definitely a make again and again
i have a question for whatever reasons i can no longer tolerate cooked bell peppers raw are fine cooked make me very sickit39s not pretty there are so many recipes i make that are enhanced by bell peppersanyone know of anything that makes a decent substitute and adds flavor to the recipe some things like fajitas i can keep things separated as i make them but others have to be all mixed together so cannot do all suggestions very much appreciated
made exactly as written and they were some of the best fajitas i39ve ever made
we loves inmy family we use the seasongs for chicken tacos and nachos best ever
followed the recipe exactly and was delicious
these were very good and flavorful they are easy to make and a crowd pleaser
love fajitas these hit the spot
34until crisp and tender34 it39s one or the other
i have been making these for a few years now and they are always a great meal you really don39t need to change anything with this recipe just follow it and enjoy
i have tried so many different fajita recipes and it seemed nothing was ever good enough this is the best recipe for fajitas so far and ive been looking a long time i didn39t follow the directions exactly though i used chicken i had precooked dumped it into marinade for about 10 min tops while i sliced veggies then i put the chicken in a hot skillet with all the marinade let it heat a min before tossing in all the peppers and onion then i cooked it all til my preferred doneness of veggies
am try to make it
i have made this dish twice a week and hubby loves it more than i do it isgoing to be a stable dish in myhouse now and i am never ever ordering fajita in resturants anymore it is so easy convinent and delicious dish thank you for the receipe
i made this recipe hundreds of times starting back in 2000 when it first appeared in the magazine and i was a newlywed my 13yearold likes it and my 8yearold just started to like it i just leave out the crushed red pepper flakes and i use red onion this recipe is in regular rotation in this house
successful weekday dinner super delicious and easy to make i would know i am not the best cook lol
i was skeptical of this recipe but it was so flavorful and delicious a hit with even my picky 5 year old i will for sure be making this again
i made this and added shredded cabbage to the sauteed peppers and onions i did add extra onions and peppers i also added slightly more crushed red peppers we absolutely loved this recipe there is something about the lemon flavor that we liked the hub went for seconds and said you can make a lot
when your three year old son who only eats chicken nuggets says chicken is yummy you know you have a winner this is a real delicious dish i make it often now because also so simple great quick weekday meal
so tastyi love this recipe
so tasty even my wife who doesn39t get excited about fajitas thought they were good i felt they could have used a lot more peppers and onions though next time i39ll probably use twice as much i also salted the peppers and onions while they sauteed
so tasty quick and easy i let the chicken sit in the seasoning while i cut the veggies i omitted the green onions and since i love veggies used lots of peppers 2 red 2 orange 1 yellow 12 a lg poblano and a lg yellow onion i lightly salted the veggies as they cooked with some garlic powder the chicken was so tender and everything was flavorfulyum
these are especially good my husband doesn39t normally like leftovers but he asked me if we had enough left for another meal the only thing i did differently was to add yellow amp orange sliced peppers to the red and green very good meal
this made delicious fajitas loaded with flavor but still somehow pleasantly mild they were especially good with the sour cream my family loved this recipe definitely a keeper
this is amazingly good delicious i am the only female i doubled the recipe for the four men in the house i hardly had any left great recipe definitely a keeper lt3
this was delicious the fist time so i had to do it againthank you
delicious i only put my chicken in the marinade for an hour but still tasted amazing also i didn39t have lemons so i used lime juice instead and nonetheless fajitas were amazing
these fajitas were delicious i loved how the marinade formed a coating on the chicken also it was a beautiful day outside so i left the chicken whole when marinating then grilled it i will definitely make these again
so tasty this will be an often used recipe at our house
wow this really is a 5 star recipe i made these into fajita bowls with cauliflower rice and it was really phenomenal the chicken was so tender and the onions and peppers were delish definitely reccommend
this was soooooo good surprisingly my hubs who doesn39t care for fajitas had 3 he said these were the best he39s had my son loved them too thanks for sharing
this is delicious i also made it with shrimp and it was also very good
i love chicken fajitas and this is definitely a keeper my mom who is 92 loves it i marinate the chicken overnight and i wouldn39t change a thing
this was given a thumbs up by the whole family easy and delicious
these were really good i had a few options for everyone they chose a tortilla tortilla chips or rice to spoon this mixture over great either way
these were great i doubled the recipe and good thing too i made three changes halved the cumin cooked the chicken along with the marinade would have been impossible to separate anyway and added extra salt i did include the crushed reds as recommended we even eat them on tortillas saving carbs and they were still great
had this tonight and the chicken was so tender and flavorful hubby and son loved this saying it39s restaurant quality a repeater for sure
fantastic
this is a fab recipe i make the seasoning in large quantity and use 2 tabs of it every time i make it that way it saves a lot of time
very good mexican flavored fajitas hubby son amp grandbaby loved them next time i39ll add black beans per hubby39s request i did saute chicken in a tab spoon of butter amp used veg oil for marinade as well will defiantly be making again
this will be my third time making this dish via this recipe it is simple and delicious took me about 15 mins to find this recipe after sifting through a bunch of different site recommendations but only this one would do i added 2 large garlic cloves and substituted peanut oil for canola but only on my third attempt and as it is still marinating i can only highly suggest the recipe to a t but that isn39t a bad thing this recipe is delicious on it39s own approved by my fiance and two children 8amp10yrs old
best fajita recipe ever my husband who doesn39t like 34too many vegetables34 in his dinner gobbled these up i usually double the recipe it reheats just fine
this is the best fajita recipe i39ve found yet i prefer to sub lime juice in place of lemon juice and i let the chicken marinate for a couple of hours also i dump the chicken plus marinade into the skillet without discarding the sauce i love the inclusion of green onions in this recipe i usually serve it with homemade guacamole everyone wants seconds
i made these last night and they were really good i chopped my chicken into chunks instead of strips so they are easier to eat i will make them again soon i made enough for leftovers for salads this week
excellent quick and easy to make
easy and delicious i can fix side dishes while this is baking awesome
very good not salty and very good flavor everybody loved it i put everything into the electric skillet and marinaded the chicken over night
i just cooked this recipe to a tee for my cuban family and everybody loved it i doubled the portions of everything to make more for a big group of people and made a cilantro salsa to top it off with that just put the final touch on this restaurant quality recipe the only thing different was i let the chicken marinate overnight which was a good choice because the flavors infused into the chicken and i splashed lemon juice all over the final product to get it extra zest plus it just looks cool and like i know what i39m doing i don39t i39m just good at following directions absolutely delicious this is now my go to fajita recipe
super tasty i made a couple tweaks as i don39t have a grill baked the chicken at 450 in the oven for 17 minutes keeps the chicken juicy inside but cripsy out so you can kind of get that grill feeling also served with homemade guac see my full version here httpsgoogl4rfasy
my husband and i really enjoyed these i just usedthe regular onions and omitted the green onions
my favorite chicken fajita recipe had this last night and for lunch today love it and so does my husband
i have made this recipe a few times now and it is definitely flavorful i make it exactly to the recipe and always refrigerate it overnight this recipe is a keeper thank you
this recipe is awesome as is my husband recommended broiling the chicken in our toaster oven to keep the meat tender 10 minutes per side and while cooking the vegetables in the pan it came together very quickly and turned out great
this was so delicious and simple we like things spicy so i also sprinkled in some hot sauce and as i was sauting the meat i also sprinkled a few drops of liquid smoke yummy
i made this for dinner tonight for company and it was a hit it goes really well with rice and refried beans super easy i also used olive oil instead of what the recipe initially called for i will be keeping this recipe for sure
i love fajitas and this recipe did not fail me delicious blend of spices my husband prefers shrimp so for his i used the same seasonings and just added frozen shrimp instead of chicken he said they were great
delish the whole family raved and the best part is it is such an easy meal to prepare i had a cooled roasted chicken i needed to use so i cut the breasts into thin slices one family member cannot have seasoned salt so i used garlic salt instead and eliminated the garlic powder i tossed the chicken with the marinade and let it sit for just a couple minutes while i sliced the peppers and onions i sauted the peppers and onions in one pan and heated the chicken in another since some family members don39t prefer the peppers such a winner meal
i love this recipe i use frozen peppers and onions which makes it quick i also let them defrost and drain them so the dish is not watery i consider this a quick meal and so good
we don39t eat much mexican food but i tried this recipe it was quite good i used olive oil instead of the oil listed and eliminated the cumin chile powder and red pepper flakes i would make this again thanks
my husband and i love this recipe better than fajitas from a mexican restaurant
delicious
excellent recipe made as is except for using a bag of frozen bell peppers and onions definite keeper
this was very delicious i used organic chicken breast tenderloins
this is the absolute best fajita i ever ate i like more veggies so i39ll add another pepper and some julienned onion the next time however it was totally wonderful just as written
saving this one although i only used the marinade this is a keeper i had roasted a whole chicken to use during the week i wanted to do some chicken tacos and wanted a superior flavoring for the meat i found this and it was perfect for what i wanted i mixed it up and let my chicken rest in this marinade for a bit and tossed it into the skillet to heat it up it came out soooo goooood i will be keeping this for sure thank you for sharing
quick and easy dinner my family always loves chicken fajitas and this recipe doesn39t disappoint
easy weeknight dinner
easy to prep make cook and oh so tasty
delicious and flavorful i doubled the seasoning and used one whole each of red yellow and green bell pepper and one whole onion sliced not too thin just like they do at my favorite mexican restaurant i made spanish rice to go with our meal definitely a keeper
the whole family loved it
great meal
quick and easy i39ve made this recipe three times now my family loves it definitely a recipe i will be using over and over
excellent made homemade tortillas makes it even better
deliciousdeliciousdelicious
made today but i didn39t have the seasoned salt still came out amazing family loved it it is definitely a keeper and a recipe worth repeating several times per year i actually turned on the broiler at the end made up the fajitas by placing two tortillas on a sheet of aluminum foil and preparing two large fajitas to go under the broiler just until the cheese starts bubbling they added salsa and sour cream and wrapped them up sauteing the vegetables in the remaining liquid left from cooking chicken is important cooked until they appear burnt in spots incredible
this came out great but i reduced the c umin 14 teaspoon and the same with the chili powder and added a little extra garlic and added onion powder 1 teaspoon other than that the longer it39s marinated the better i marinated it for 4 hours and used burrito tortillas also added rice really delicious 4 people each had 2 with the fixings everyone was satisfied
this came out great but i cut down the cumin 14 teaspoon and the same with the chili powder and added a little extra garlic and added onion powder 1 teaspoon other than that the longer it39s marinated the better i marinated it for 4 hours and used burrito tortillas also added rice really delicious 4 people each had 2 with the fixings everyone was satisfied
fantastically delisious so very flavorful without the crazy spice will be making many times over thank you
awesome good
we just finish dinner and i got nice complements about this fajitas i did it exactly as you say and they were amazing iserved some tortillas but also some boston lettuce leaves for those who i knew were going to have more than onedefinitely i will make them oftethanks so much
outstanding followed recipe exactly except used a prechopped fajita veggie mix from the produce aisle could not have been quicker or easier thanks
this is an amazing fajita recipe we had them last night amp my whole family loved them i made the recipe exact including red pepper flakes except i did allow the chicken to marinate over night my family used to love the applebee39s sizzling fajita skillet amp they took it off the menui tried a couple copy cat recipes amp none were that close this is almost exactly like it amp my son asked how i got the recipe from them i will be making this very often amp am so glad this popped up in pinterest for me
i39m a volunteer filed editor and i love testing out recipes the marinade in this recipe was just right we really enjoyed the flavours in this dish i cut everything up and let it sit while i got the kids from school it was nice to have the prep work done ahead of time as this allowed me to help the kids with homework right up till it was time to cook supper
hands down this is a great chicken fajita recipe i39ve tasted them before but never made them this is the first time i ever made chicken fajitaslets just say that this recipe is definitely being added to my recipe book the marinade is divine and packs a lot of flavor i didnt let it sit for 24 hours it was late so i let it sit for an hour and a half tops that was all the time i needed it was delicious the marinade was so good that i could have eaten the chicken by itself i39ll will for sure be using this marinade for other recipes as well my husband and son loved it cant wait to share this with my sisters at service
thank you for a delicious and wonderful recipe i followed the recipe to a tee but i allowed my chicken to marinate overnight i highly recommend doing so the chicken was moist and the flavors were 10 times better then any fajita packet from the grocery store my 2 yr old gobbled the chicken down and kept asking for more this will be in our weekly rotation please try this recipe and you won39t be disappointed
i made this without letting the chicken marinate because i was in a hurry and it was awesome i39m sure it would be even better if it had time to marinate for a while i usually use store bought fajita seasoning but didn39t have any so used this recipe the combination of seasonings was perfect and much better than what i have used from the store this recipe is a keeper
first time making this dish without measuring just put it all together and it is awesome i will be making this over and over and over again easy to making not time consuming i love it i give it 10 stars
i have now made these twice and they are the best fajitas i have ever made but as some have commented much better after marinating for at least 24 hours the longer the more flavorful better than most restaurants
fantastic will certainly make again and again
best fajita seasoning ever i always increase the veggies usually 34 bell peppers and 2 onionsi never get fajitas at restaurants now because they39re always so disappointing nothing is as flavorful as this recipe
like a dumb ass i39ve been using a store bought seasoning package when i came across this recipe n discovered that i have all these ingediants at home it is spectacular my picky kids ate ever morsal defanetly going to make this a regular dish
i so agree with all the 5 star ratings for this recipe it is truly wonderful the chicken is perfectly seasoned do not hesitate to try this recipe i will be making this one alot more often
absolutely outstanding these fajitas are better than the ones at my favorite mexican restaurant i made the following modifications tripled the bell pepperonion and added a coarselychopped tomato during the last few minutes of cooking the chicken i also used heaping measuring spoons of all the spices served with sour cream and guacamole salad there were no leftovers
i made this last night and it was excellent the hubby said it was better than any restaurant i made it as written except used olive oil lemon and lime juice and no red pepper flakes should39ve used them needed a little kick i charred up the peppers and onions in the broiler served with shredded mixed mexican cheeses and sour cream delish
i made this last night and will def make it again i followed the recipe but added a little bit of cream cheese to the chicken once i put it back in the skillet and wow definitely a winner recipe thanks for sharing
i didn39t use lemon or lime juice and side have seasoned salt i used adobo instead marinated my chicken tenderloins for about 2 hours in the fridge used 1 12 yellow amp red peppers and 1 12 onions sauteed low and slow for about 45 min served with sour cream avocado shredded cheese and refried beans delish super easy and a fast meal a yummy recipe
these are greatwe love them we used chicken once and then skirt steak the next time
i haven39t made this yet but plan on it does anyone know if i use olive oil if it will make a difference
amazing fajita recipe i39ve never made them before and everyone raved the chicken comes so moist and tenderbetter than the restaurants the only change i made was i marinaded the chicken all day because i was at work and not the recommended 14 hours the recipe suggested definitely a keeper
this recipe was one of the top 10 of 2015 and i heartily agree i have made it several times and it never fails my only substitution was lime juice for the lemon wonderful addition to my texmex repertoire
this was really good add some chopped coriander on top to garnish
wow these fajitas got it going on easy to make flavor is spot on i did use lime juice instead of lemon these made it in my receipe rotation for sure
this will be my new 34go to34 for fajitas i used to make a seasoning that had corn starch in it and it much prefer this one i made as is but like someone else39s post about lime juice as opposed to lemon juice i39ll give that a try next time
hadn39t made fajitas before these were very good i thought it was a lot seasoning at first for the chicken but blended well together i did add tomatoes with jalapeos to the veggies for more flavor and my husband and i like things with a little heat i did not put taco sauce on the fajita as i thought it would overpower the flavors will definitely make these again
this was wonderful both my husband and i loved this fajita seasoning the only change i made to the seasoning was to use lime juice instead of lemon juice as far as the rest goes make other or more vegetables as desired we often make fajitas so we already know we like to cook one full onion and one each of the following bell peppers red green and yellow
we love to cook amp can be selective about spicesthis combination was excellent per our preference we used bonelessskinless chicken thighs we warmed our flour tortillas on a cast iron pan until right before they toast too much to fold adds another layer of yummy flavor good enough to make for company goes together fast my only change will be to double the veggies amp onion
i have made this since it first appeared in 2000 and it is a keeper all family loves it even the most picky grandkids occasionally substitute lime juice for lemon just for a change but for the most part follow recipe exactly as written except for adding more veggies as one grandson can39t get enough peppers and onions
we all loved this recipe i used lime juice instead of lemon juice i have also used skirt steak instead of chicken i prefer the chicken but hubs liked the steak better both were very good it39s so delicious and easy that i39ve made it for friends many times one of our favorites
i have this almost memorized because i make this all the time the first time i made it my boyfriend remarked 34 if i ordered this at a restaurant i would be back the very next night34 i have made this at least 30 times and it is always fantastic this recipe is simple enough to be quick and easy and yet involves enough flavor to make you feel like you are simply amazing in the kitchen i typically double the marinade while the chicken is marinating i chop vegetables i have been adding mushrooms lately and it39s a great addition i cook the veggies first be sure to add salt and pepper then i cook chicken after marinating for at least 1 hour mix it all together and voila i love to cook all the time but this recipe has to be made regularly it39s just that good and don39t skip the red pepper cleanup is also easy it only requires a cutting board and a pan
tried this a few weeks ago and my family is asking me to make it again this recipe is super easy and very tasty it will be in our meal rotation often
quick and incredible awesome to have on hand will make over and over
i marinated the chicken a full day and it seemed to be missing something we happen to like a little more spice i agree with other reviewers that it might be better with lime but i didn39t have any i probably won39t use this recipe again
my husband just asked that i cook more peppers and onions next time my teen boys and their friend ate it and loved it also amazing they loved the slight spice that was just the right level for them
we did enjoy the fajitas but i like it better with lime as opposed to lemon and i add a sauce for a little extra zip
this is a fantastic recipe it39s super easy and the result is delicious
disappointing all you could taste was citrus not sure what i am going to do with the leftover chicken now as it wasn39t enjoyed
very good and easy to make i followed the directions except i used a frozen bag of peppers and onions so i didn39t have the prep time these were great the next day too lots of flavor
i tried this and the fajitas were delicious
i love anything fajita this was enjoyed by all
i thought i would try this for a quick and easy dinner and i am glad i did it was really flavorful i did squeeze a little lime juice on the finished fajita it just added a little extra zip
make sure you cut the chicken into thin strips to cook quicker and make making wraps easier we did not use any spice that had heat in it for 2 people it produces at least 2 different meals we put in a cut up tomato towards the end and it added great flavor
this recipe is easy and my family loves itit has become a favourite on the family menu
love this receive ez
my family loves these
delicious my family love it
this is my 1st time submitting a review for an online recipe although i use them often this time i was compelled to create a user id so i could share how well these turned out i typically find online recipes too bland for my family this one was an exception although i did add a half tsp more of every spice in the recipe and more citrus and cilantro this is a very authentic at least na authentic dish tip marinate the chicken for as long as possible
this is really amazing like made am account just to say this is good amazing additionally simple cheap and easy to modify
delicious and quick if you prepare ingredients ahead of time husband says excellent taste of mexican
i made this for dinner for my mother and me i ate it without the cheese or tortilla it was delicious i marinated the onions and peppers separately i am not sure i needed to do that but i like the added flavor i also used coconut cream for sour cream
i didn39t have lemon juice so i used cut up pineapple pieces and squeezed them in the bag threw them out before cooking because i didn39t want a too tropical flavor but next time might just cook it that way didn39t taste the pineapple at all i used 4 small breasts was delicious and one of my best meals ever
i added 15 lbs top sirloin steak and doubled this recipe and it was amazing the marinade is what makes this recipe so delicious flavorful and juicy such a great recipe
this recipe may have just changed my life i39m going to make this time and time again something so easy to make should not taste this amazing the chicken has so much flavor
fabulous recipe wished i could give it 20 stars who needs packet fajita mix if you can make this this is a keeper in my recipe bookjulie thank you so much for sharing it with us all
wonderful flavor only put in a pinch of pepper flakes because of little ones
my family and i really enjoyed this fajita recipe delicious i didn39t add the pepper flakes because my 3 year old wouldn39t eat it like that we also added black beans lettuce guacamole sour cream salsa and cheese to our fajitas
very good recipe i cut the chicken in strips after it39s cooked
fabulous
absolutely delicious i made this for myself my hubby and our 7 year old daughter and it was a hit i doubled the chicken and marinade and used whole green red and yellow bell peppers a quick simple and great meal
this was absolutely delicious i used lime juice instead of lemon juice i marinated for 2 hrs and the chicken was really tender when i threw it in the pan i know this should be common sense but be sure to mix the marinade up in the baggy before adding the chicken so it distributes evenly if you use hot mexican chili powder use far less than the recipe states super spicy i added mango slices to the pan toward the end of cooking time and added avocado and tomato on top of my tortilla mmmmm mango
i made this for my picky nieces and they both loved it everyone else did too and it was so easy to make
i will be making these all the time now delicious
my son with minimal cooking experience took the initiative to make supper one night lucky for us he found this recipe fantastic better than any fajitas i have ever had because he enjoys peppers he used a whole pepper red amp green rather than just half as suggested i39m am surprising him tomro just finished prep work and marinating in basement fridge only need fresh guacamole and a little cilantro and we39re set very happy daddy
amazing better than any fajitas at a restaurant
made this for dinner terrific just as the recipe is listed i added some mushrooms outstanding
i love this recipe i39ve been cooking fajitas using this recipe for a while now the only thing i changed is using lime juice instead of lemon it39s also easier to add the dry seasonings to the bag before adding the juice and oil it39s less messy
delicious sounding i cannot wait to make these
everyone loved this recipe i think i could have used just 1 tbsp of oil to fry the onions and peppers in though thanks for sharing
these fajitas are delicious everyone at our fiesta loved them best fajita recipe out there
hello i did this for dinner tonight it39s was delicious
this was my first time making fajitas in a skillet since i39m so used to barbecuing everything on a grill outside but alas winter has started so i needed to find a good recipe after wasting my time and food trying other ones i found this recipe and decided to give it a shot everyone loved it including my 5 and 7 year old their39s didn39t have any peppers though p i did use lime juice instead of lemon because of what i read on the comments section and it was awesome also i added a jalapeno to give it a little more kick for my hubby the only thing i would do different would be to only use half the serving amount of oregano lol but that is just a preference this recipe will be used again and again in my home
these were really very good and so easy the only change i made was to add emeril39s southwest seasoning to taste to the veggies when sauting will make again the combination of seasonings in the marinade tasted like fajitas without a prepackaged mix
great basic recipe that is easily adaptable to one39s specific tastes be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe though the citric acid will eventually 34cook34 the chicken in fact this is how ceviche is made as for freezing the chickenyes it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken however if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken the culprit is most likely a dull knife of course many of us freeze chicken but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat given a choice i would always choose 34never been frozen34 chicken and i certainly wouldn39t freeze it just to make cutting it easier
i just made these for my family huge hit we even have one picky little eater in this family i doubled the veggies because the ratio between veggies and chicken tasted off making again tomorrow
i have made these before and they are a hit every time it39s a great idea for entertaining friend too it39s fun to have everyone create their own frajitas from a assortment of toppings don39t forget the margaritas
my husband and i love these fajitas the only changes i make are to double the onion and pepper because i thought it needed more vegetables the spice mixture is good but i39m going to try doubling it for the same amount of chicken today and see if it gives it a little more flavor quick easy and delicious especially with salsa and sour cream you won39t be disappointed
it39s easier to slice uncooked boneless chicken breasts if they39re partially frozen if fresh place in the freezer for about 45 minutes before slicing the lime juice was an excellent idea
delicious
love them
very flavorful we enjoyed our dinner
very tasty lots of flavor and i only marinated about an hour
these have a perfect spice blend i never think ahead enough to marinate things so i just cut partially thawed chicken breasts and let them sit in the sauce mix just for as long as it took me to chop the vegetables worked great i also agree that lime instead of lemon juice is a wonderful swap my husband loved these
these have a perfect slice blend i never think ahead enough to marinate things i just cut partially thawed chicken breasts and let them sit in the sauce mix just for as long as it took me to chop the vegetables worked great i also agree that lime instead of lemon juice is a wonderful swap my husband loved these
haven39t tried yet
hey this is the best i39ve had my wife adores them and my kids love themi switched to lime juice instead of lemon juice before even starting it the lime is far more aromatic when cooking with a better flavor as well great recipe the chili powder and lime makes it
we love these and have them often i changed to lemon juice to lime juice and i like it even better
sooooo good i made homemade spanish rice to add into the fajitas and it was great will make again
better than any restaurant fajita i have ever had
this was my first time making this and it was so good the whole family loved it it39s been added to my recipe box
so flavorful never any leftovers
this recipe is my first attempt at fajitas and it was huge success as stated in all the other reviews they are as good and maybe better than restaurant fajitas my only advice is maybe err on the side of too narrow strips of chicken i thought i was getting them thin but not so they were still yummy just not traditional thin strips also may try in a cast iron skillet next time just because
hands down the best fajitas i39ve ever had this recipe is a keeper
i thought this recipe was awesome as did everyone else i did sub blood orange olive oil for canola lime juice for lemon and i grilled whole boneless chicken breasts vs pan frying i also made shrimp which i did saute i marinated for four to six hours seriously the best tasting fajitas i39ve ever made maybe the best i39ve ever had i didn39t try the shrimp but heard it was delicious also
family favorite
excellent recipe milder flavor with red and yellow bell peppers
ww 13 points

easy recipe and the chicken had good flavor
not quite traditional but excellent and as quick as it is to throw together we39ll be taking advantage of this great meal on a busy weeknight
not quite traditional but excellent we39ll be making this frequently
not sure quite traditional but excellent we39ll be making this frequently
very good i marinated the meat for four hours and so and it turned out to be salty enough that it left no room for taco seasoning but we added some anyway so it was a little too salty next time i will add less cumin because 1 and 12 tsps was a little too strong
outstandingas good or better than any restaurant fajitas easy to prepare
very flavorfull
this is yummy we had it just as a stir fry with some salsa added in the salsa added an element of flavour will make it again with guacamole and salsa thanks for sharing
i loved these delicious fajitas used 1 lb of chicken kept everything else the same
doubled the marinade and upped the citrus by doing a lemon and a lime amazing taste and the family loved it
this was my first time making fajitas we children loved the flavornot too spicy the chicken was tender and topped with sour cream i will make this again
great marinade i wonder how it would work to make a bunch of marinade and cut and freeze the chicken for ready to go freezer meals yum
these were so good and so easy to make was supposed to feed 6 but 3 of us devoured these with no leftovers
my family likes these fajitas for supper but love the leftovers for breakfast the next day i make extra filling to mix into scrambled eggs for breakfast
loved this this will be my goto fajita recipe from now on
really tasty recipe i had all of the ingredients on hand i will be making this one again o
absolute delish
this marinade recipe is very good i39ve made it several times i39ve even used this recipe on steak for steak fajitas it tastes really good for both chicken and steak fajitas
this recipe is one of the best i have ever made for marinating the chicken for the fajitas fantastic recipe try ityou won39t be disappointed
delicious and soooo easy to prepare loved the combination of spices
ps i used fresh squeezed lime juice instead of lemon juice too
this is a keeper i39ve been searching for 34the taste34 of restaurant chicken fajitas and have finally found it thank you
i made this with lime juice instead of lemon juice i used some of those mini multi colored bell peppers this was so good this is definitely a keeper thank you for sharing this recipe
best fajitas i have had to date
it was so good my husband love it toomrs sandra elena smith
i added black beans to the party and it was excellent i just used one large chicken breast and it lasted 3 days of constant yummy fajitas i also used some green onion and fresh cilantro through the cooking process this is a good foundation for a yummy mexican fajita
i had always wanted to make fajitas on my ownwhen finding this recipe i couldn39t wait to try it it will now become one of our favorite mexican recipes the flavor is delicious and chicken is so moist when marinating with this combo of spices i loved the lemon in ithubby said they were the best he had ever eaten i did not use the red pepper flakes nor the green onionit was perfect and i will make this again and again this recipe is a keeper
i have been making this recipe for years i make up the seasoning mix ahead of time and keep it in a sealed container i also use lime juice instead of the lemon gives it a great authentic flavor this is a recipe i use in our once a month cooking menu
i thought it was delicious my husband asked for the recipe so he can make it at the fire station the only thing i changed was using lime juice instead of lemon juice because that is what i had on hand excellent recipe
made the recipe exactly as written but also added beef strips my family loved these fajitas and said they were the best i had ever madea keeper
i love this recipe i make it at least 2 times a month it is quick and easy and we all love it
i added some rice and avacado to my fajita it was delicious
my family and i love the chicken fajitasthat was the first time i made themmy 3year old even said goodit was the first my 66 year old grandma even ate a fajita i told her i was going to make it like toro loco and she said she never even ate their so i was very pleased when she injoyed her meal i also made spanish rice and homeade refried beans i will make it again it just might become a regular dish
my entire family loved this recipe we all love peppers and chose to add 3 or 4 peppers rather than the 1 pepper that is recommended we also prepared the peppers by roasting them in the oven first and then peeling them then added them to the onion mixture we also grilled the chicken so we did not cut the chicken into strips until after it was cooked
this is the best chicken fajita recipe that i39ve tried i sub 1 teaspoon salt for the seasoned salt and i use olive oil instead of canola oil everyone that has tried these raves about them
this is a old recipe i got from taste of home years ago and have been making it ever since i moved and misplaced my recipe and found it a few months later and was so happy if you try it you will love it do not change anything it is perfect exactly how it is
this was very good will put it in the keep file
i love this recipe i marinated the chicken overnight though and it had a terrific kick to it i also added lettuce to the add on choices thank you so much for sharing this
our family liked this recipe even my daughters that don39t like peppers
fantastic flavor you don39t even need tortillas just eating it plain is absolutely delicious
wonderful quick recipe this one39s going into the tried and true file
i make these all the time but made a few changes from the first time i made them i felt they were a little bland so i revamped the seasoning to 2 tsp of cumin and 2 tsp of garlic powder and replaced the green onions with sliced red onions and 2 peppers the color of the peppers depends on what i have on handtry yellow and orange peppers too if you want to get rid of the after eating peppers burps try this after slicing your peppers in strips soak in water for a few minutes and then drying your peppers with a paper towel then cooking i can almost guarantee you won39t be burping peppers all night
i have tried many fajita recipes and i was always disappointed until now this one was great only change i would make is to cut back on the salt
i make these all the time thanks to this recipe my 2 toddlers are eating peppers and loving them i like to make a huge batch of the seasoning up at one time to have on hand this recipe also works perfectly if you want to make a freezer meal kit just slice the chicken and put in a freezer bag you could even make up the seasoning marinade and pour into the bag before freezing then slice up the peppers and onions and put in a separate bag when it comes time to cook just defrost the chicken in the fridge the peppers and onions can be cooked right from the freezer one of my top recipes from taste of home ever love love love this
my family loved it i will definitely make this again
i really like this recipe i admit that i used to use packaged seasoning mixes because i couldn39t find a recipe i liked the seasonings in but this was awesome
delicious we loved the leftover chicken in salads the next day excellent seasoning combinationall ingredients i had on hand thanks for the recipe
this chicken fajitas recipe is one my family has enjoyed for many years the is also good on a salad
this is an excellent recipe i did modify it a little i cut up chicken breasts into strips and placed them in a crockpot i then added the rest of the ingredients except for the peppers and onions i cooked it on low all day i also sauted the peppers and onions and then placed them in the crockpot about an hour before eating needless to say there wasn39t much left over thanks for a wonderful recipe
yum
my husband and i think this is as good as the mexican restaurants in our area if not better
i could not believe how good this was and it39s so easy i had all the spices in my pantry for the marinade and always have lemons on hand this is definitely a keeper i39ll even make this for company sometime too
awesome recipe better then mexican restaurant chicken fajitas
loved this recipe the only thing i did differently was double the marinade mix meat was tender and so flavorful
great recipe definitely a keeper
my husband and i love this recipe i use more peppers red yellow and orange and onions the last time i made these my husband said that this is his favorite meal that i make he said he would love to have them once a week i usually serve spanish rice or refried beans with them great recipe julie
my boyfriend and i love this recipe it39s so easy to make and even if i forget to marinate the chicken the night before it39s unbelievably flavorful in just an hour two wonderful
this was so good the flavor was perfect i didn39t have fresh peppers and onions so i used a frozen blend and they ended up pretty limp so i will use fresh next time but it still tasted great super quick and easy too
this is one of my family39s favorite dishes they taste great
excellent flavor i39ve made this many times
my husbands and i favorite dish this is definitely a keeper to pass down to my children
instead of using chicken for this recipe i used a butterball apple wood smoked turkey since it was fully cooked i kept the sauted peppers red amp yellow and onions in the pan and added the turkey to heat it up this was sooooo yummy
my husband says this recipe is better than any he has eaten i have made it time and time again best flavor
very good but i decreased the amount of seasoned salt to 12 tsp the 2nd time i made them and the recipe turned out a lot better
i was really excited when i saw this recipe because the seasonings made it look like it would be perfect seasonings were very similar to lawry39s fajita mix which i think is very good unfortunately i was quite disappointed if i were to make it again which i will not be doing i would definitely add more green amp red peppers probably a total of 3 peppers in all for the 1 12 pounds of chicken
i just add a little crushed red pepper flakes one red and one green pepper we love it
awesome
very good i didnt add the red pepper flakes cause i dont have 39em but it was still delicious
this recipe was great but spicey i will make this a lot but without the red pepper flakes even my kids loved this
we love this recipe the chicken also freezes very well just combine oil seasonings and chicken per the recipe and freeze in the resealable bags it finishes marinating as it thaws and makes a wonderfully quick dinner
pi made this last night for dinner and everyone really liked it i liked that it was so easy i didn39t have lemon juice so i used lime instead i will make this again for surep
this recipe is a favorite in my eighth grade family and consumer education classroom we marinate the chicken over night to reduce prep time on foods lab day
i enjoy all of your recipes i will try this one
i loved this recipe i say got changed can someone help me out it was so thick this time i made it and i hate ginger so there definitely was none in there before whatever changes got put into this anybody have the original recipe from before cuz it was the best apple pie ever had
this apple pie is amazing i added other ingredients to it like coconut and it was so nice
this is a very good basic apple pie recipe as with any recipe tweaking may be needed to suit your personal tastes and reading the directions carefully is also mandatory when reading reviews i noticed several folks complaining about their pie being underdone then saw one lady who said she had to add time to the initial 25 minutes when the recipe specifically calls for an additional 2025 mins after foil is removed i suspect more than one person undercooked their pie by not reading the recipe correctly
love this recipe always turns out delicious my husband love apple pie thank you
this recipe by far is out of this world my first time making apple pie i made it last night and it turned out so delicious we love love love it i did used variety apples as indicated from the helpful tips i added a little little more dough than requested by increasing by 12 more since i love thick crust and for filling i have added 1 teaspoon of allspice to give a unique taste baking time took longer for the extra thick crust by 810 min thanks for sharing this recipe and the great tips very helpful
really good pie filling recipe my first time making an apple pie i only had honeycrisp and golden delicious apples so i used those came out great i did cheat and use pillisbury refridgerated pie crusts i made it on wednesday night and didn39t cutserver it until thursday thanksgiving day it was perfect
perfection
i had lots of apples left from a recent visit to a friend39s orchard so i decided to make a pie found this one through a google search and it looked good i used half ambrosia and half ginger gold apples i think granny smiths would have been better it was still very good just a little sweeter than i would have liked
use granny smith apples pie came out perfectly except make it sour
making this apple pie for the second time and i love it i live in yakima washington and its apple season here i usally don39t bake but this was so easy to make and simple i did use a little bit more sugar than it asked for in the recipe
i used foraged 39wild39 maine apples perfect amt of sugar
perfect i baked it longer but may have had more filling
this is pretty much how i make my apple pie but i like the idea of using brown sugar also it39s a lot easier to use a potato peeler to peel the apples nice recipe
delicious used 9 large apples and doubled the sugarspice and it made 3 regular size pies
well if i want a sweeter pie i thought i39d use gala apple39s but my mom said that the texture is different and that gala apple39s would most likely fall apart so maybe in the future i39ll try that by the way love the recipe so good i used store bought so good but i39ll try homemade next time
i made it with store bought pie dough still was delicious and easy love it thank you
i thought the presentation looked very delicious the ingredients are easy to use and find
i needed to use some golden delicious apples before they went bad never have attempted a homemade apple pie used this recipeoh my goodness i am hooked it is so good
made it as a tart using half a pie crust loved this so simple recipe
this was delicious and i even skipped the white sugar due to heath and latent food allergies i limit my sugar and i can not use sugar substitutes has anyone else ever altered the recipe i think i will try it without any sugar next time also can anyone recommend a tool that helps you figure out the nutrition value this way i can see the grams of sugar based on my alterations thanks again grandma knew what she was doing
i love this recipe the pie was delicious and so easy i did use a ready made pie crust which worked out great
best apple pie filling the apple slices were crisp not soggy the recipe was easy to follow and the advice was a plus my friends gave the pie filling rave reviews this will be the one i use for now on
this filling added tablespoon brandy and teaspoon vanilla but did everything else as directed this filling recipe is our favorite coupled with a butter and sour cream crust delicious
we love this recipe it is the only one i use for apple pie now it has never been runny for me either but i also do not cut into it right away
this is the 4th time i have made this piecomes out perfect every time
i made this pie today and it is so good i didn39t add ginger or nutmeg it wasn39t soupy at all i think that comment was very nice at all thanks for the recipe
this is probably one of the easiest apple pie recipes ever i have been baking almost my entire life usually using my mom39s recipe after she passed away i was unable to replicate it but this is darn close i only use granny smith apples i use less sugar and brown sugar slightly less than half a cup per pie a bit more cinnamon about the same nutmeg and flour i skip the ginger as i don39t think the pie needs it i don39t care for a pie that is too sweet so i am pretty liberal with the lemon juice i might add a teaspoon more of flour depending on how crazy i went with the lemon juice i generally don39t sugar the crust but that is my preference i made two apple and two pumpkin pies for thanksgiving this year and needless to say there were no leftovers to those that have a problem with the filling being too wet i suggest using extremely crisp granny smith apples the peel should be dark green if the texture of the apple is 34mealy34 it is over ripe and will probably be too wet thanks for this great recipe and the lovely memories it gave me of baking with my mom
i can39t figure out why this is getting less than 5 stars it was amazing not wet or runny at all i used a double crust store bought and 5 granny smith apples i followed the recipe as written scratching my head about these other reviews it turned out fabulous
this isn39t pie this is soup i don39t know if the creator forgot to add a step or what but my finished product was more liquid than apple if this is 34grandmas34 recipe she must have had soft teeth recipe should be removed
first off pie taste bad however all this talk of grandmas special apple pie is disingenuous at best the pie came out with a lot of liquid i like a nice wholesome and crispy apple pie not a wet apple pie this pie is grandmas wap wet a pie
this was a great classic apple pie it did come out looking wet but you have to let fruit pies cool before you cut them i let mine cool overnight and it was perfect the next day no run off and no soggy bottom for those who say the apples tender you need to test the pie by sticking it with something to make sure they are soft before you take it out if your crust is getting too brown put on a pie shield or foil
made this pie for thanksgiving dinner i should have read the reviews i have made many pies this was the absolute worst i have ever produced i used my normal crust recipe with this one for the filling like the others my crust looked beautiful but when we cut into the pie it was a mess of undercooked apples with a ton of runny juice it never set up this recipe needs to be removed it definitely does not work the way published you guys should be ashamed of it readers should not have to tweak your recipe in order to make it work remove please
i really enjoyed making this pie today it was sweet and spiced just right it made a hit with the family and was truly a snap to make i did cheat by using a good quality frozen crust i beat my egg white nicely and brushed a good bit all over the crust and then gave it a generous sprinkling of sugar my top crust was made by using a maple leaf cookie cutter stamp and just covering the entire top of the pie with leaves i just love how pretty it makes the pie just beautiful for fall this recipe is a keeper thank you
recipe sucks there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pie even with a lattice top
i made this apple pie and everyone loved it so i made several more and its so easy my friends asked for the recipe i love this apple pie
toss the apples with the lemon juice then the sugars to coat then cook in large skillet to start the cooking process and reduce the liquid med heat toss frequent cover to cook apples after 10 look at the liquid add the flour table spoons at a time tossing as you go if tighten up take off heat then add to ready pie shell bake as before
this was my first foray into baking an apple pie i39ve done lots of different cakes pies and cupcakes but i39ve been a limited intimidated with the apple pie well my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so it was the right time to just go for it i chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward i did read through many of the reviews which are very mixedfrom best pie to worst pie honestly that made me a little nervous but i decided to remain positive and give it a shot the result was spectacular i had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy he said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a 2nd even bigger slice i took the next slice and i was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how well everything came out i will note that i followed the directions without any changes i used only granny smith apples and i didn39t have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough the pie39s taste is amazing i thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly honestly the hardest part for me was making the crust which i also decided to do for the first time i was actually worried most about the double crust but it somehow all worked out phew i would definitely recommend this recipe it39s worth taking a chance
i39m with most of the posts about this recipe being runny and apples were not done very disappointed feel like i just wasted my time trying this recipe maybe this recipe is for confection ovens idk but i won39t use it again something is wrong in the instructions
recipe is nice it taste great but the filling is very liquidy and came out like soup even after cooking longer and resting for an hour was disappointed but taste great
this is my first time baking an apple pie and i used storebought crust i combined this recipe with a recipe from martha stewart and i used bits of both i had heard about cornstarch being a great thickener instead of flour and i39ve been experimenting with it lately it39s a great way to make sure it doesn39t come out watery i used extra sugar and just under 2 tablespoons of cornstarch i didn39t even need to use the entire thing spices sea salt ginger nutmeg cinnamon white sugarand cornstarch mixture i noticed a lot of complaining in the comments about undercooked apples so i cooked everything together first and the cornstarch did its job to create a thick sauce right from the getgo it just finished baking so i39m at the cooling stage now i added milk cream and sugar to my egg wash and used it on the bottom crust to help keep it from being soggy as well as heating a baking sheet for it to cook on i39ll edit if i remember thanks for all the help from the comments
wish i had read more reviews it was awful i baked it 20 minutes longer than indicated and still the apples are not cooked the filling is liquid i used a mix of honeycrisp and granny smith i39ve been baking for 45 years but am looking for a no fail apple pie it was a beautiful pie unfortunately it was inedible a huge waste of an afternoon
this is the best apple pie filling recipe i39ve ever used i have learned to cook my filling until apples are half doneso the 34juice is less runny and your crust doesn39t over brown before the apple filling is done since finding this recipe i always volunteer to make the apple piesbecause no one else i know can make an apple pie as good as this one thank you for the recipe
this is an amazing pie i actually look at reviews before baking and actually kinda shocked to see them lol i did follow the recipe to a t yes i will admit the pie is a bit liquidy at first but after a half hour there was no more liquid pouring out taste wise amazing you can taste everything perfectly maybe a little to much cinnamon but thats preference baking wise it did take a little bit longer than said but if you just keep your eye on it and put foil around places that are getting to brown come out beautifully either way would bake again saving the recipe
a doctor it up a little bit less sugar and a scoosh of nutmeg i bake and give away and told this is the best apple pie ever
i made this pie last night and i have to say it is the best recipe i have ever tried it was delicious and will now be my new 34go to34 apple pie recipe
worst apple pie filling recipe ever i followed the instructions exactly and after an hour of cooling i cut the first piece i had to drain more than a cup of liquid out of it i39m so upset flavor is also lacking i cannot tell you how disappointed i am with this recipe
excellent recipe i added a few things and tweaked the sugars i also highly recommend using more than one type of apple for better flavor i use macs cortland and granny smith makes for great flavors
i did the recipe to the t because i saw a review complain that everyone tweaks the recipe and reviews their version rather than the original recipe and they are right so i followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious i will critique it though ginger was a little too strong especially paired with the nutmeg it truly over powered the cinnamon taste it definitely came out liquidy however i found when you let it cool for about 45 mins the liquid becomes less runny i used a pillsbury pie crust phenomenal i did set up the pie crust and the sugar mixture first then sliced the apples up and mix together to avoid letting the apple pie filling become to watery really change anything but the pie is truly delicious without adding or subtracting any ingredients
you should use milk not egg white to brush on the pie crust pie crust edges do not need to be covered with foil until the end if browning too quickly time given is not long enough to cook the filling it needs twice as long as stated here it also needs a higher starting temperature it should be baked at 425 degrees for the first 20 minutes then turned down to 375 degrees to bake for a further 40 minutes or so also i used bramley apples and it came out a bit tart so increase the sugar and also the flour and it is liquidy
lovely recipe for those who had issues with soupy pie or apples that did not cook up try making sure that you are using a baking type apple as opposed to a 34snack variety34 they are not successfully exchanged
is there an egg substitute we can use for the egg whites also if we use heaping tablespoons of flour it will prevent the filling from being too watery right just want to confirm
i have made this pie at least five times and each time i get rave reviews my grandmother and mother said its the best apple pie they39ve ever had i do cook it a little longer to make certain the apples aren39t crunchy delicious
really yummy only complaint is that like other people the pie had soooo much liquid in the bottom no biggy though i just poured the liquid out carefully next time i would use more flower of cook the apples a bit first the taste is great though i used a bit less ginger just because i was afraid it would be too overpowering and it turned out good will make again
mine came out super liquidity and my apples were still crunchy i have to bake it again the flavor was okay
was pretty good but small tart apples was awesome i love it
this is the first apple pie i39ve ever mad and is seriously one of the best apple pies i39ve ever tasted i followed the heaping tablespoon suggestion for the flour but all the other directions as is i believe i39ve made another dish better than my motherinlaw and she39s been making her pie for well over 50 years my husband was pleasantly surprised
omg this was an amazing pie i have made so many things for my family and me and this was by far their favorite thing i39ve ever made i read the reviews before and used heaping tablespoons and it worked out great i didn39t measure out my lemon juice i honestly just poured whatever the apples needed d i actually really liked a little bit of that lemon flavor i would recommend some more some cinnamon but i really love cinnamon so that39s your choice lol i used a premade frozen pie crust and as you can see it worked out great ovbiously i had to buy some more to get the top covered i recommend to not be shy with the egg whites i brushed all the egg white on the top and i39m glad i did i thought about not using all of it but i did and got a great pie all in all this was the most awesome pie ever so glad i found this recipe lt3
this pie was delicious it was the first homemade pie i ever made but the recipe was easy it included items i usually already have in the kitchen and it didn39t take much time to prep however i only had gala apples which made the pie perfectly sweet but not too sweet i didn39t have any ginger so i missed out on that intended kick the recipe included the top layer of my crust was still raw after 25 mins so i added 13 more minutesit was then half undercooked so i added 10 more minutes and adjusted to 400 degrees maybe i had the pie on a rack too low in the oven all i know that in the end it was delicious
a 14 year old baker and always wanted to make an apple pie but i always thought it was too hard i found this recipe and i was astonished by how easy it seemed this pie came out so well when i made it my whole family loved it so i already made it twice in the last week this apple pie recipe is so good and very simple to make i will definitely continue to make this pie for the rest of my life
i recommend this recipe the pie had a lot of juice left at the bottom but the pie was still dry i followed the recipe exactly and it looked good until i tried it too much cinnamon and nutmeg and my apples were still crunchy
this was the second time i used this recipe thos time i used granny smith39s rather than red delicious and the pie came out much better since it wasn39t overly sweet the ginger also adds a nice touch
this pie is amazing i like pie but my family doesn39t really care for it my daughter received a school assignment to bak an apple pie so this is the one we chose i only made one change i didn39t have any cardamon so i sprinkled i a pinch of allspice instead the pie took longer to bake than directed but the end result was worth the wait i found the taste of home pie notes listed right after the recipe helpful and also followed one of the the reviewer39s recommendations to use heaping tablespoons full of flour the pie wasn39t runny or dry it was just perfect the only change i will make next time is to add another cup pf apples i used 7 cups of thinly sliced honey crisps but they cooked down quite a bit my daughter has declared this the only pie she likes and my husband refused to let me take a couple of pieces to my parents he wanted the leftovers for himself
i39ve not tried this yet but i would like to know why lumps of butter were put inside please
best apple pie i ever made i will say one thing i put heaping tablespoons of flour and it came out perfect after reading a review saying they heaped the flour i decided to do that it came out perfect thank you taste of home my family was so thrilled with my pie
it really looked delicious i wait to try it thank you
this pie was delicious after reading the reviews i decided to make the tablespoons of flour into heaping tablespoons and the pie turned out perfect will be making this one again
i made this pie last night followed the recipe exactly used gala apples and it came out perfect great pie
first time making homemade pie and it39s delicious very easy to followthank you
please be respectful and limit comments to only the recipe and advise others do not attack another39s character with with profanity baker2 keep in mind that many have never ever baked before
laughing at all those who realize that you cannot cut into an apple pie fresh out of the oven great recipe
needs a thickening agent i let this pie sit for over a day and a half and it was still way too runny had a decent taste but the cinnamon and nutmeg was a bit over powering
i do not recommend this recipe the cooking times are way off and there was so much juice in the pie i had to dump most of the juice out
update to earlier post i did not use ginger nutmeg only bc none on hand still 5
for those complaining about the juice that comes out of the pie right when you take it out normal you have to let it rest like the direcrions say so it can jellify so yes gavin you threw away a perfectly good pie dab
very quick and easy i usually use 56 small apples to make 9inch pie crust
this was terrible it looked good when i took it out of the oven and when i cut into it a ton of liquid came out i was so excited to make the pie and ended up just throwing it away would not recommend
my pie turned out beautiful and then i cut into it full of liquid and overly sweet such a disappointment
i have a ton of apples and decided to make apple pie always heard granny smith apples make the best pies it turns out because tart apples have the most pectin and other apples can make your pie soupy lesson learned either use granny smith or allow apples to macerate and release juices prior to baking watery or not the pie was still delicious
best apple pie i39ve ever made and i have it on good authority two experts at eating apple pie a grandson and a neighbour
very bad recipe pie turned out horrible baking time and oven temperature are way off
these recipes look great awesome to see so many delicious recipes in one place
a classic treat followed the recipe exactly except for the egg wash and sugar on top of the crust at the end
best apple pie ever
amazing
awesome great recipe and i believe that the 12 c sugar means white sugar because i don39t know of any other sugars
the amount of white sugar isn39t listed on the recipe this info would be helpful
i have never baked a pie before but this came out amazing i use any ginger and only used 2lbs of apples witch i recommend i also used macintosh apples they were a tad bit sour but over all it was very delicious
outstanding used granny smith apples got rave reviews from all folks at the campground i didn39t have nutmeg and forgot to add the butter oh well still awesome taste and texture the next day definitely a keeper to make again with homemade vanilla ice cream yummy
second time makingfirst time too much liquidi used my canned applesdrained all juiceput extra cinnamonexcellent will continue using this simple recipe
way too much ginger and nutmeg in this recipe i even had more apples than called for and it was overpowering cut back the cinnamon and just add a pinch of the nutmeg and ginger let the apples be the hero
i think the recipe is delicious i noticed some of you found it soupy not that i am an expert but i think some apples have more juice in them then others maybe if you are using an extra juicy apple you will have to add a little more flour just a suggestion
i have been baking this recipe for years and love to experiment with a combination of different apples when available here in namibia the only time i have been disappointed is when i did not bake it long enough now i always check for the clear syrup to bubble out of the vent before removing from the oven great flavor and very easy to make
this apple pie is has amazing flavor the only reason i give it 5 stars was the fact it turned out a little soupy and the apples stayed really firm however because it tasted so good everyone loved it next time i make it going to try cooking the apple mixture a little before putting it into pie shell to try to thicken it up a bit and soften apples a little this recipe is definitely a keeper
hos tl make the pie crust at home
i left am earlier review and forgot to add that i halved the white and brown sugar my family and i have health issues so i had to tone the sugar down but it was soooooo good thanks for sharing
very easy to make thank you
best apple pie i have ever tasted just the right combination of ingredients i followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it was really excellent everyone i shared the pie with agreed it was the best i loved the story about your granny that was just the best i will forever think of her everytime i make this pie which will be often
followed the recipe to the letter pie looked great on the outside but was a soupy mess on the inside i will not make this again and i do not recommend it
extremely tasty had some liquid inside but was delicious otherwise
made this for thanksgiving and it was a hit will be making for christmas
came out like soup with 1 tbs of liquid the apples get soft
best recipe used in a long time
this recipe turned out great i just made it for thanksgiving i did add an extra tbsp of flour as other reviewers advised and the results were not runny at all or dry also for the sugar i let my half cups measures be slightly short and it didn39t turn out too sweet also for the ginger instead of powder i used paste and slightly more since its fresh i used 4 granny smith and 2 honeycrisp apples the results were fabulous i39ve made apple pie in the past using recipes found here or there and the flavor was always missing something i39m not sure if it is the use of ginger or that i use ceylon cinnamon but this recipe is a keeper
this was a hit i left the sugar the same but used about 9 cups of sliced appleswe like our pie deep dish
what kind of crust do i use
wonderful pie
the pie is tooooooo sweet use less sugar
i39m going to make this for xmas but i will have the amount of sugar
this is a wonderful apple pie recipe best i39ve made ive seen some reference to the pie being soupy i didn39t experience that at all we let the pie rest for a few hours after it came out of the oven it was perfect when we sliced and served a la mode of course
so at first the pie was soupy when i took a slice but the flavors were amazing the pie sat in the fridge all last night and all day today it still looked soupy were the slice was taken i took another slice andno more soup this recipe is great thanks for sharing i
very good apple pie recipe i lost my cookbook that i had for 30 years which contained my apple pie recipe i had an idea of all the ingredients i needed but wasn39t quite sure on the measurements found your recipe and it was fabulous i love the use of all 3 spices and the brown sugar thanks for sharing this recipe it39s already in my new cookbook i39ve started
this is by far the best apple pie i have ever made and eaten i think it is the brown sugar instead of all white sugar whatever it is it is fantastic
i have been making this exact pie for many years but in my recipe i have 14 tsp cloves instead of ginger which i do prefer i like my pie mildly sweet so i only add 14 cup each of the sugars i find the apples have a good amount of there own sugar even granny smiths i also blind bake my bottom crust i find the crust become soggy this way this is an excellent recipe thx maggie
every hood and tastu
the best apple pie i have ever eaten
i tried this recipe for the first time today it was the easiest way to make a delicious apple pie i will never have to buy a apple pie again i will continue using this recipe thank you so much for sharing it
i love this pie and make it often found that thinner and consistent apple slices are best and you have to let it cool completely up to 2 hours to avoid soupiness i also like to do an open weave with the top crust which may allow for extra evaporation lastly i cook it for about an hour total 30 with foil 30 without
this pie was a soupy mess i even followed the advice of another reviewer and reduced the juices and sugars of the apples before assembling the pie also the apples were very thinly sliced and did not cook through after 50 minutes of baking when the crust was done the flavors were very good but the way it baked up was unacceptable especially for so much work i39d be less disappointed if i had used a store bought crust and saved the time and effort will not make this again
best apple pie recipe that i39ve ever made everyone loved it
flavorful and delicious
for a pie novice like me this was an easy recipe to put together the taste of apple mixture was good my problem was that the apples were a little too soft i cooked the pie the amount of time stated in the recipe maybe i sliced them too thin or i overcooked it how thick should the apples cut i used 7 cups of granny smith apples i am a better cake baker but this was a marvelous start to perfect cannot wait to try it again my husband said it was good never the less
it39s a good recipe i opted out the ginger just because i39m not much of a ginger fan i used 6 granny smiths apple and 1honey crisp it was alittle too tarte next time i39ll use another honey crisp apple and less granny smiths wish i could add a picture
wonderful the best apple pie i have made in a long time i think the added brown sugar really made it good i made one today for company and my husband is already asking me to make another one it looks like apple pie will be served at thanksgiving dinner as well
fabulous and what a pie
great recipe i used 6 cups of apples and 4 t of flour and it was perfect i used granny smith apples thanks for the recipe it is my new go to recipe for apple pie
i made this pie today and it turned out very nice but next time i39ll skip the ginger about apples if you live in an area that has fresh picked apples you are very lucky apples after being stored lose moisture and this will cause your pie to be dry unless you add a little fluid or less flour used fresh picked granny smith 4 and only 2 honeycrisp because they were huge and so sweet and tart too all in all this 85 year old man is glad he found this recipe
for a novice pie crafter i and my coworkers raved about this recipe easy and unnaturally deliciousi used granny smith breaburn and jonagolds for two pies just enough tart and sweet and bulk for pie filling i39ll keep this for other times when apple pies are called for
no hassle apple pie recipe cooked to perfection
delicious pie i used my favorite goto homemade pastry dough recipe for the crust i used 4 granny smith apples and 2 honeycrisp apples that combination was perfect for us just the right amount of tart and sweet tip for all if you dont want runny pies heres what to do mix your fruit with your sugars and lemon juice let sit for at least 30 minutes dump the juices that have been rendered out into a small sauce pan boil it gently for about 510 minutes to form a syrup you can add a teaspoon or so more of sugar at this point to thicken up your syrup if needed let it cool slightly then add it back to your fruit and sugar mix well then add your flour this works every single time with every kind of pie you will not have any more runny pie filling thanks for sharing this great recipe
followed this recipe to the 39t39 beautiful pie knife blade pulled dry in 30 minutes cooled pie and found it had about 34 34 of juice free in the bottom of the pie was a soggy mess
wow being a lover of apple piei was always intimidated to attempt to bake onewell i got brave tonight and i went for itthis is the best apple pie i39ve ever eaten in my lifeand i made iti love taste of homei39ve made some delicious meals from the recipesthis one i39ll be making for years to comeabsolutely delicious
this is the perfect apple pie i used my own pie crust recipe though because it is tried and true two tips abou the pie filling 1 i used a combination of jonagold and granny smith apples but increased the amount of apple to 9 cups this was just right for the stated amount of sugar flour and seasoning juicy but not runny 2 baking time needs to be increased substantially i started with the stated time but the pie was not nearly done baked another 30 minutes checking frequently to be sure it was not over baking apples should be nice and 34oozy34 and very tender with these two minor modifications fabulous results
overall i like the recipe like others i think either a little extra flower or some cornstarch would be good to help soak up some of the juices that might vary based on the top of applemy crust turned out great but even with 5 extra minutes my apples still weren39t tender enough i used honeycrisp and a few golden delicious i wish now that i39d either tried another reviewer39s tip of covering the whole top with tin foil so i could have baked it longer or perhaps cooking the apples in a sauce pan for 5 minutes to give them a head start ps i probably would have chosen jonathans or jonagolds if my store had them
i39m not a usually a fan of pie but a lot of people in my family like it so i decided to make it i listened to the other reviewers and added an extra 12 tbsp of flour and i added a little extra cinnamon because who doesn39t like extra cinnamon anyway the pie came out perfect it had fantastic flavor and wasn39t very runny
apple pie is my husband39s favourite but i rarely make it yesterday i picked up a 2 pack tenderflake crust and made this for him it went over well i did omit the ginger preference but next time i39d reduce the nutmeg a bit tooi found it a bit too sweet but that may have been because i used gala apples and they were quite sweet i39d like to try it with granny smith next time
we just moved into a house we bought and it had apple trees don39t know what kind they were but the sauce did not thicken up my crust was good does it matter what kind of apples i used i cooked it longer then what it said any suggestions for next time
the best apple pie i have ever tasted my homemade crust was pretty good also
fantastic pie i use 1 tab cornstarch w 2 tab flour i don 39t like nutmeg so i use all cinnamon
very good just a bit too much nutmeg though since we don39t really like it i39ll try cloves instead next time
wonderful recipe the only thing i did different was leave out all spices since i love the taste of only apples i also laid a piece of foil over entire pie first 25 min then uncovered and finished baking 2530 min until apples are tender when pie poked with thin knife
this is my go to apple pie recipe so easy and so delicious love it
i wish there was a higher rating then five stars this was my first homemade apple pie and it came out the best i39ve had in my life and that39s not just because i made it haha there were a few different changes i made and that is 1 i used the homemade pie crust recipe off of crisco container 2 i skipped the egg white and made a melted butter with sugar and cinnamon to brush on before baking i know it39s not the healthier choice but it added some great flavor to the crust 3 i substituted the flour for tapioca because my grandmothers secret is it adds a little extra sweetness and flavor also i forgot to set the timer and didn39t read the cover with foil part so i accidentally skipped out on that so it was uncovered for about 45 minutes apples weren39t mushy but also not hard right in the middle i used janigolds and mitzu apples that we picked at the orchard
awesome piereminds me of home in the fall playing outside as a kid down to my grandmothers smelling the pie mixed with the ocean breeze salt air spruce trees and a homemade apple piecannot beat them three smells together along with the waves crashing the beachahhhhh wish i was back home in maine
this was the best apple pie i have ever tasted in my life i made it exactly as written so simple and nobody believed i made it thank goodness my daughter witnessed it thanks so much
excellent flavorused granny smith applesthey are my favorite
only one thing i didn39t go covet the pan first the sticks at the bottom
i made it exactly as written it turned out excellent
i couldn39t find any egg whites or some of the other ingredients but it turned out perfect none the less i might be only 14 but this was very simple and exciting it was the first thing i39d ever made on my own adding extra butter made it even better sometimes accidents make things better i used a wholly wholesome gluten free crust because i have celiac
great recipie
this recipe is fantastic i would not however add much extra flour i took the advice of some previous reviews and used 5 tbsp flour instead of the recommend 3 tbsp and the pie filling was too sticky next time i will use 34 and it should be perfect
i loved this recipe it was simple and just what i was looking for i loved the sugar on top of the crust i used pink lady apples the perfect combination of sweet and tart
i have found the apple pie recipe for keeps my husband and 29 yearold son were drooling over this pie i used granny smith apples4 tablespoons of flour not one drippy run didn39t have nutmeg butused a little pumpkin pie spice and cardamom in addition to cinnamonand ginger i used trader joe39s pie dough and i39m telling you it is utterlydelicious
only 6 more days before my husband deploys and an apple pie was on his list of wants i have never made an apple pie before and was scared this would be a big flop to my surprise this is the best apple pie i have ever tasted glad i could make this for him thanks so much
i made this pie for my very first thanksgiving with the inlaws luckily i tried the recipe out a week before thanksgiving i made the first pie exactly like the recipe says to it turned out very runny but tasty nonetheless i then made another pie with the suggestions of other reviewers i upped the flour to 5tbsp and used a little more brown sugar than granulated i was also stumped on which apples to use so i went to my local market and grabbed 2 of each they had i ended up with gala honeycrisp and sweet tango omg this pie was absolutely splendid thank you to everyone who submits a review so newbies like myself can bake something as easy as apple pie
my very first apple pie and it was delicious
wonderful i made this w my daughter it was simple to make and delicious to eat yum
awesome tapioca to thwart the runs winner also no ginger don39t like
this was my first apple pie i39ve ever made my family and i loved it great flavor wouldn39t change anything it39s perfect
great like it says it39s pretty runny but i just put it in the fridge overnight and it was perfect
my suggestion to stop runny juicesprinkle 23 tablespoons of instant tapioca put some on bottom crust some inbetween and finish with a little on top when juices are bubbling thru slits in top crust tapioca will thicken this as it cools delicious
was disappointed in the runniest of this pie had to use several paper towels to sop up runny juices did not read reviews before putting top crust on would suggest taste of home rewrite recipe it for sure needs more flour on the upside has a good flavor we used honeycrisp gala macintosh and some sort of fancy apple just disappointed it was runny
good flavor but very runny
i never write reviews but this pie was awesome it was quick and easy to make and had the perfect combination of spices also for those of you who were wondering you39d need about 5 regular sized applesthe only thing i would change is the sugar it was a bit too much for my family i would cut one of the sugars in half also i did not listen others and increase the flour but it may have helped the runnyness it was not runny per say but could have used a bit of extra thickener lastly i made this in a regular round metal cake pan with the same cooking time and it worked out great thanks for a lovely recipei used criscos no fail pie crust recipe
i used all granny smiths which weighed 297 lbs the spices and sugar amounts were right on actually perfecto sliced apples real thin about 116 inch or so increased flour to 5 tblsps consistency of cooked mixture was very nice my supreme critic wifey said she would have used a couple of macs or fujis thought a couple of apple slices were a little hard though she gobbled it down first time for me with a two crust pie will add a fuji or two in the next attempt with this wonderful recipewhich will be soon with ice cream maybe perfect on its own i used a 3412334 crust recipe listed on the net excellent and easy pie crust recipe
i made this for a pie auction at church and it had the room buzzing the winning bidder told me later in the week that it was fantastic
may i request the complete recipe for the double crust
this was the best pie ever easy to follow and easy to modify to own tastes less sugarthank you
followed the recipe word for word i let the pie cool over night but it was runny the flavor was great though guess i should have listened to other reviews and added extra flour
this recipe is awesome simple and easy to follow directions
this was fabulous thank you for sharing
i never thought to put ginger in my apple pie pumpkin pie sure but never apple then this recipe came along and showed me another way it39s so yummy it seems like an insignificant amount but the ginger really adds some zing
loved this it39s beautiful to look at and so tasty too
fantastic made this for thanksgiving dinner this year after family agreed they wanted an apple pie the filling set up perfect so cut like a dream i loved the spice and sugar levels was just perfect will be adding to my goto list of desserts
i had to use orange juice instead of lemon and i added 12 cup blueberries it was a great recipe
am i the only one who cannot see what temperature to bake this at
excellent flavor everyone loved it
easy to follow recipe very easy prep amp we baked a perfect home made apple pie the entire house smelled wonderful i highly recommend this recipe for the novice baker along with accomplished bakers as well we were very happy with the results we used a mixture of granny smith apples and fuji apples it was beautifuland tasted just as great highly recommend for anyone who wants to impress their family with a gorgeous homemade pie ps it was just as good cold the next day or even reheated in the microwave i felt proud of our efforts sincerely mrs vance
so good and i even forgot to dot with the buter before adding the top crust rave reviews from entire family
i made this pie the taste was excellent but it was so runny i went back through recipe to see if i missed anything but i hadn39t any idea why the apples were soft but still in shape
i forgot to click on the stars to rate this recipe when i wrote my review i give it 5 yummy stars
this is the first dessert our guests grab at our labor day barbecue i bake 2 of these delicious apple pies and they are gone almost as soon as i put them on the table
i make this pie with soft white wheat flour and replace the sugar with succannot everyone loves it and we don39t have to feel to guilty i have made it for church and it is always gone
this is a very easy apple pie and delicious i use orange juice if i don39t have lemon it is a good pie to make an impression if you are a first time pie maker the pie crust from a box is tasty i have made this apple pie recipe a few times
my first apple pie amp my lifelong recipe be sure to cool completely before slicing i used this filling in empanadas amp wontons too
this will be my new goto apple pie recipe it39s great i used all granny smith apples and added two extra tablespoons of flour as recommended here by some and it came out perfect i served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce and it was a huge hit
excellent taste totally worth trying definitely a classic
i39ve used this recipe for the last two thanksgivings and it comes out great i read the reviews and decided to scoop the apples out of the large bowl instead of pouring them that kept the pie from being too soupy this recipe is a keeper
this is an amazing apple pie it is yummy and reheats very well a big hit at our new year39s eve party will repeat recipe for the next familyfriends event highly recommended
i39ve made this pie twice now and it was delicious both times one variation that my dad remembers from his childhood is to use an oatmeal crisp on top rather than a second pie crust i used the crisp recipe from this site 34winning apple crisp34 but made the rest of the pie as directed on this site covering the entire pie for the first 20 minutes incredible
made this pie for thanksgiving was going to make a pumpkin pie but then my soninlaw gave me some apples so made this one instead and everyone loved it
i made this pie for thanksgiving dinner it was great will make it again
i made this recipe for thanksgiving and found it to be the absolute best apple pie i have ever tasted thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe
instead of all tart apples i used granny smith buabaum abd fujie apples and increast the cinnimon to 1 12 teaspoons turned out fantastic
i lost my mom39s recipe and tried this one it was easy to make and had great flavor my fiance went back for a second serving so i know it was good
my review didn39t show the 5 stars i gave this recipe so resubmitting
i made this at the spur of the moment for company today i had the pie prepared amp in the oven in less than an hour i used the silicone pie crust protector that i got from the shop taste of home web site amp it worked great my pie turned out perfect amp the only thing i will change next time is i will bake it just a tad longer or maybe at a slightly higher temp as i am at a high altitude
this turned out great family loved it and like another person i forgot the butter too it was still great with out it would be really good with homemade whip cream
i get asked for this recipe all the time
i made the apple pie today came out ok i read the other reviews several cooks said they added additional flour to thicken the mixture i used granny smith apples so they don39t produce a lot of juice so i didn39t need the addition flour that is required in with more juicy apples i did find the pie was a bit too sweet my fault again i should have tasted my apples
i maid this for my brother and sister in law but as i was putting it in i realizedthat i forgot the butterthey said that it was the best apple pie that they ever hadi still think that it could of used butter
i add some oatmeal to absorb some of the juice
so good and so easy my husband loves it so it is definitely a keeper i used green apples since that was what i had on hand and they were delicious
truly delicious i39ve found my favourite pie recipe
i also use the additional 3 tablespoons of flour i also normally use two or three different kinds of apples this is by far our favorite recipe
very good first apple pie i madedefinately will make again
this is the first apple pie i have made and it got rave reviews i went by the recipe using 7 cups of apples i used half gala and half braeburn and sliced them pretty thin i found the pie to be a good consistency not runny at all even after cutting the filling does not run out in the empty area
made only one of these pies for thanksgiving i cut it into tiny slices so that none would be wasted by my grandchildren and greatgrandchildren only those who were at my house first got any my son who does not care for sweets ate about half of the pie his son who does not like apple pie ate two slices of it and loved it the rest of us got a sliver of it and wanted more i made it with splenda in place of the sugar as my husband and i are diabetic needless to say i am making at least three or four of these pies for christmas i am sure there will be none left over
made this recipe today to take to friends39 for dinner she39s diabetic so swapped out the sugars for splendas amp added 5 t of flour got 2 thumbs up it set up beautifully everyone loved it better than my mom39s amp i didn39t think that was possible definitely a keeper
this pie filling is the best i have ever hadand i didn39t use a regular pie crusti used the pie crust from the dutch apple pie recipeto die for
this is the first applie pie i have ever made and i recieved many compliments from iti did additional flour as the reviews had saidone family member actually said that it tasted just like grandma39s pies used to that is the best compliment anyone could give me i will definatley make it again
i never made an apple pie before so this was my first attempt everybody loved it in fact i39ve made this 4 times in just 2 weeks
i made this recipe for the first time on thanksgiving this year i had read through the reviews and i added 3 tbs of flour to the dry mix after tossing the apples there was still some mixture left in the bowl which i proceeded to sprinkle evenly over the apples before placing top crust it came out great it was my first time making apple pie myself and this was as easy as can be i will definitely make this one again i did not find it too sweet at all but i will try different apples with it as the granny smiths i used were really tart the sweetness is a matter of taste thank you for sharing this recipe
way to watery
this was a great recipe and really easy to make i used granny smith apples it was a little sweet but by reading other reviews maybe i will add a little mor flour next time yum
all in all it39s a good pie the 5 stars deceived me though it39s way way way too runny i should have read the reviews in addition checking the star rating so if you39re getting ready to bake this pie do not dump the coated apples onto the pie crust under any circumstances unless you like apple pie soup
i recently went to an apple festival in nc i had never made a pie before any pie and wanted to give it a try i used honey crisp apples from grandads farm and a pie crust recipe from this site i carefully followed all directions absolutely wonderful
loved it and so did everyone that tried it great thank you
wonderful pie its the only recipe ill use
made this tonight and the flavour is amazing i did add extra flour to thicken as well will probably add more next time perhaps an extra 2t also added a couple of sprinkles of watkins apple pie spice kids probably would have eaten it all if i had let them i may reduce the sugar a tad next time but still enjoyed just the same
i just made this apple pie today and it came out wonderful that39s saying a lot because i am not a big fan of apple pie i added a tiny bit of clove because i like that flavor great recipe
we loved the pie after reading the reviews i did added 3 heafing tablespoons of flour to thicken the pie came out great i served the apple pie for dinner with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top
as a member of our local american legion i often donate baked goods to our monthly steak nights what says america more than homemade apple pie this recipe is super easy and delicious will definitely make again and again
this pie is great everyone loves it everytime it isn39t too sweet for me to avoid it being runny scoop the apples out of the bowl instead of dumping them into the crust that way any leftover mixture that didn39t coat onto the apples will remain in the bowl a recipe
i39ve never made a pie before and i used this apple pie recipe as my first attempt and it turned out great yum
over and over and over this is by far the best apple pie recipe i have found
very good recipe didn39t last long at my house
this is a great recipe i added 8 cups of apples and 2 tbls of butter next time i would add 14 tsp of ground cloves to add a little zest to it it came out soupy but i let it sit overnight and it was fine i will be making this again for sure
my favorite apple pie recipe sometimes i add a little pumpkin pie spice as well just to spice it up a notch
its awesome but my came out runny even though i followed directions exactly and let it cool for 2 hrs
family favorite
very good recipe very easy to make and tasted wonderful i also added some caramel syrup to it yummmmm
love this recipe i used ready made pie crust by pillsbury other than that i stuck to the recipe it was a big hit with my family so easy
it is a tad bit sweet so when i make it next time i will cut down the sugar some otherwise it was fantastic
i decided to make it today after reading the reviews but it was extremely sweet i won39t make it again
this is sooo good
yum yum this pie was very easy to make and very delicious
perfect apple pie recipe this will stay in my recipe file forever
tasted just like apple pie should yummy
apple piewow so yummy i added 12 tsp of apple pie spice to the rest of the ingredients it was great thumbs up on this recipe
this pie is very good classic apple pie
i cut up the tortillas to layer in pan instead of leaving whole so it is easier to cut or spoon out of dish and i used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut calories
excellent recipe i used corn tortillas
will this feed a family of 6 that eats like an army
everyone liked it even my picky eater gave it a 410 which is pretty good lol the kind of recipe you can adapt to your tastes and addsubtract things i followed the recipe except i used corn tortillas and fried them as others suggested and i found the bottom too hard to cut so follow the instructions and put them in uncooked i also added green onion as a garnish
made as written except added hot sauce to beef used whole package of taco seasoning and split between meat and sour cream used extra cheese and put lettuce and tomato on side so everyone could add their own only reason is for reheating left overs was yummy quick and easy
big hit in our house i use corn tortillas and leave out the italian dressing because it39s not something i keep on hand have already made this three times and it39s on the menu again for this weekend the whole family loves it
i39m always surprised when someone changes a recipe and then rates their own recipe if you want to give the original recipe a rating you39ll need to actually make it as it was written
made this with only 4 lowcarb tortillas ricotta cheese instead of sour cream had more of that added shredded cheese to each individual serving used a turkey breakfast sausage for meat had on hand cut calories
i thought this was delicious and my whole family agreed i did read the comments before making it and saw that one suggested using more taco seasoning which i did and was thrilled with the outcome i left out the italian dressing and cilantro and we were out of tomatoes and lettuce so i did tweak it quite a bit but it ended up amazing we will definitely be making this again
we39re not great fans of beans so i put a small can of corn and a grated zucchini in the ground beef mixture instead i didn39t use the italian dressing and i used my own version of taco seasoning with garlic powder sweet smoked paprika and ground cayenne pepper i served lettuce tomato and chopped onions salsa and plain yogurt on the side makes it easier to reheat leftovers we all really enjoyed it
i love mexican food this looked so good but tasted sooooo disappointing i wondered about not adding an entire package of taco seasoning should have went ahead and added the whole thing the flour tortillas were a mistake toojust mush and blah it really taste like an enchilada casserole at all it had potential but just a huge fail taste wise
fabulous and tasty easy to make my kids wanted seconds followed the recipe
very easy and my husband and son loved it
this was a hit at my house i used corn tortillas that i fried didn39t add the italian dressing but did add 5 garlic cloves and 1 jalapeno to the hamburger while cooking just the right amount of heat for us
very quick to make and quite tasty thanks for a great recipe
this was simple and easy to fix my whole family loved it i will be making this a lot thanks for a great recipe
so easy and delicious we like a bit of heat so i added red pepper flakes to the beef and onions and mixed in some pickled jalapenos slices to the finished mixture before baking to spice it up a bit will definitely make it again
super quick and easy family meal entire family loves this recipe and even great for leftovers we prefer the flour tortillas it many have recommended corn if a fan i did not add the sour cream as my son and his dad hate it it still turned out fantastic definitely printing out a copy for my recipient books
great recipe everyone loves it and it39s easy to make i39ve tried the recipe using flour tortillas and with corn tortillas both ways are good but my family prefers it with the corn tortillas
what a great recipe came together quick and my whole family loved it would be a very easy recipe to accommodate to your family39s personal tastes
so good even my picky eaters loved it
oh my goodness this was good i didn39t have any ground meat but i had leftover brisket and it was perfect
basically followed original recipehowever we preferred a bit more lettuce tomato etc this is fun because you can make little adjustments to your family39s liking and it is still amazing sorry but even a little 34mushy34 i don39t see how it would ruin the taste or make it gross if it boiled over in your oven and you used a 1134x734 pyrex it is because the recipe calls for an 1134x1734pan usually things boil over if your pan is too small or your oven cooks too hot my family thought it was greati thought it was nutritious hidden and we had fun all making it together
my husband and i like it because of the flour tortillas should use corn tortillas he thought bottom tortillas were hard from the baking i had leftovers next day and the tortillas were mushy pretty gross also it bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven the last 510 minutes uncovered in an 11x7 pyrex
oh so very good the leftovers were even better i highly recommend
great recipe my family loves things cheesy so i added more cheese and sour cream
i change out black beans for pinto beans and omitted the clintro as we don39t care for it
i added a diced bull pepper and a half can of rinsed corn and use cumin or the dressing because of the other reviews where people said it add to the flavor of the meal it was awesome i also used probably three cups of cheese and it was almost quesadilla like very delicious and different for basically tacos or burritos my five kids ate every bite
loved this recipe made it for my husband39s poker buddies they gobbled it up i did use more sour cream than called for but that only made the dish more creamy used a little more mexican blend cheese than called for i did add the italian dressing and didn39t see that it altered the dish adversely i will definitely make this dish again served shredded lettuce chopped tomatoes guacamole and extra salsa on the side also served a corn salad which was made ahead
i loved this recipe the flavors are great i made this exactly as stated and wouldn39t change a thing
i have made this several times and it never disappoints i generally buy the burrito size tortillas since one will fit nicely in the bottom of my round casserole dish i then place half the burger mixture on it and layer it with one more tortilla and finish as directed so easy and quick to make
i39ve made this twice i think i used corn tortillas the first time and liked it better than with flour i used about 1 12 cups of cheese instead of just 1 cup and my family thought it needed more cheese next time i will use less cumin and will leave out the italian dressing someone mentioned 3 layers of tortillas i39m pretty sure it39s just 2 layers i placed 1 tortilla in the middle and tore the others to make them fit i ended up only using 5 tortillas
this was a perfect recipe for my son to make who is learning to cook he did it all himself following the well written directions it really was a tasty dish and the presentation was lovely son was quite proud of himselfeven took a picture to email a friend i told him he will have to fix it again for cinco de mayo thanks for sharing
i used corn tortillas instead of flour omitted the italian dressing i also added a can of refried beans and stirred the sour cream in meatbean mixture
i made this for a neighborhood gettogether and it was a big hit i will definitely make it again i had 8 tortillas so i made a third layer i also had ground elk and used it instead of beef it has very little fat i used 2 cups of cheese thanks for sharing
wow quick and easy and so good i thought the italian dressing was an odd addition but i think it adds to the flavor i did however leave out the black beans picky kids
left out the italian dressing used corn tortillas did not use enough i only made one layer of torn tortillas next time i would use more since i suspected there weren39t enough i sprayed tortillas and baked them the last 5 minutes of the casserole so we had chips i added refried beans along with the black beans and stirred in greek yogurt instead of sour cream i also used ground turkey instead of beef we loved it
since it39s the first time i made this i followed directions exactly as written made no modifications it was good but the italian dressing clashed with the rest of the flavors and i didn39t care for that bit will make again and omit dressing
great casserole everybody loves it we typically make this dish for families with new babies or people who have had surgeries etc and we always get asked for the recipe it39s delicious
super easy to make great taste family loved it
excellent dish i39ve made it with ground beef turkey deer and today i used elk i also make homemade tortillas another taste of home recipe just to make it as healthy as possible thanks for sharing
we love this i did lightly blend the salsa and onion because the kids don39t like the texture i mixed the sour cream together with the meatbean mixture and used more cheese about 2 cups
delish added retried beans no italian seasoning even my kids loved it will make again
i completely forgot to put the italian dressing in however it was great easy to make and we will definitely have it again
enjoyed this very much i left out the italian dressing i just forgot it i think and used small corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas i thought it came out a bit dry so i might add more salsa or some enchilada sauce next time the whole family scarfed it down
halved all ingredients and omitted italian dressing my husband and i loved it one serving left that we will have to fight over
favorite
we liked this and i did leave out the italian dressing becsuse i could not think of a reason for putting those flavors in a tex mex dish also used refreid beans and pepper jack cheese instead of the mexican blend
faimly and friends loved it
i omit the italian salad dressing extra salsa used used a can of refried beans as well as the black beans good chance to get the extra vegetablesfiber my family needs
weweewe
my kids love this recipe it39s a huge hit at our dinner table
we really liked this dish i used corn tortillas instead of the flour for the beef mixture i used refried beans instead of the black beans and also added green chiles and corn i didn39t have mexican cheese so i used sharp cheddar this is a very versatile recipe so using the suggestions of others worked well i will definitely make this again thanks for sharing this recipe
bottom layer hard to cut thru overall good flavor
this had good flavor but using flour tortillas made the layers too thick and hard to cut and eat if i make it again i will use corn tortillas
this recipe tasted great it was also really easy to make i did use 2 cups of the cheese instead of 1 because it just didn39t seem like enough even though that added a lot more calories next time i might try saving the sour cream out and putting it on top
love this casserole i add a layer of refried beans and jalapenos very good
this was delicious and so quick and easy to make with simple ingredients this is a keeper
use corn tortillas for a real enchilada texture flour tortillas get soggy
my family loved it
excellent
i liked it but my husband and son did not i think the three layers of tortillas made it hard to cut through and the leftovers were soggy
quick and delicious
this is an excellent recipe i substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and i used hot taco seasoning mix my family loved it
i used a can of mexican stewed tomatoes instead of salsa and added a can of corn and some diced jalapenos it was delicious new favorite
easy like the ingredients ok taste
new family favorite
excellent i omitted the sour cream amp italian dressing because my husband isn39t a fan of those foods it still came out moist amp tasty this will certainly be a repeat dish jalapeno39s would be a good addition for extra kick too
my family and i really enjoyed this meal it was easy to prepare and i will definitely serve it again
i take this to potlucks and everyone loves it i use black bean and corn salsa just wonder how long to cook it in a crock pot
i didn39t make any adjustments i love it and friends and family love it just as it is
wonderful delight
a hit with the family hubby i and 12 year old and 4 year old needs to be doubled as the four of us ate the entire dinner in one sitting with only one helping of leftovers left which the children fought over for lunch the next day super simple to make too
turned out really well it is a wonderful dish
we really liked this recipe easy and delicious
delicious i left out the dressing because i didn39t have any i took this to a ladies39 dinner at church and didn39t bring home a single bite everyone raved about it i added a little salsa to the bottom and mixed the sour cream in the meat mixture as others recommended easy and delicious i can39t wait to make it again
excellent and easy to make i thought the 400 degree oven temp excessive so i baked at 350 degrees for the specified time also spread a little salsa on bottom of casserole dish no burning or crisp tortillas this dish is definitely a 34keeper34 next time i will kick it up a little by adding some green chiles andor chipotle chiles in adobe to mix
instead of the black beans i used refriedbeans and layered each tortillaalmost like a mexican lasagna
i have to tell you that the first time i made this was in mexico my mexican friends loved itdeveras if you are finding the bottom too crisp then spread a little salsa in the bottom of your pan first i always make it in a round casserole pan that accommodates the size of the tortillas i use if there is anything leftover the taste is even better the next day for lunch i serve with hot salsa on the side to accommodate all tastes
we liked it
this is an awesome recipe quick and easy cilantro sets it off thanks
definitely went back for seconds
good recipe and easy to make next time i will try throwing some jalapeños on top as well since we love spicy food
great recipe wonderful flavor going to try with ground turkey next time for fewer calories
good recipe will make it again love the cilantro and i also mashed half of the beans and added a little more sour cream
very good and tasty will be making this again soon
wonderful recipethis is a keeperwill make this again and again
i haven39t made it for awhile but think i put a little salsa on the bottom of the pan to keep the tortillas moist i mashed up the black beans the 2nd time i made it so our youngest gs wouldn39t find the beans he loves the casserole when the beans are mashedwouldn39t eat it the 1st time because he found a whole black bean amp announced he 39doesn39t eat beans39
i39m giving 4 stars only because my bottom tortilla got too crispy to cut which made it messy i also substituted pintos for the black beans great flavor but may try cutting tortillas into strips as ceannze mentioned
recipe was wonderful family loved and they are tough critics
wonderful recipe easy to make and something different
this was the entree for tonight39s dinner and it was well received i left out the italian dressing as i39m not a fan of it anyway but it was excellent i put the recipe in my 34favorite34 recipe box too what do you think of tearing the tortillas in pieces instead of placing 3 down and 3 layered with the meat mixture
i just made this dish tonight and wowthis is a keeper like others i also added the sour cream in the meat mixture
made this tonight and it was delicious very simple to make will be making again in the near future
great easy to make very good love this recipe
my family loves this recipe i use ground turkey and add the sour cream to the mixture i also add a can a corn 5 stars
super quick and easy and my family loves this recipe i use ground turkey in stead of beef the only other change i made was stirring the sour cream into the sauce mix after removing from heat this recipe is a real keeper
my family loves this recipe i make this all the time a real keeper
i had ground beef i had to use last night and decided to make this for dinner i usually don39t have high hopes for casserole type dishes but this turned out to be outstanding my husband said it39s one of the best things i39ve ever made it39s on the dinner rotation now thank you so much
loved it subbed pepper jack cheese for mexican blend super simple to throw together a bit messy but who caresit tastes great
very good i think i would double the tortillas though but over all it was great
love it and very easy to make
making this recipe again tonight and can39t wait it is so easy and so amazing love it
great flavor we39ll be adding fresh jalapeno to the toppings next time for a little more kick
my husband and i didn39t like this recipe it had an aftertaste that was unpleasant i think from the italian dressing
used turkey and only 4 tortillas wonderful
made this for dinner last night huge hit actually made it for dh i39m not a big fan of mexican food and guess what i went back for seconds awesome only thing i did different was added a can of chopped green chilies to the meat mixture we like spicy dh said next time he wanted guacamole with it i agreed thanks for posting
i made this for my oldest ds39s family kids from 3 to 7 i did make some changes didn39t have any taco seasoning or cumin used 1 tsp chili powder instead and used shredded cheddar instead of redfat mexican cheese blend nor did i use cilantro of the 7 of us that ate it 6 of us loved it amp the 3 year old strongly objected to the black beans amp refused to eat it
i used corn tortillas and turkey top with guacamole r new family favorite quick easy amp healthy
very tasty recipe i love the southwestern taste so what 39s not to love about this recipe made as written with the exception i did not have any fresh cilantro so i used dried
this is easy and my husband said it is very good i will definitely make it again
my kids loved this i added the sour cream to the meat mixture to save time and to make sure the sour cream was evenly distributed
everyone in our family loves this recipe and it has been become a regular for us i have made is per the recipe and also made a version where i changed the sour cream for nonfat plain greek yogurt and it tastes the same love this
i added rotel tomatoes and salsa so i think that made it too runny good flavor but it was a like a dip instead of a mexican layered dish
i made this according to the recipe and we all loved it however the tortillas wouldn39t fit in a 2 quart casserole so i used a 9 x 13 the next time i think i39ll try corn tortillas as we like that flavor in our mexican meals
i have made this many times for all types of people amp i have never had anyone not love it it39s a regular part of of the menu when my husband amp i cook mexican for corporate events amp my husband is mexican it is my teenage daughter39s top request
this was awesome will definitely make again
this was so tasty that we ate it until all of the leftovers were gone i tried it with the cilantro for the first night but it was too overpowering so left it and the italian dressing off and it was sooo tasty making it again tonight
was impressed with this dish we have added it to our list of 34keepers34
as soon as i saw this on the cover of the magazine i knew i was going to try this my whole family loved it it is also very easy to make i have made it several times always make as written
this was a winner with my familyeveryone loved it i didn39t include the italian dressing just because i didn39t have any on hand still very good
this was excellent and so easy would make it for company or potluck
my family really liked it for a 4 and a 5 year old it was perfect
i39ve made this twice the first time i added the italian dressing and it was terrible tonight i omitted the dressing and although it was much better it was missing a little kick next time i39ll try hot salsa to see if that helps
i had decided to try this meal out since there were a considerable amount of good ratings and boy am i glad i did it is delicious my family scarfed it down there were no leftovers and the price was descent definitely will be added to our 34family favorites34 list
amazing my family loved it i have forwarded this recipe on the about 10 other people as well definitely a keeper and will be making this alot thanks for sharing
this was so good everyone at the table was making yummy noises adults kids and toddlers all gobbled it up and went back for seconds i didn39t have any leftovers will make this again for sure
this is a wonderful recipe i do substitute corn tortillas instead of flour but that is just our preference i love that this is a healthier version of other enchilada recipes i have everyone in our family loves it
yummyeasy perfect as is
i made this exactly as is written with the exception of the taco seasoning i used a fiesta dip mix 1 t not 2 as directed from tastefully simple otherwise exactly as written and this is amazing my grown children were home fro supper and want the recipe and took the leftover home with them served a salad in a small tortilla shell baked into a bowl and some spanish rice beautiful dinner good enough to be served to anyone

i made this with the flour tortillas and they were soggy slimy and did not taste good we ended up dishing out the 34filling34 which was good and not eating the tortillas at all if i were to make this again i would use tortilla chips instead
tried this tonight and really enjoyed it my husband loved it i39m a little hard to please but i followed the recipe exactly except i added a layer of salsa to the bottom before i put down the torillas to prevent the dryness everyone was talking about as well as leaving out the onion because i don39t like onion and felt the salsa would have plenty and it turned out delicious it went together so easily and i will definitely make this again
i tried a recipe search for enchilada casserolecouldn39t find it also went thru several pages of the thread what39s the recipe thank you
excellent dish and so easy modifications i used corn tortillas covered bottom of casserole wsalsa used kidney beansmixed sour cream into meat mixture but also added cream cheese since i didn39t have enough sour cream the results no left overs three teens and a picky 11year old all devoured it my youngest doesn39t even like casseroles mexican and beans however she loved this dish will make this a family recipe keeper thank you
my whole family loved this
i39ve recommended this to several friends and colleagues and made it for my family many time everyone loves it this deserves more than five stars
my husband did not like this and i would use corn tortillas instead of flour
very yummy i did not use the dressing and subbed out the sour cream for cottage cheese i used the sour cream for a topper instead will definately be making this one again
i make this often for new moms who just had babies it39s a nice change from the usual fare for them warningthis can be pretty spicy so i have toned it down esp for nursing moms by using mild taco seasoning and mild salsa o it39s always a hit and it39s easy too
i thought the flavor was good but it didn39t end up looking like the picture the next time i make it i will add more layers of tortillas so it has more consistency overall a good filling meal
even my very picky 6yr old son liked it
this recipe is amazing and i will definitly be making it again my kids liked it too but it was a little spicy for them so i think i would lessen the taco seasoning next time i also think it looks funky with the sour cream baked in it so i think i would leave that for a topping after it is done
my husband and i loved this recipe the only thing i changed was using corn torillas instead of flour very very good
fantastic i used nonfat plain greek yogurt very yummy kids love this
my husband absolutely loved this it39s so easy and has wonderful flavor plus it serves so many or leaves lots of leftovers
my family loved this i did make some changes and additions instead of salsa i used rotel instead of flour tortillas i used tortilla chips and i also added refried beans this was fantastic and a definite keeper thanks
we didn39t know what to make for dinner last night and discovered we had all the ingredients for this so we tried it it was a little too spicy for our 8 yo but still a definite 34keeper34 this may be my husband39s new favorite diabetic friendly recipe
family loved this and have requested it again very easy and yummy
this was fantastic everyone that39s me my husband and 5 picky kids all loved it it was easy to make and came together quickly i did add sliced olives to the lettuce topping and i used regular cheddar cheese other than that i followed the directions exactly and it was great thanks for a great recipe
this was very good and hubby agreed i39m making it again next week
this recipe is really good i changed it up a bit i used ground venison and made my own italian dressing i also doubled the recipe and used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans i disagree with most of the people on here about this recipe being fast and easy i started it at 5 and by the time i was done with all the chopping it was 7 definitely a weekend meal
next time i39ll leave out the italian dressing it gave it a sweetness that i felt was out of place and i39ll use more beef and less onion between the salsa and the whole onion it was just about too much but in general a good recipe
this was delicious my husband loved it i didn39t have black beans so i used kidney beans which were very tasty would definitely make this again
easy enough to do and very tasty
my husband 34hates34 casseroles or so he thinks but i had to try this recipe because to me it sounded wonderful he absolutely loved it it39s been less than a week and he39s wanting to know when i39m preparing it again my only differences from the recipei only keep whole grain tortillas on hand but they worked great and i forgot to pick up fresh tomatoes so topped it with salsa and for anyone considering leaving off the lettucedon39t some crisp shredded romaine topped it off perfectly my husband ate 3 of the 8 servings that night at dinner perfect recipe
great and super easy recipe we are going to try it with shredded cooked chicken next time thanks for sharing
awesome meal will definitely make it again the only thing i did differently was use burrito seasoning instead of taco
this recipe is a family favorite even my picky 17yr old nephew loves it i have made it several times the italain dressing is a great addition there are never any leftovers it is also quick and easy
my picky eater devoured this casserole he complained about being too full it is on my list of make agains it is very easy
love it yummy and easy to put together the tortillas are the first part of the layer in aswering dvilands question what tortillas is your preference i myself dont care for corn tortillas at all and use flour wheat tortillas are good to
my husband and i loved this easy and hearty casserole
the entire family loved thisit is awesomewill be making again very soon
i find this recipe confusing the instructions call for 3 tortillas but they are not listed in the ingredients are the tortillas all added to the bottom of the casserole or are they layered with the filling between the photo looks like there are two layers of tortillas i have not made the recipe but would like to try it
everyone i serve this to loves it
it was horrible the italian dressing does not belong in a mexican casserole it overpowered all the other flavors even the dogs wouldn39t eat it
i have not made this yet but i do not understand why recipes for enchilladas use flour tortillas corn tortillas have so much more flavor and texture i will try it with corn tortillas
this recipe is one of my family39s favorites wheat tortillas work great too and make the dish even healthier
the family loved it will make again
this was a tasty meal and my family enjoyed it the only thing i didn39t like was the tortillas that were on the greased edge of the pan got hard and basically inedible but overall it was a good meal i think the mixture would also be good inside a burrito
very good everyone liked it
my husband and i love this dish it39s not to hard to make and i follow the instructions as is except that i call it mexican pizza instead i cut it out like pizza slices and the taste is amazing
this was a quick and easy recipe and it was deliscious we will definitely make this one again
this was fabulous my family gobbled it up so quickly will definitely be making this again thanks for the wonderful recipe
this is easy to prepare and very tasty
this was great my kids loved too
super easy and tastes incredible i will be making this dish often
i add green chilies and mash 12 of the black beans and leave the rest whole i also use corn tortillas and fry them in olive oil before layering to add texture to the dish
my husband and i love this recipe easy to make and very tasty
very tasty i added corn and some ranch dressing
switched the beef out for ground turkey it was amazing
i am vegetarian and made this with textured vegetable protein it turned out great and was delicious the husband ate it and until i told him there was no meat in it he didn39t even realize
okaythis wasn39t my favorite recipe ever but it satisfied a major mexican food craving tonight i made it with corn tortillas and the flavor was good worth making i think i39d prefer even a bit more cheese next time gooey is good
great flavor and easy to make my whole family loves it
quick and easy makes for a wonderful weeknight dinner when you have kids with sporting events or other things going on i also like to add green chiles to spice it up a bit

big hit in my house easy to make i used ground turkey and nobody new a thing tastes awesome
i really thought this was going to be better based on all the other reviews maybe it was the kind of black beans i used or the type of italian dressing but my family didn39t love it i may try this one again just because i love anything with tomatoes or cilantro

i39ve made this twice now and will be making it again and again i use soft corn tortillas for a more authentic enchilada flavor and double the cheese the contrast of the cool lettuce tomato and cilantro topping is fantastic be sure to use a very sharp knife to cut the casserole as the bottom layer of tortillas can be a bit of a challenge to cut neatly

loved this recipe even though i found it in the comfort food diet magazine it still seemed a little heavy i made some substitutions i used 93 lean ground turkey instead of 90 ground beef used the entire 125 lb package instead of the 1 lb of ground beef called for in the recipe since i didn39t want to freeze the extra 14 lb by itself i like italian dressing so used 13 cup v8 juice instead of ¼ c it dressing next time i will boost it to 12 or 23 c if i use the extra gr turkey again cut the number of flour tortillas to 2 per layer instead of 3 results in 8 ww points plus for 8 servings

i love mexican dishes and it is often difficult to find ones that my wife will tolerate the cilantro and the subtle flavor of the dressing made this a meal that she will most likely let me make again a dollop of sour cream would have probably made it even better

loved it i used 12 chunky mango habanero salsa and 12 standard hot and the texture was great not runny at all i usually make my own taco seasoning and just mixed in some chile powder cumin oregano cayenne saltpepper and fresh garlic i also added minced serrano pepper i did make a couple minor substitutions shallots instead of onion and monterey jack instead of mexican cheese the only problem was i ate way too much i think next time i39ll try corn tortillas and maybe add a can of corn

i made this recipe for a group of friends although i did exclude the italian dressing and 1 cup of the salsa but it was a very big hit i made one casserole with lean ground beef and one with chicken i shredded and was suprised to find the chicken went over better with all the exact same ingredients it also cut very well after cooling with the excluded ingredients not messy or sloppy at all

not sure if anyone else commented on this but the meat mixture makes an awesome chip dip this is our second time having this i made it with 15lbs of ground beef skipped the onion bc we use chunky salsa added half a bag of sweet corn for crunch mixed in the sour cream and used a whole pkg of taco seasoning i was so hungry that i had a taste on a tortilla chip and we actually ate it like that for dinner put some in a bowl topped with shredded cheese and voila as my 4yo says 34delicioso34

my husband absolutely loved this he usually doesn39t say things are good until i ask him what he thinks this time he took one bite and said it was really good i did what some of the other people did i put some salsa on the bottom of a 9x13 pan instead of layering the sour cream i added it into the meat mixture much easier to spread around

this was so good and even great heated up the next day for leftovers i didn39t go the lowfat reduced sodium way and added a bit more sour cream one addition i made was to mash up an avocado and spread it on the first layer of sour cream before the second layer of ingredients quick amp easy so i am sure it will become a regular at our house i let it set about 10 15 minutes before cutting it and the pieces came out perfectly

loved it however i did what several other reviewers suggested and used corn tortillas instead to keep the tortillas soft versus 34grainy34 i cooked them in a little canola oil for about 15 seconds each and drained on paper towels i know this totally added to the calories but we don39t like the flour tortillas because they become soggy i did use more cheese probably closer to 2 cups jalapeño jack and cheddar other than the extra cheese and corn tortillas i followed the recipe exactly as written i have to say that i always viewed lettuce and tomatoes on these types of casseroles as 34optional amp pretty garnish34 but it is a must for this casserole almost tastes like a taco salad thanks so much for the recipe i was really tired of making the same old ones i39ve been making foreverkarla

i made this for supper tonight with a few modifications i used lean ground turkey instead of beef i didn39t have any italian dressing so i used catalina other than that i followed the recipe we had our salad as a starter instead of on top of the casserole it made for a very satisfying dinner my husband loved it mine didn39t look like the picture tho39it was quite runny even after sitting the five minutes but i will definitely be making it again

signed up just to review very easy to make even for folks like myself with limited cooking ability whole familly loved it and asked to make it again
my dh absolutely loves this the first time i made it as written and he was smitten i39ve tried multiple variations with italian sausage and pizza sauce with taco meat and salsa with pepperoni on top and he always wants me to go back to the original soi have a pan of the original in the oven right now thank you for a great recipe
pretty good nothing fancy but certainly tasty i think next time i39d go a little lighter on the cheese add some extra zucchinisquash and play around with some spices or a little more imaginative of a sauce also i39m having difficulty understanding where the similarity to pizza is imagined to be all that said i liked it plus as a concept ie squasheggcheese based it39s a great way to use up the tons of summer squash from the garden
just made this the other day and it was a big hit i like that the zucchini is baked as a crust before adding the rest
and once again i forgot to put in my stars this is a 5 star recipe all the way
my daughter who absolutely hates zucchini loves this recipe she says i should make it once a week lol
this recipe was really good the only substitution i made was using ground venison
we need a good substitute for the eggs thanks
excellent the only thing i added was italian seasoning when i cooked the italian sausage
we recently made a switch to lower carb eating this was really good and anyone who knows me knows how much i intensely dislike zucchini i spite of that i made and enjoyed this dish and will definitely make it again
i39m always looking for ways to hide the texture of ground beef and tried this we really liked it and i39ll make it againespecially since i have about 30 yellow zucchini sitting around and no freezer room
we thought this was great i did change a few things though i used the suggested italian sausage ilo ground beef i also used pizza sauce ilo the tomato sauce we like green olives and mushrooms on pizza so i added those to the italian sausage mixture it was wondereful
scrumptious what a great way to use up zucchini from my garden i plan on making this recipe again and again thank you for this fantastic recipe
this is excellenta big hit i did use paesana new york classic pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce because it39s my favorite i just eyeballed how much i used i also used sausage instead of hamburger and added pepperoni because i love it i39m thinking of just baking and freezing the zucchini crust then adding the topping when i39m ready to make it i have so many zucchinis i figure i can store those easier in the freezer than the whole casserolebecause we will be eating this a lot i can tell
winner of a recipe perfect for the summer garden abundance i did not have ground burger so used pork sausage and it was great and i confess to using pasta sauce for the tomato sauce as i had a half jar in the fridge but this was super tasty and will go into my files for the future
got great reviews from the family on this was told to double it next time i did put a layer of pepperoni on the zucchini crust before the sauce mixture
i think this sounds good but the pizza influence is not there namely the seasonings in real pizza sauce basil oregano garlic salt and black pepper a can of paste added to the sauce simmer until it bubbles like the old mud pots at disneyland top the zucchini layer with sauce top with hamburger veg and cheese and that should bring this home been making pizza for 50 years trust me this works otherwise a great recipe and the zucchini rocks love keto
i did not have regular zucchini but used a green squash shredded i did use more mozzarella and cheddar cheese 2 cups each 15oz of pizza sauce 34 of a regular onion chopped 19 lb ground beef 1 chopped green pepper the regular parmesan cheese and eggs were kept as recipe stated i used a smaller baking dish 11x734 the size worked out great this is a great recipe i didn39t have italianstyle tomato sauce on hand
this was excellent and my picky kids loved it they asked me where the zucchini was as they couldn39t even taste it i added pepperoni to ours since my family loves pepperoni this recipe is a keeper and was a great way to use up all that garden zucchini
what a great idea to use zucchini i made several changes to our liking i fried the beef up with an entire fennel bulb instead of sauce i poured sundried tomatoes over the zuke mixture then some canned olives green chilies i also didn39t measure cheese i39m sure it was one half more took it out of the oven after 20 minutes topped with fresh basil and sliced mozzarella and broiled until bubbling yum
we really enjoyed this i did make some changes though i used ground chicken and i used a half a jar of marinara sauce i had leftover instead of plain tomatoes i also added pepperoni on top of half left the other half with just the peppers even the kids ate it i39ll definitely be making this again
this was awesome i made a few tweaks of course i baked the crust at 500 for 15 minutes and then did a low broil for 34 minutes before adding the topping just to crisp it up i also added turkey pepperoni to half of the top because my hub loves it this is exactly what we were looking for in terms of low carb pizza night thank you
ate this casserole at a church potluck and had to get the recipe i find italian tomato sauce at my grocery so i just got regular tomato sauce and added some italian seasonings you can also use spaghetti sauce too instead of the tomato sauce
made this tonight it was wonderful i will be making it again as it has made the monthly rotation list in our house
my sister told me she made this and how much she liked it since this is perfect for a diet i just started i thought i39d try it myself well i must say this is one delicious casserole the zucchini 34crust34 is so cheesy and delicious it could be a side dish on it39s own the hamburger topping just finishes it off perfectly the only thing i did different was to use a jar of pizza sauce instead of italian tomato sauce and i used a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of chopped onion this is a very good recipe on my meal rotation now
wow if i didn39t know i would not have known that it was a zucchini base what a great way to use zucchini i used my home canned marinara sauce and it was absolutely delicious
this was so good unfortunately i can39t leave well enough alone had to add pepperoni and olives on top when the grandkids were here used shredded chicken bacon and alfredo sauce in 2 8x839s for work endless possibilities for an wonderful base
this is delicious great use of the abundant crop of zucchini from our garden low carb too
i thought this was an awesome recipe interesting and quite tasty i did increase the meat to 1 12 pounds and used a marinara sauce thanks for sharing
this was good and i only used half the ground beef but doubled the onions
i can39t wait to try this love zucchini and pizza this was good i think i39ll use stewed tomatoes next time for more flavor
my family39s favorite
just did a review forgot to add that 34no salt added34 marinara sauces are available i use trader joe39s organic one
great recipe my son asked if i could make again everyone enjoyed it
wow i am so so impressed with this recipe it tastes like perfection which is an understatement i cannot wait to make this again thank you so much for an awesome recipe
my family really enjoyed this recipe i did use pizza sauce as others suggested and added italian spices it served closer to 4 people will make again
this is a creative and delicious recipe with many options i made the recipe as listed with a few minor changes i added pepper to the crust mixture substituted turkey and used a red bell pepper as i find it milder for young palates this will be a regular in my rotation our tenmonthold grand daughter ate three large servings
great recipe i used pizza sauce prego as recommended by other reviewers i also added 12 teaspoon pepper 12 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon pizza seasoning 12 teaspoon basil 12 teaspoon italian seasoning 1 teaspoon frozen pizza seasoning and 12 t garlic powder everyone loved it including the 2 and 8 year old grandchildren
excited by this simple yet tasty glutenfree recipe
this recipe is great i like to add mushrooms to the sauce and top with black olivesyum
excellent recipe didn39t change a thing i39ll be making it again delicious
it is like a pizza without a bread crust good recipe for a gluten free diet very tasty
excellent kids had seconds
my family loved this but i did make changes i used bulk italian sausage instead of ground beef and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce i don39t think it would have tasted like pizza otherwise the crust had to be baked longer than recommended and the zucchini needed more time in the colander to draw out the moisture knowing this now and making those changes i will be making it again
great recipe and really easy to make hotdish can39t believe anyone from minnesota would call it a casserole
i made this with the veggies from my garden it was so tasty that i will definitely make it again i found that it did not feed eight unless you have several sides or a giant salad the reason i like casseroles so much is so i don39t have to make sides i feel to have it as a stand alone meal that the more appropriate servings listed would be 5 or 6 next time i make it which i will for sure i will double the recipe if i intend to feed more than 4 loved it
love love love the zucchini crust i39ve made the recipe several times similar to as written i substituted pizza sauce also i take the grated zucchini and place on a clean dishtowel and wring out the moisture no salt no colander this last time i made it like a real pizza delicious
this recipe finally got my husband to eat zucchini not only that he39s been requesting it at least once a week since i discovered it on your site a few months ago getting the zucchini dry enough to crisp up was a challenge but we started using a handheld ricer to squeeze out small batches after shredding it in the food processor to save time it makes a huge difference and i find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well i toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce ground chicken turkey beef even elk and it has come out fantastic every time it only gets better the longer you let it cook
this is a go to dish for me every summer especially with a garden full of fresh zucchini there is lots of flexibility with this recipe and you can add garlic to the ground beef and onion mixture and add in some italian seasoning to the sauce mixture i have done it both ways and our family loves it including my 11 year old son
did not like at all
i followed the recipe and it was wonderful my dad even liked it and he eat anything green need to dry the zucchini more but this is a keeper
used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added italian spices to the meat and the zucchini mix everyone loved it
this was pretty good a great way to use up zucchini as there is always an abundance this time of year i did use italian sausage because that is what i had on hand i39ll definitely make again but think i will bake the zucchini 34crust34 a little longer so that it gets a little crispy
i understand the high ratings this would have been flavorless had i not added extra seasoning hard to believe this won any contest
this was really good
this is our favorite main dish zucchini recipe just top it with whatever your favorite pizza toppings are if you want more flavor than the ground beef i usually use the ground beef onion tomato sauce layer then might add some pepperoni olives sausage additional onion mushroomswhatever i want on my pizza love it love the results not watery at all
i knew from reading this recipe that it would be tasty i am usually one of those review readers who does eye rolls when reading that the reviewer followed the recipe except forthen lists a long list of modifications well i made some changes too and the outcome was great i followed the process instructions as written i used sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef as i wanted a little zippier flavor more pizzalike i also added 1 tsp of minced garlic after the sausageonion mixture was browned who doesn39t like a little garlic in pizza my grocery store did not have italian tomato sauce so i used regular and added 1 tsp of italian seasoning since the recipe called for either red or green pepper i used half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper giving the dish a colorful look my husband was a bit skeptical until the first bitethen he was a convert he raved about it and i do have to say it was delicious i had split the mixture into two casseroles with the idea of bakeonefreezeone i39ll have to see how that goes next time i make it because we39ve plowed right into the next casserole the next night leftovers were as delicious as the first night i have strict instructions to make this dish again
made this last night for a potluck today everyone loved iti work with lots of people on 34keto34 and i was really glad to find something they could eat without needing to change anything just make sure you get the excess moisture out of the zucchini i layer mine on a cookie sheet and dried it out a bit 400 for 10 min before i cooled and combined it with the egg and cheese and you can get it firm without being too dry
this is tasty i sliced my zucchini very thin instead of shredding it i mixed it with the eggs parm cheese and half the other cheeses but didn39t bake it until i added the remaining ingredients as listed
a great way to use zucchini really good tasting but our first question was 34where is the crust34 the casserole baked up nicely and looked good but we couldn39t find a crust my family said i should add noodles i might add more flour i added cut up ham and black olives instead of the hamburger and peppers yummy flavor
excellent hubby had 3 helpings the only addition i made was 1 tsp italian seasoning next time try sausage garlic
lynn39s recipe was fantastic my whole family loved a new dish which i feel doesn39t happen that often i forgot the red or green pepper but it still tasted great i added a little drizzle of olive oil to the zucchini part just before layering on the meat sauce really really delishand easy
this is my favorite pizza recipe i don39t do bread and this smells so pizza awesome i can39t get enough
love this i 39drain39 zucc by spreading out large kitchen towel or two cover with a couple layers of paper towel then after i39ve pushed all the liquid i can out through the colander i spread the zucc on the towel layers and roll it up tight may take a couple times but it really does the trick and then your crust will be crisper also my grandsons think pepperoni is a food group so we don39t use beef or sausage just spread pizza sauce over crust put a think layer of pepperoni on this then your cheeses and veggies sometimes bacon with the pepperoni why not after it39s done everyone puts their own toppings on as desired they love to help make it too so are happy to eat it
so easy to adapt to your tastes groceries on hand tonight i swapped the quantites of cheddar and mozzarella and added a 25oz bag of bacon bits to the meat mixture for 34bacon cheeseburger pizza34 hubby took one bite and announced 34it39s a keeper34 i plan to try a version with mexiblend cheese and taco seasoning in the meat maybe salsa or taco sauce instead of tomato sauce
delicious the kids will love it healthy
great recipe i use half ground beef and half hot italian sausage
very good but add to your notes about crust z ucchini must be squeezed very wellusing several double layers of paper towels and repeat several timeseven after draining then 34crust34 should be kinda thin ish but even everywhere in pan or thicker parts do not crisp up well then be sure to cool crust completely so that meat
httpspakrealestatenewswordpresscom20190808dhadefenceislamabad
i cooked the pepper in with the hamburger because we don39t like ours crunchy it was very good we also did add a little more salt and some pepper
this ain39t pizza until you use a pizza crust so i did well sort of i placed a readymade roll out pie crust over the top increased the temp and saved some of the cheese to sprinkle on top for the last few minutes of baking
tried and true recipe i made it with ground buffalo and a bit more spices but how can you go wrong definitely try it
know what these people are talking about not even a pizza as the zucchini crust never gets crispy a casserole
this is one of my favorite recipes i made this for my bunco group and they all wanted the recipe this is a keeper
good way to work some veggies into our diet
made this recently for a potluck it was delicious even the people who said they didn39t like zucchini loved it this one is a keeper
just picked a bag of zucchini so decided to try this recipe for supper i doubled the recipe except used 1 12 lb ground beef and added a little garlic powder italian seasoning and basil to the sauce baked the 34crust34 for 27 minutes but will do longer next time as the casserole ended up a little watery used a 25 minute second bake even my zucchini hating husband raved about it
we really liked this a good way to get your veggies
this is so simple and so good had an abundance of zucchini from the garden and this is one of our favorite ways to eat zucchini the only change i made is that sometimes i add slices of pepperoni before adding the cheese topping a winner
this is a great way to use up all that zucchini i added some garlic and using sausage gave it more flavor
this was wonderful my husband and i are both on keto and this tasted so good it makes for good leftovers as well i followed the recipe exactly except for using frozen zucchini lots of water to squeeze out because i didn39t have any fresh on hand i will definitely be making this again when we have a bunch of zucchini fresh from our garden
absolutely awesome and fit perfectly into my keto diet my entire family loved this recipe i used deerburger vs hamburger as that is what i had on hand delicious
love this thank you made with ground turkey breast yummy and freezes well for lunches
we loved it hubby said it was a definite keeper and was even better the next day only changes i made based on some other readers was to make sure the water was squeezed out of the zukes and i added a can of mushrooms italian herbs and extra mozzarella because i had it can39t wait to make it again next time am going to add italian sausage to it great recipe
perfect as is almost no carbs
made this again with turkey sausage instead of the hamburger much tastier and hubby loved it so need to up the rating to a 5 instead of a 4 would definitely have again and again
excellent was looking for another low carb dish when i found this i sauteed some chopped mushrooms and added them to the sauce omitted the pepper cause we don39t like it i used marinara sauce that was low in sugar in place of the tomato sauce this is very tasty my hubby suggested next time to use italian sausage instead of ground beef but i thought it was perfect
my husband said this is a keeper i added some red pepper flakes to the zucchini mixture used prego pizza sauce amp added garlic amp italian seasoning to the meat he is on a low carb diet
this is just delicious i followed the directions exactly we all loved it
we love this 34casserole34 we are on a lowcarb diet my husband and i and have a craving for italian food especially pizza this has solved our problem without busting the diet after the first time i made it i have changed it a bit not in the recipe but in the preparation since there are only 2 of us i make the bottom 34crust34 in 2 8x8 inch pans lined with parchment paper partly up the side and sprayed with cooking spray i make half of the recipe in each and cook it as directed after cooling i lift it out by the parchment put both in a freezer container and freeze until we are ready to use it when we need a pizza we take one 34crust34 thaw it in the 8x8 pan and put the toppings on cook it in the oven as the recipe calls for it is almost as quick as a frozen pizza
loved it did add some more italian seasoning to it
i did as someone suggested made half the recipe amp put in 8x8 baking dish i used prego and squeezed the zucchini with paper towels to remove more moisture fabulous even my zucchinihating hubby loves this will be making this again
have made this several times and everyone loves it
turned out amazing kids loved it i cooked the red pepper with the ground beef and onions
very tasty to those who thought it was too soggygoopy squeeze the zucchini in your fist to remove the extra liquid we loved this
excellent recipe i wouldn39t call it pizza per se reminded me more of carbless lasagna i cut the amount of ground beef in half doubled the onions and added about as much mushrooms i used jarred barilla traditional pasta sauce next time i39m thinking of using only half the cheese in the zucchini mix and replacing that amount with more zucchini and double the salt i39ll also add garlic as many commenters have suggested it holds up well as leftovers
so delicious i did use fresh grated parmesan cheese and topped with fresh sliced mozzarella didn39t add any shredded mozzarella to the zucchini mixture only used cheddar and parmesan and still came out great
made it with italian sausage instead of ground beef and added 2 tsp minced garlic yummy everyone loved it i like the zucchini crust especially since it cuts down on carbs will definitely be making this again
excellent i liked it better fresh out of the oven so i will stick to a 12 recipe 834 square pyrex to limit leftovers delicious ps i used ground chicken instead of beef to lower cholesterol couldn39t tell one bit of difference
this was fantastic we don39t eat a lot of pizza because of the carbs so this is an incredible substitute for pizza we will definitely be making it again
very tasty versatile crust great way to use up the zucchini overload even those who don39t care for zucchini will enjoy it have made it with a layer of ricotta fresh tomatoes and basil instead of the the meat sauce for a vegetarian alternative
i also added some extra italian seasoning and garlic powder my husband who usually does not care for vegetables went back for more
this is also good as a mexican casserole switch your cheeses to mexican mix cheeses and pepper jack same with sauce try rotel or even an enchilada sauce with chunky salsa
been making this for years i call it zucchini parmesian i saute some fresh garlic coat the zuchiini with some flaoved breat crummbs then fry just a littleput in casserole dish then just ad my marinara sauce mozzarella and parmesian and bake very flavorful with just the two cheeses
just made this and will be making it again but found it a bit bland so the next time i make it i39ll be adding a little heat and different more pungent cheese combination i didn39t saute the red peppers and loved it that way hubby just went for seconds a good sign update just realized i used tomato sauce instead of a spiced italian sauce my bad trying it again this time i39ll read the directions more carefully
we have made this many times and love it i use pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce which is more flavorful to lighten it up a little we use 2 percent cheese and turkey italian sausage or turkey pepperoni very easy to freeze and take in my lunch later too
we loved this will definitely make againmy husband said it39s better than spaghetti used canned pizza sauce and parmesan on top could use a little more zucchini i think i need to start growing zucchini lol
this was amazing huge hit
absolutely delicious and so easy
this recipe is really good and a great summer dish for when zucchinis are in abundance i loved the zucchini crust it was such a nice change of pace to a heavy bread crust the only changes i made were based on using ingredients on hand used an italian cheese blend for the mozzarella and a colbyjack blend for the cheddar because i had both of those i love a dish that is versatile in that way so just use whatever cheese combo you like best on this dish and you should have a winner also i took the advice of others and cooked the bell pepper with the beef and onions because my family prefers that combo my skeptical pizza loving daughter ate this and said it was good i will definitely be making this dish again
loved this recipe the only thing i did differently was i cooked the peppers with beef and onions tastes even better as leftovers the next day
this recipe is really really good i39ve also used the zucchini cheese and egg mix as the base for eggplant parmesan instead of pasta everyone loves it
love this great way to use up a jar of pizza sauce too come summer everyone has zucchinis everything is in this meal tooa filling side dish or a complete meal made it in ramekinsa good way to serve it toospray the ramekins thosausage substitute work39s as wellbiggest deal is getting all the water out of the zucchini
has become a favorite at my house added two cloves of garlic to the sauce and half onion and its delicious
i made this years ago for my veggie hating kids making it now for my veggie hating grandkids hubby and i love it and the grandkids don39t know what they39re eating works for me
i have made this many times now and every time it39s still fantastic only changes i39ve made is that i use frozen chopped peppers and onions and cook them with the hamburger i also use plain tomato sauce and just add italian seasoning and garlic
this is excellent i loved that it tastes like pizza and the zucchini was essentially hidden in the dish i did make a few changes ground turkey instead of ground beef and i ran out of mozzarella cheese so i ended up using cheddar to replace it i would absolutely make this again maybe adding a few pizza toppings to it as well
this deserves all the fantastic reviews if you are looking for recipes that will work well with a spiralizer i used my thincut zucchini noodles instead of shredding them and it was great i loved seeing my kids inhale all the zucchini
i made this casserole on 11116 and it39s delicious i did use 3 small red peppers ground turkey in place of the beef 2 cups shredded pizza cheese blend and 1 cup pepperjackcheddar cheese blend since i had those prepared cheeses on hand i39d also added 1 tsp salt and 14 tsp pepper to the ground turkeychopped onion and i used a 15oz can pizza sauce i used a 3qt casserole delowenstein
i made this today and it was easy and delicious i will definitely make it again
with over 200 5star reviews i felt this dish was a no brainer i like to try new toh recipes that don39t have as many reviews yet but i wanted a sure fire meal for tonight it was yummyloved the baked shredded zucchinicheese base and can39t go wrong with a tomato beef mixture with more cheese two thumbs way up and a perfect casserole to make anytime husband liked as much as i did
this is definitely a do it again i will try adding some other 34pizza34 toppings next time
my husband really enjoyed the meal didn39t have enough of some of the cheeses used what i had next time i39m going to top it with saute or canned mushroom you could top it with any of your favorite topping
this was very good will be making again very soon thank you for such a great recipe
outstanding recipe anyone who39s tasted this always requests the recipe yes it39s that darn good
made this tonight for supper there was just the 2 of us we liked it so much we ate over half of it leftovers tomorrow i followed recipe pretty much to a tee loved it
excellent i used half summer squash and half zucchinia perfect use for some of the squash our garden is giving us i substituted mild provolone cheese for the cheddar and added some slices of turkey pepperoni for a little more 34pizza34 flavor i also gave the top of the casserole a sprinkling of penzey39s frozen pizza seasoningthat really sealed the deal we loved this casserolei39ll definitely be making it again thank you lynn
this recipe was so easy to make a little different way to use zucchini my guests loved itserved six not eight i will definitely make it again
i39ve made this twice in the last two weeks as it39s become one of my husband39s top faves of my recipes it39s just the two of us so i always halve the recipe and bake it in an 8x8 pan it takes a little less time and i cover it for the last ten minutes of baking to prevent over browning and we get three dinners out of it this time i made it in the morning as 1 it doesn39t heat the house up quite as much earlier in the day and 2 we both think it tastes better after it sits awhile i generally avoid cheesymeaty dishes during the hotter months but this one doesn39t come off as heavy because of the zucchini 34crust34 i39ve made it without the peppers on top or with roasted red peppers and it39s super either way
i39m going to try making this tonight with pepperoni instead of ground meat
made this for the second time yesterday it was very good will definitely make it often during zucchini season
excellent recipe
my family devoured this delicious dish after reading the reviews i made sure to dry the zucchini well and i jazzed up my sauce with some fresh herbs basil parsley and oregano and garlic and instead of ground beef i used hot and spicy breakfast sausage i had on hand can39t wait to make it again with a layer of sauteed mushrooms thanks for this great recipe
this was one of the worst recipe i have ever tried from your site it was a total mush bunch of green goop and i had to throw it out what a waste of my time it preparing it
this was excellent recommend cooking red pepper with beef and adding garlic italian seasoning and red pepper flakes to amp up the flavors we really enjoyed this
i made this yesterday with zucchini fresh from the garden i actually cut the recipe in half and it turned out just fine i also did not use hamburger but instead we used 1 cup of pepperoni
very good and easy i used tofu for the hamburger
i made this tonight and i must say it is delicious i did take a couple of suggestions from others 1 i drained the zucchini for about 30 minutes then i pressed out as much moisture as i could in the strainer then transferred to paper towel and blotted some more my casserole was not runny 2 i added 12 tsp basil and 12 tsp oregano and 2 minced garlic cloves to tomato sauce mixture and sauteed the green peppers with the meat and onion the sauce was anything but bland i will be making this recipe for a long time to come thank you
i39ve made this recipe several times as written it39s a great way to use zucchini and it39s always a hit
excellent great low carb dish to satisfy cravings for pizza will be making this and changing up the meatveggies to make different varitiesthis time i used ground beefmushrooms and black olives i also added seasoning to tomato sauce red pepper flakes garlic powder and italian seasoning
awesome we practically cleaned out the bowl no leftovers so sad
this recipe is great it39s delicious and different we tried it with sausage instead of beef first and that was way too salty that is not the fault of the recipe though i add italian seasoning to the sauce and cook the green pepper with the onion
my picky family liked this recipe i made it as written except that i added minced garlic when browning the ground beef and also used pizza sauce instead of italian tomato sauce i may try some other options next time like adding mushrooms
very good recipe i too added a bit more seasoning to the meat oregano and garlic but otherwise made as written i tend to like my food a bit more spicy so thought maybe i39d add some dried pepper flakes to the meat the next time very good warmed up the next day too i can39t wait for zucchini season to make this again and again
i don39t eat carbs pasta etc and can39t wait to make this will probably add some ricotta on top of the zucchini
everyone loved this
i passed this recipe along to a friend who made it for a church potluck and everyone wanted the recipe she made some and brought it to work and got the same rave reviews
love love love this recipe and it reheats wonderfully great way to sneak in veggies too
this is delicious but needs to be seasoned i added oregano basil salt and pepper i added a couple of cloves of garlic to the onionhamburger blend while browning my antizucchini family really enjoyed it

good way to use garden zucchini
this dish was very tasty my husband loved the dish i added slices of pepperjack cheese to the topping will definitely make again
family loves this recipe i skipped the green pepper but added garlic and mushrooms i used one can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes drained and pureed to give it some texture and also added italian seasoning basil and garlic powder i have shared this with many friends thank you
my husband and i loved this dish very flavorful and easily made i followed the recipe as written except for the substitution of pizza sauce for the tomato sauce i like that this casserole may also be frozen and the next time i make it and there will definitely be a next time i think i will put it into two 834 dishes and pop one in the freezer for later great recipe
i made this recipe the other night and it is fantastic i didn39t use tomato sauce i used a can of stewed tomatoes and added 1 tblspn of basil and thyme to make it more italian i cooked it down until the liquid dissipated it was super delicious
awesome
i have enjoyed this recipe as written and it was delicious i have now added my own additions and use hot sausage in place of the beef i have also used pizza sauce to make it more like pizza and added traditional pizza toppings great taste anyway you decide to make it and it is a great recipe for those that are doing keto or low carb diets
made for dinner tonight for my adult son and iomgosh it39s so delicious thank you i didn39t have mozzarella so i grated string cheesei used two can tomato sauce and sprinkled with italian seasoning and garlic powder yumoh an a dash of sugar yes sugar about a teaspoon i omitted the green peppers didn39t have any but sprinkle chopped green onions scallions yumi wanted to get seconds think i39ll wait till tomorrow calories lolgood luckmuch alohacindy wilson
easy to fix and great taste i used pepperoni instead of ground beef to make more pizzalike family would have liked it more if had a firmer crust
this was very good and i liked adding nutrition by using zucchini instead of a bread crust
great recipe good way to use up all the zucchini from our garden
i cut in squares and took to a potluck it was a hit my changes were i used 12 ground turkey and 12 pork sausage had eggplant in garden so grated in with zucchini will make again
my husband is not a picky eater but my children and i are we all loved this so much we made it twice and brought it to a family party where it was devoured great texture flavor and taste i made sure to not only drain the zucchini but blotted it with paper towels it was perfect
this was wonderful tasting in place of the ground beef i used sausage and in place of the italian tomato sauce i used homemade marinara the zucchini will be soggy if you don39t drain it properly but it still tastes good you can pour off the extra liquid for nice and firm leftovers
awesome will make again and again
very good i used sausage instead of ground beef also added pizza sauce to tomato sauce because i didn39t have italian tom sauce i will definitely make again
very good but extremely high in fat and cholesterol so not really a 34healthy dish34 but very tasty
made this tonight and we both loved it since i just had regular tomato sauce i added italian seasoning and some garlic powder definitely a keeper
i made this for my husband39s coworkers it was a big hit very easy to make and a great way to get people to eat their veggies i added one tsp of parsley to the sauce bc i could only find plain sauce
i made this dish for a book club i just recently joined it was a big hit bangeverybody wants the recipe great way to utilize the abundance of veggie this time of year
family loved it next time i39ll double it
i made this tonight for supper with few adjustments package of ground turkey was a little more than a pound so added more onion plus used prego chunky garden tomato onion amp garlic spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce didn39t measure the cheese anyone who loves cheese doesn39t care if there is more most of the ingredients as to the amounts can be adjusted to your preference it was wonderful my husband thought it was really good amp kept taking a little more amp a little more i will definitely be making it again
this was really good i thought it tasted more like lasagna than pizza maybe it was because i used a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce i did follow the ret of the recipe i will make this again
my husband hates zucchini when i served this dish he raved and raved about it he thought the zucchini crust was actually rice but when i told him what it really was he just smiled and went back for seconds i will definitely make this again next time we may add olives to it for some extra zing but the recipe is great asis
this got my husbands 2 thumbs uphad it today for lunch i did add 1tsp each basil oregano and garlic powder to sauce along with fresh mushrooms on top definitely a keeper
i saw that this was one of the best rated casseroles so it inspired me to try it it wasn39t anything to really rave about and i wouldn39t make it again unless i added something like sausage maybe that would be better it tasted kind of bland to me needed some spices to taste like pizza
i fixed this last night for my husband amp medelicious i used venison for the meat amp a little variation on the cheesesadded my own spices to tomato sauceonly because this is all i had on hand but you couldn39t ask for it to be any better than this thank youdefinitely a keeper
i39ve been a subscriber to taste of home since the very early 9039s and have to say this is my first review of any recipe believe me my family has many favorite toh recipes but i have to say this is excellent i added a teaspoon each of dried basil oregano and garlic powder to the zucchini mixture instead of ground beef i used 12 lb each of ground sirloin and turkey sausage i also used mushrooms i know i hate when someone rates a recipe after they changed it but it would be just as delicious made as printed thanks lynn for a great way to use up an abundance of zucchini
excellent
whole family loved it added some oregano basil and garlic powder next time will replace 12 pound of burger with italian sausage
i look forward to making this dish i love zucchini and pizza so this is a great combo and it39s a good way to get my family to eat more veggies
i forgot to tell you that i added 1 c quick oatmeal and 1 c chopped walnuts to the reserved crust for the topping
very good
i loved this recipe different great way to use zucchini flavors even better day 2 and beyond enjoying to the last bite
had last night for dinner and it was excellent we are trying to go low carb and this looked great i made sure the zucchini was well drained and i baked it 25 minutes and the crust was fine i did leave out the cheddar cheese and added more parmesan i also used turkey italian sausage for more flavor and we don39t eat much beef topped with it with regular jar spaghetti sauce since that is all i had and yellow peppers onion some garlic so yummy
this was a great recipe to use up zucchini i would make this again
both my husband and i liked it and my kids loved it i did add some seasonings to the crust garlic italian seasoning basil and oregano
this wasn39t bad but i thought the green pepper overpowered everything and i like green pepper i used spaghetti sauce and added some garlic powder and fresh basal to the sauce i think i will try again but will put mushrooms and black olives on top and skip the green peppers definitely worth making again with some tweaking
my husband and i loved it since we live in new mexico i added chopped green chile it is a keeper next time i will also add fresh mushrooms
this was good but i think i like lkimk77 recipe so i39m going to try it except for home made sauce i39ll use pizza sauce and no bell pepper we can39t eat them i39ll use a banana or sweet pepper
this was awesome my entire family loves it i usually use sausage pizza sauce and add green peppers and fresh mushrooms this is a keeper
i love this recipe it39s one of the reasons we grow zucchini
excellent recipe a definite 34do over34
this is a awesome pizza for a gluten free diet i used my home made red sauce omitted the cheddar cheese and topped it with sauteed mushrooms onions orange pepper amp black olives and topped with green onion before serving
delicious
followed sks239s review and made with spaghetti sauce husband and 1 year old loved it will definitely make again
how i made the recipe shown i did green onion instead of white onion no ground beef turkey bacon without nitrates red and green bell peppers diced and my bottom layer crust also contained squash with the zucchini i used a food processor attachment to shred the zuke and squash added an extra egg white as i had i had more veggies at the bottom layer added crushed red pepper to my pizza sauce layer it was awesome
this was very good i used spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce
loved this and enjoyed the leftovers a few days later delicious i added a small can of petite diced tomatoes well drained have prepared it several times already
great way to use up my vast supply of zuchinni
my husband loved this dish and was happy that there were leftovers for his lunch the next day after reading other reviews i was very careful to make sure i really got the moisture out of the zucchini and was glad i had this came out great i will definitely be making again and may follow some of the suggestions for other toppings like pepperoni or maybe even using the sausage in place of the ground beef
my family didn39t like it the zucchini was too soggy
this was a big hit with my family it39s definitely worth giving it a try
love this casserole great way to use up summer zucchini i have made several so we have some in the freezer for later
actually tastes even better the next day as a leftover
my husband loved it and brought some for lunch to work he told and showed it off another guy wanted receipei did add pepperoni ontop with with italian stylesix cheese blend as finishing toucheven looked better
when i first mentioned this to dh his response was somewhat short of enthusiastic but his motto is 34i39ll try anything once34 he absolutely raved about this dish after reading many of the reviews i made sure that my zucchini was as dry as possible i didn39t use salt but squeezed the shredded zucchini through some linen towels and then lit it sit for about a half hour then squeezed it through paper towels i really wanted a firm crust so baked it for 25 minutes rather than 20 that timing was absolutely perfect the edges were just starting to brown i added garlic red pepper flakes and some dried oregano to the sauce and sprinkled some fresh julienned basil on top of the casserole right before baking the ground beef was more prevalent a flavor than i had expected and the zucchinie was less this is a great casserole in which to 34hide34 vegetables we39d love to try it with italian sausage instead of the ground beef but unfortunately that would raise the fat content through the roof all and all a yummy recipe
we didn39t care for this at all
delicious added a little crushed pepper flakes
i made this casserole just as wrtten and it was good the next time i made it i used italian sausage instead of the ground beef and it was fantastic
this was a major hit in our home my daughter is a veggieihater and she even loved it this is a definite future meal in our home again
made this for dinner last night it wasn39t bad but i wasn39t blown away by it i didn39t really taste the zucchini so it would be a good way to sneak some in on a veggie hater left off the green peppers amp topped mine with mushrooms amp black olives i will probably make it again but not often as there is a lot of cheese
we loved this i have to admit though that i added basil and oregano from the garden and more salt and pepper
made just as written except for subbing pasta sauce for tomato sauce a keeper for sure love the low carb
everyone likes this casserole who39ve tried it i use pizza sauce and add pizza toppings that we like mushrooms turkey pepperoni pineapple etc i make it very often year round
it was great the hardest part was drying our the zucchini i added mushrooms and olives
my son didn39t really like this but i did of course he doesn39t like lasagna i can39t explain it so that may be part of it but i liked the zucchinii might have to experiment with it a bit more
awesome recipe i deviated a bit substituting ground turkey for ground beef and using a monterey jack jalapeño cheese blend instead of the cheddar this recipe is great for low carb diets i look forward to making it again with other popular pizza toppings like mushrooms
so good
i love zucchini this casserole is very good and leftovers are good too
i wasn39t sure that my family would go for this one but my two worst critics the husband and the picky son loved it i would agree with everyone else that the zucchini needs about 20 min to drain and i took handfuls and squeezed it out and had no problems will be making again soon
excellent it has already become a family favorite amp i39ve made it several times i added some pizza seasoning to the sauce to make it take even more pizzay
very good
after i wrote my review i was reading all the others and quite a few was talking about it being watery first let it stand about 2030 minutes then squeeze it out by handfuls that really helps but i found if i baked the crust about 3035 minutes or longer before adding the sauce makes for a firmer crust love it
i seen this recipe on here last year and have made it several times now my husband loves it so much i even had to buy zucchini from the store during the winter months and into summer till the zucchini was ready again once when i had been canning some homemade pasta sauce i had a bit left over in the refrigerator and decided to use that in place of the tomato sauce it was excellent also have used leftover taco meat that was good too thanks
very good i wish i had this recipe at the beginning of zucchini season will definitely make again three people ate all most the whole dish i let the zucchini set with the salt a good 20 minutes i used some of my homemade salsa and homemade spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce i also topped with some of my pickled hungarian waxed peppers excellent flavor
this was delicious i substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce and used pepperoni instead of ground beef yummy leftovers were great
excellent i didn39t think my husband would like this be he did he thought it would make a good dip it truly is a unique way to use zucchini and it was delicious good leftover too
this is a fabulous way to use up extra zucchini i double the meattomato mixture as my husband and boys needed a meatier dish i didn39t have italian tomato sauce and have found that one big can of hunt39s spaghetti sauce is perfect for the doubled mixture i agree it is even better the next day
excellent recipe will definitely make again
four out of four adults in this family did not care for this at all it was too rich and greasy with all the cheese
so good and so easy wonderful way to use zucchini
very very good followed the advice from other comments i let the zucchini sit for 30 minutes and squeezed out by the handful added 12 lb of mild italian sausage and pepperoni39s on top even better the next day
this was amazing draining the water out of the zucchini was more time consuming plan for atleast 15 minutes i added fresh basil on top all 3 kids and my husband loved it
this was so good will make it again the only thing i did different was used pizza sauce instead of the tomatoe sauce
i let my shredded amp salted zucchini sit for about 20 minutes then squeezed as much of the liquid out as i could by handfuls since i felt i would be able to get more out that way after i pressed it into the dish i used several paper towels to soak up excess liquid after baking the zucchini was still a little 34liquidy34 but not bad i39m wondering how it would be with 1 egg instead with the 2 eggs it didn39t seem to bind the zucchini in fact it seems the cheese would do a good enough jobi used spaghetti sauce and added a little more garlic and a very small sprinkling of oregano and basil
terrific recipe i did sub my homemade pizza sauce for the tomato sauce because that39s what i had i left out the cheddar and increased the two other cheeses to make it up i also added pepperoni will make this again and again thanks
this is one of my favorite recipes only i add one can of diced tomatoes and use one small can of sauce instead of the 15 oz can of sauce
this was so good probably one of the best zucchini recipes i have made i didn39t have any green peppers but used pepperonis on top instead i premade the casserole the day before but waited to put the remaining cheese and pepperonis on top until the last 10 minutes of reheating before i put the pepperonis on top i microwaved them a bit and blotted off the grease then i cut them up and sprinkled them on top
i made this late night and everyone loved it i replaced the ground beef with ground turkey and added oregano garlic powder salt and pepper to the meat sauce
made this casserole exactly as the recipe is written next time tweaked it and used 12 hamburger and 12 italian sausage only because we like a little more spice this is a wonderful recipe our entire family loved it even my picky fatherinlaw and our 4 12 year old granddaughter this is a keeper
this recipe is delicious i baked the crust for 30 min replaced the green pepper with green and black olives will definitely make again
i loved this recipe but used chopped pepperoni slices to make it really taste like pizza
this is my new favorite recipe i have made this dish about 6 times in the last 4 months i use a pound of sausage and a pound of ground beef cook them both combine with the spaghetti sauce and than divide i use one mixture right away and freeze the other for a later useyou can also make the zucchini crust a day early and assemble the whole recipe put it in the fridge and bake the next day for dinnerthis is my new lasagnaand so much cheaper too
very good the process of drainig the zucchini was long i drained it for 30 minutes squeezed it and drained again for 30 minutes i then rolled it in a towel to make sure all the liquid was gone i used mild turkey sausage and added garlic and italian seasoning to the meat i will make this again but next time i will cook the zucchini longer until it is golden brown and starts to get crusty
my husband and i love this dish i substitute the hamburger for italian style ground turkey which gives it more flavor than regular hamburger
used italian sausage for meat very good use for zucchini
trying to watch my carbs this is delish i used pizza sauce and topped it with mushrooms and italian sausage crumbledyum put in containers for lunch this week
our family loved this my husband not a huge zucchini fan and my oneyearold son both ate two pieces since my family is smaller i made it in two pie plates so we could give one away worked perfectly i agree with other reviews that the zucchini needs to drain longer at least 2030 minutes to get properly dry otherwise it39s a bit soggy will definitely make again
delicious added a shredded potato to the zucchini mixture because i didn39t have quite enough zucchini also added mushroom definately a keeper
i really liked this recipe quite a bit the flavors were excellent together and i loved the 34juiciness34 of the dish it was delicious i added a little crushed red peppers and some mushrooms to the sauce
all 8 of us loved the flavor not hugely filling as is and quite watery from the zucchini next time i made it decided to add 23 c of cooked spaghetti to zucchinicheese mixture delicious and completely filling have made it several times now and works out great has become a big favorite
i39m not a huge fan of zucchini but am trying to eat more veggies this was wonderful i didn39t even taste the zucchini i made this as is but it definitely lends itself to experimenting yum
tasted great but was too mushy
i made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it even my 6yr old good meal for my diabetic husband he said it was very filling
i absolutely loved this recipe and so did my husband it was especially tasty for leftovers the next day i will definitely make this again
what a great recipe
one of my 12 year olds favorite things we add a bit more cheese than it calls for great for warming up at work the next day
this recipe is quick easy and delicious it39s definitely a favorite for our family i39ve shared it with friends and the reviews are the same i do have a couple additions that i feel complete the dishalthough not necessary fresh garlic and fresh basil
of course i always have to tweak a recipe but i did add a bit of basil and marjoram to the meattomato sauce mixture i also added minced garlic i probably strained the zucchini for about 20 minutes i probably squeezed 2 cups of liquid out of it it still seemed wet but when i mixed it with the cheese it was almost a little too dry to combine until i mixed the eggs in i also sliced roma tomatoes sprinkled with basil pepper and salt on top before adding the top layer of cheese i39ll definitely make this again
i did not soak my zucchini and i use tomato sauce with italian herbs everyone loved it
love this recipe cheesy and delicious i am always looking for new ways to use zucchini from my garden
my whole family really liked this recipe the only thing i did different was i added some dried oregano and basil to the beef mixture and crumbled 5 strips of cooked bacon on top along with the green pepper i39ll be making this again
i made twice this to take to two different gatherings and everyone that tried it loved it i have passed out several copies of the recipe and am still getting requests for it i did add a little minced garlic to the sauce then spinkled on fresh chopped basil and oregano on top before baking easy and tasty
absolutely delicious my husband said 34it39s a do over34 he also took the leftovers to work and shared a bite with his supervisor and his coworker they also loved it and requested their own serving next time lol
my son said that it tasted like my homemade pizza before he knew that there was zucchini in the crust my family liked it i will make it again
extremely disappointed while it was tasty i added oregano and garlic to the sauce it came out a wet mess since i drained the meat mixture well and used sauce right from the can without adding water all i can think is 10 minutes isn39t nearly long enough to saltdrain the zucchini which i pressed to drain in the strainer and then squeezed in a towel
some one gave me three zucchinis and this was one of the recipes i tried it was delicious looking forward to making it again
this was super my four kids came home from sports practice and loved it even the one who doesn39t like zucchini i doubled the ground beef and used a can of spaghetti sauce i cooked onion and peppers with the meat i added a layer of pepperoni on top the meat layer i did not have cheddar cheese so omitted that it was fantastic i think i will try low fat cheese next time it is an excellent way to use up zucchini
absolutely wonderful i substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce since this is a pizza recipe i also added the onion along with the green pepper as pizza is normally made i gave the recipe to 6 people the first day i made it for work
i have made this twice so far and my family and neighbors love it
with no offense meant to the creator of this recipe i felt cheated with a name like zucchini pizza casserole i expected some pizza flavors i didn39t get any of that at all it was tasty as made according to the recipe but disappointing i kind of thought the zucchini layer on the bottom would be more like a crust but it wasn39t i will try this again but i have some other ideas to ramp it up
deliciousness surpassed our expectations made it last night and can39t wait till we have it leftover tomorrow night used italian sausage in place of burger and added a few banana pepper rings to the top my husband said to be sure and write 34keeper34 before filing it away i would serve this to company
my family loved it let the zucchini dry longer and omitted the salt next time my family asked me to add mushrooms it was delicious
love this recipe low carb i39m diabetic and so easy to sub lowfat ingredientsi made mine with low fat cheeses and ground turkey breast everyone loved it
too salty i even omitted the pre salting lacked substancewaste of my good zucchini
made this for my family and everyone loved it awesome recipe
awesome way to use up all that zucchini
i didn39t use the salt just let it set for about 30 minutes like another review said to do i added a little bit of oregano and basil to the tomato sauce since i didn39t have italian tomato sauce i might cut back just a little on the cheese taste was excellent will be freeze zucchini so i can have this during the winter months
followed advice to be sure zucchini is very dry and used italian sausage instead of hamburger this was awesome a definite keeper for my family
very good my family loved it i used half spagetti sauce and half it talian tomato sauce and then added italian seasoning to give it a little extra kick i will definately make this again
loved this i would like to try adding fresh spinach to this next time i used italian seasoned gr turkey i also sauteed the chopped onion with the gr pepper i also added some fresh basil to the turkey onion and gr pepper mix i used a nice marinar sauce from trade joes and did put black olives in under the top layer of cheese
my family loved this recipe we will definitely will make this againsooner than later
i cooked the green pepper with the beef and onion plus some garlic next time i39m not using any salt and i may try ground turkey
for those worried about the sodium content you don39t need to sprinkle the zucchini with salt let it stand for 12 hour amp then wring it out really well it will be just as good as sprinkling with salt any recipe that has this much cheese will have a high sodium content as cheese is loaded with salt no need adding more if you can help it
i use pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce and i added chopped onions it39s so delicious and burst of flavors
have not made this recipe yet but sounds really delish my neighbor has an abundance of zucchini while i only planted two plants this year i will definitely print her out a copy of this recipe has anyone tried throwing in some sliced or chunked pepperoni too once i make the recipe as directed i always 34tweek34 it so i may add some pepperoni the second time i know my family will love this recipe can39t wait to make it and will report back i may also make one for my son who went back to college and is living in an apt near campus he and his room mates would love this
i made this for my family several months ago delicious i have made it 4 more times since then my husband raves about it and my teenage son eats the zucchini with no complaints 5 stars from us
this was wonderful my husband raved about it at work and had people request the recipe
one of the best recipes i39ve ever made my family wants to know when i39ll be making it again
i made this for my family and they loved it i will definetely make it again
my husband amp i loved this recipe i used putanesca spaghetti sauce and it was fabulous i will be making it for our family picnic
i used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and it worked great also i omited the cheddar cheese and it was still delicious
wonderful delicious versatile can39t wait to make it again the zucchini crust is fantastic the key is to squeeze all the liquid out and then squeeze it again you can make this any way you like your pizza it also reheats very well for leftovers thanks for this great recipe
easy and delicious i added some leftover mushrooms to the beef and onions and some black pepper
whole family loves this casserole many come back for seconds
very simple and tasty i think i might experiment with more toppings next time
very good my husband and toddler went back for seconds will try adding mushrooms to sauce next time
delicious i don39t care for zucchini or hamburger but this was great you can mostly taste cheese yum also depending on how you fix up the tomato sauce it adds nice flavor i added some red pepper as suggested i also liked the green peppers on top the crispness was a nice contrasti would liken the bottom layer to an egg bake consistency and taste
was delicious mine came out a little soggy but perhaps i didn39t get all the moisture out of the zucchini
i made this and the next day it was all gone love it
we really enjoyed this i was concerned about putting a whole green pepper on top of the cheese so i put most of it in with the beef and onion to cook i also added some italian seasoning and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes
this was amazing i have been looking for recipes that taste delicious but don39t have the typical carbs like pizza crust or lasagna noodles and this was perfect i will be adding this to my list of favorites for sure
love it and i don39t like zucchini actually used some thai squash i had no idea what to do with tried some of the suggestions the sausage pepperoni and mushrooms and really like the result
this was an awesome recipe i used mushrooms instead of the green pepper and am going to try some pepperoni next time a keeper
went together well tasted great i would be very sure to really squeeze out the shredded zucchini mine was a little too moist but still was great
this is one of my favorite ways to use fresh zucchini and the abundance of banana peppers from the garden
delicious my family39s response 34you better double this next time34 great way to get those veggies in for people who may not like zucchini we did make one change used pork sausage instead of ground beef
this is a fantastic recipe great way to use zucchini wasn39t much left for leftovers
yummy i used frozen shredded zucchini and just drained the liquid i used ground turkey and red pepper and even my picky son liked it
yummy
has anyone tried freezing one
everyone love it we served it with olives and sour cream on the side yum
delicious and super easy to make
this is a great way to use all that zucchini from the garden yum
i have made this several times over the years it39s delicious as is i usually halve it for our smaller family also it39s delicious to bake the zucchini base and sprinkle on top diced chicken green and red peppers onion olives and salsa to taste i use about 1 cup for half the recipe to make a mexican pizza yum
i treated just like a pizza and added to the top mushrooms onions the green pepper and turkey pepperoni it was great i took it to a dog show and came home with an empty dish to make it healthy i used turkey pepperoni and turkey sausage and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce
this is delicious and i love that it uses an entire big zucchini my whole family loved it and i will make it again i thought the bottom was a little soft and next time i make it i will try adding a couple tablespoons of cornmeal to the zucchini mixture with the hopes of it becoming like polentamarylynhope
wow this recipe is very delicious i made a couple of changes by using italian sausage instead of hamburger and i added hot peppers to the top i like spicey food so it turned out perfectly will definately make this again thanks
great i think you could use italian sausage or ground turkey and i would add more onions and more green peppers next time i will also use some reduced fat cheese to cut calories somewhat i also threw in somme fresh basil into the sauce and will add even more next time
i tried this out for a potluck dish everyone enjoyed amp was wanting the recipe will make again
this was very good i think next time i will use some spicy chicken sausage instead of the ground beef it was a nice alternative to our regular zucchini dishes
hi i lived in belgium all my live and we ate leekes every day in soeps as a vegetebel in cheese pei we simmer the leek in butter and add some salt and pepper its just plein goed we also ate tem because there goed for your kidneys
this was very tasty i didn39t have italian tomato sauce so i cooked the ground beef amp onion with 2 cloves minced garlic 12 tsp basil amp oregano some salt crushed red pepper amp paprika i only used 1 can of tomato sauce and added a can of extremely well drained i actually squeezed handfuls out diced tomatoes delish
made this tonight dh says 39it39s a keeper39my changes i used frozen shredded zucchini so didn39t need the salt to draw the watersauteed the green pepper with beef and onionsprinkled sliced ripe olives on top of the meat sauce before putting on the cheeseswhen cheeses melted as it cooked the olives peeked thru will be making this again hope somebody gives us zucchini as i thought we had so much frozen from last year that we didn39t plant any this year jan
absolutely delicious fantastic as leftovers also
this was really a great way to use up the zucchini in the garden it was delicious because my family really likes cheddar cheese i used a cup of cheddar on the top with the mozzarella everyone enjoyed it i also made just the base without the top and served it with a chicken dinner went over well
we have made this zucchini pizza casserole 3 times already this summer we loved it could probably freeze some grated zucchini and make it this winter too thanks from nebraska
i found this recipe as i had some fresh zucchini to use up it turned out wonderfulit is definitely a keeper my husband and toddler both loved it the only thing i did different was sauteed my onion and green pepper and then cooked my meat and used my favorite spaghetti sauce it was absolutely delicious
this dish is 34to die for34 we did not plant garden this year but our neighbor provided us with an ample supply of zucchinisincerely
pthis is quite literally the best recipe i have ever found i am looking it up for the 30th time as it has been requested for a birthday dinner tomorrow by now i should have it memorized it does not disappoint p
this recipe is very close to the one i39ve used all my nearly 58 years of marriage it is in my better homes amp gardens cookbook i received as a shower gift mine calls for tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and either ricotta or cottage cheese not both i have a lasagna pan which is a bit deeper than the traditional 9x13 and it fills the dish everyone loves it when i serve it
i followed exactly i found the sauce to acidic from the tomato paste so i added more sugar and adjusted seasonings there was plenty of meat sauce and so my 9x13 pan was filled to the top as described i did use no boil noodles with excellent results the recipe turned out delicious why others didn39t like it is just personal opinion the recipe is a keeper
i39ve been making this lasagna for years ever since i saw it in one of the contest winner books i especially love the meat sauce which i use for other recipes now i have since been required to go gluten free celiac but i39ve adapted it to the gluten free noodles this is just delicious
this is the very best lasagna i have ever eaten it is my goto lasagna recipe and the only one i have made since discovering this recipe in toh magazine years ago my six boys love this too i suggest that you buy the best quality ingredients you can afford and buy the preshredded the cheese yourself it makes a big difference love this
absolutely delicious everyone loved it was wondering if anyone has made ahead and froze if so any advice
it doesn39t seem to have much sauce what would you add to get more
i39ve been making this lasagna for many years since i first discovered it in a taste of home cookbook it39s delicious and worth the effort i39ve tried other lasagnas but they don39t compare to this one
tastes delicious 34traditional34 or not
don39t call it 34traditional34 and include cottage cheese what a disaster
made this 3 times now i love this recipe delicious
as with any recipe one tends to adjust to their own taste that being said toh altered my original submission of this recipe i don39t do all those layers and use only 2 layers of noodles 6 total i continue to adjust my recipe twenty years later isn39t that what all cooks do as we learn one thing i will say is you must use fresh ingredients to get the best results like shred the mozzarella preshredded cheese contains chemicals that keep the cheese from caking and does affect the results also don39t use cheap ingredients garbage in garbage out if you use preprocessed ingredients don39t blame the recipe i recently found a true italian grocery and used their home made goat cheese ricotta and was amazed at the difference that made in regards to the saucei have learned that weather like humidity actually makes a difference i purposely make a thick sauce so the layers 34stay in place34 as i dislike runny lasagne again personal preference thank you all for your comments and enjoy
would be better without the cotton cheese and the provolone in my opinion and more spices
very good recipe but not enough spice very blandtoo many noodles left over and not enough ricotta sauce to fill last layer i make lasagna so i followed the recipe exactly as it said
amazing recipe my family loves their italian food and i was so nervous to make dinner for them i found this recipe and have never looked back the only thing i do different is i have equal parts of ricotta and cottage cheese about 2 cups each as we prefer a thicker consistency to really hold it together thank you so much
i39ve made this lasagna several times and it is fantastic this is now my goto lasagna recipe for special occasions i39ve made it for christmas eve a few times and am planning to make it again this year for christmas day i love this recipe
this is just what lasagna should taste like rich and delicious and like a warm food hug the sauce is incredible even more so after adding a 14 cup of red wine added lots more tomato sauce after reading other reviews and it definitely was needed worth the effort to put such a tasty dish out for the family
this recipe is amazing and worth 5 stars it is very close to a secret family recipe i have used for more than 50 years yes you can use no boil noodlesif you must but give this recipe a low rating if you do and find it quite meet your expectations make the recipe using the ingredients as written you be sorry
this is the 3rd time i have made this recipe and my family loves and i use the sauce as any marinara sauce i need a question to the author and readers i just caught today the recipe calls for 3 8 oz cans of sauce i had never noticed they were 8 oz cans and have been using the standard 15 12 i could not imagine this with less was the 8 oz cans a typo or is that how everyone has been preparing regardless of the answer i will stick to the 3 larger cans but i am curious
can this be made with no boil lasagne noodles
edit to my last review change cans of sauce to ro39s sensitive jar sauce
best lasagna ever my family loves it
so a couple of things 1 my family loves the meat sauce you make here so much we use it like a marinara all the time 2 i have made this a couple times the only change is i use less cottage cheese exampletotal of ricotta and cottage cheese is about 4 cups so i do 2 of eacha better balance for us
i spent two years in the toscana region of italy the italian snobs in here have no clue that this is actually better than any lasagna to be found in firenze florence bologna or milano milan cottage cheese my first thought was are you kidding me but after trying it i will concur that it is better than ricotta alone salud
i finally got to make this recipe to the t and it is amazing my little girl who eat any kind of combined foods loves it and asked me to make some again tonight thank you for sharing this awesome recipe
best ever
i39ve made this recipe for years and it has always been a big hit this recipe screams traditional american lasagna in the very best way it39s very difficult to mess this one up as i have not always had every ingredient it calls for on hand provolone sausage ricotta etc i love seeing how everyone has put their own spin on it and it still comes out beautifully
i don39t care if this is traditional italian lasagna or not what is important to me is that it tastes good this looks like my long lost recipe for lasagna that i made in the 7039s i got it off a box of pasta i am so glad to have found it again i can39t wait to make it
love
i ran across this recipe and it reminded me of my older cousins lasagne once i made it the first time it became my go to guide on layering and the cottage cheese ands ricotta sauce i use my own recipe for the sauce and i think the next time i39ll make it how i did as a young adult with burgundy in it oh so good
love the use of provolone cheese i added a little more sauce
delicious recipe used it more than once i always make just a little more sauce sauce lovers and one additional comment to martin
i was wary using pork sausage but what a great flavor it added to this dish this was a big hit with the family
love it i typically use more ricotta and less cottage cheese because it39s hard to find an 8 oz container of ricotta i prefer italian sausage to plain pork sausage glad there is no onion because my daughter can39t tolerate them yum
i am making this right nowbuti need someone to explain the reason for provolone cheese isn39t to dry
i changed 3 things no sugar used ricotta cheese
this recipe is absolutely amazing i found this recipe 4 years ago when i had moved out on my own into my new house this is my fourth time making it and it seems to get better every time good job taste of home
absolutely delicious this was the best lasagna i have ever made the tomato sauce was amazing i made it exactly as written i thought the seasoning would be a tad bland as it didn39t seem like enough for the amount of sauce i was wrong it was perfect just the way it was i haven39t used sausage in my lasagna before and it will now be my norm this will be my goto recipe from now on thanks taste of home
i just have 1 question can this particular recipe be made with no boil lasagna noodles
i was so surprised by how delicious this lasagna turned out to be i39ve now made it 3 times and now it39s my favorite i made it exactly as written
lasagna is not a dish that originated in italy so this is american lasagna and it39s delicious it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be lasagna comes from the greeks i actually make a greek lasagna better known as pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef but when i want american lasagna i make this recipe did you know the brits actually found a recipe for lasagna from the 139039s each country has perfected their own claim to lasagna fame when the italians make it in northern italy they do not use ricotta cheese they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella ricotta is used in the southern region only this is why many italians in america use ricotta most are descendants from southern italians so even mario or giada is making it wrong if you are from tuscany
real chefs will tell you to try their recipe and feel free to take the recipe and put your own spin on it using ingredients you like martin you are out of line with your criticism i have eaten a similar lasagna at the home of italian friends how many times have you heard real chefs say traditional recipes will be different depending on the region of italy it came from so why don39t you learn to keep your opinions to yourself and comment on the recipe only if you made it seeing your displeasure with the ingredients i doubt that39s going to happen so keep it to yourself love your comment bldrblue
delicious
if you look at the ingredient list the noodles are cooked and drained before assembling the dish
don39t you just love the smell of pomposity in the morning this recipe specifically states that it is american lasagna that differentiates it from italian lasagna but i have always found that rather than disparage a recipe because of your purist tastes or dismissing it out of hand try it different people like different things i quite like both this version and the ones made in italian kitchens you will find differences in recipes from your own mario and giada and i39m not sure i would rank either of them among the world class of chefs that you seem to suggest they are martin i would also note that some of the best cooking came from the kitchens of 34housewives34 unbelievable
i have made this recipe since it appeared 18 years ago it is absolutely the best no matter what the negative reviews say just try it and make it exactly as it is written i was skeptical but after making it the family loved it hands down and i39m a particular cook make it and try ityou39re family will love it
absolutely the best lasagne i have ever eaten hands down will never make another recipetruly fantastic
awesome base recipe i didn39t have provolone so just used extra mozzarella will try provolone next time i also added mushrooms and an onion this was so yummy
i have always par boiled my lasagna noodles and your recipe doesn39t require that step will the 50 min cooking then 20 min additional uncovered accomplish that i live in a very small town in ne arkansas and our 1 grocery store doesn39t carry ricotta so may i add more cottage cheese and would i still use egg then i was plan on making for dinner tonight thank you for sharing your recipe looks delicious
this is the best lasagna ever i don39t use pork sausage i just add a few fennel seeds to my sauce to give a little sausage flavor
best ever
best i have ever ever had soooooo good
took a huge chance and made this for the first time for our christmas dinner and it was wonderful it looked intimidating with such a long list of ingredients but it went seamlessly i was also afraid it had too much cheese in it but i couldn39t and wouldn39t change a thing a keeper for sure
i was using a different lasagna recipe on this site but having tried this one there39s no going back i made it exactly as stated but i used mild italian sausages out of their casings and a full package of smoked provolone this was one decadent cheesy saucy meaty lasagna and i have had nothing but rave reviews from friends and family and requests to please make this again best ever
wow susan that is so rude to rate a recipe that you even bother to try because you are some kind of lasagna snob if the recipe is your just pass on by and find recipes more to your liking some of us are more interested in the food than in the tradition you use to make your lasagna
i so love the substitution of cottage cheese i much prefer it to ricotta as i think ricotta tastes kind of dry great recipe
we love this recipe amazing
i followed the recipe to the t but when i took the lasagna out it look right going to let it stay in the oven uncovered for so more time and come back over i taste it
omg this recipe is amazing i followed all the directions and it was delicious thank you
this is hands down the best lasagna recipe i have ever tried my husband and sons both loved it the recipe was very simple and i was worried that it would not be very flavorful but this was perfect the sauce was amazing and the cheese mixture was fantastic many lasagna recipes turn out very runny but the cheese mixture in this was just right i used the lasagna noodles that don39t require cooking and made sure to allow the lasagna to sit on the counter for 15 minutes before cutting this will now be our lasagna recipe from now on thank you for sharing lorri
i don39t usually write reviews but i just had to i did add a cup of cabernet red wine to the sauce but other than that kept to the recipe my husband isn39t much on pasta but he raved about this lasagna on the 3 bite and went back for seconds it was truly delicious i think i will make it for our family christmas this year
look no further by far the best lasagna recipe easy and delicious
this is truly a 5star recipe the best lasagna that i have ever eaten the only tweak that i made was substituting seasoning salt for regular salt besides that i followed it to a 34t34 the whole family raved about it thanks for another winner
this is wonderful the addition of provolone cheese make it
yes must agree one of the best i have ever tried did leave out the cottage cheese though added extra ricotta instead delicious
love love love this recipe it is so delicious everyone raves over it will never make another lasagna recipeever
one of the best lasagna39s i39ve had i changed the beef and pork to only italian sausage it was delicious
this will be my go to lasagna from now on perfect served it christmas eve to rave reviews from family and friends
this has to be the best lasagna i have ever had only thing i changed is i used 1lb hot italian sausage and 12lb gr beef amazing flavors i love the provolone in this this is my first time not popping a jar for the sauce and i will never go back thank you for sharing this recipe
pat milo try it with real mozzarella and ricotta cottage cheese cannot compare you can leave out the meat we like it without meat
made this last week it was the best lasagna i have ever made so said hubby only changes i made was to use italian sausage instead of the pork and no boil noodles i did add about a cup of water to the sauce to provide enough moisture for the noodles the recipe is a keeper yes it takes longer to cook but so worth the effort
emily and graysmommy it might not be a bad idea to stick with take out if you can39t make this delicious lasagna
made this yesterday i used 24 oz pasta sauce with basil instead of plain tomato sauce i also added 1t oregano used nonboil lasagna assembled everything a day ahead and cooked it 50 minutes and refrigerated it covered tightly the next day i warmed it 20 minutes at 250 and 10 minutes at 350 until the edges bubbled a bit it was a huge hit next time i will use real mozzarella cheese and shred it myself but this time i didn39t have the energy for that i think it will make it a 6 star if it has real cheese instead of the prepacked shredded cheese which has fillers this photo is a bit deceptive my pan was filled to the top
made this today for all of my familyeveryone loved it thanks for sharing the recipe
i have been making this recipe for years yearround it can39t be beat when i don39t have ricotta it39s still wonderful
finally i have an amazing lasagna recipe made this just recently and everyone raved i had leftovers the next day and it even tasted better and emily i39m sorry but you had to do something wrong to give it negative reviews
this is a disaster too long cooking waste of time and money
i can39t wait for christmas i will surely prepare this lasagna for dinner with the use of bentilia to substitute the noddles used for healthier christmas eve dinner and of course to enjoy the dinner without hearing the kids complain
can this dish be made the night before
really great traditional recipe exactly what you need when you want a true down home lasagna recipe
this is my goto lasagna i really like the sauce i use mild italian sausage instead of bulk pork sausage and usually make a double recipe i save the extra to use on spaghetti it39s a great recipe for entertaining i make all the components ahead and just assemble and bake
i make mine the same way you do only i don39t use any ricotta cheese it makes it to dry for my taste
this is a very good recipe but i39ve now made it several times with and without the sausage and we think it39s better without the sausage since it39s less greasy i just add a little of the traditional sausage spices to the grind beef and increase the ground beef lean proportionately we make it about nice a month these day sometimes more often in winter
my first time making lasagna i followed the recipe except i used store bought spaghetti sauce my family really enjoyed this dish
how do you freeze this cooked or uncooked
always a hit with this recipe it also freezes well
i39ve made this lasagna several times now love it last night i served it to my dinner guests and even the person who said he hated lasagna ate a great big helping this really does make a lot so i suggest that you use a nice deep lasagna pan i made some simple additions to suit our tastes a half cup of diced onions sauteed with the meat a 10 ounce jar of sliced mushrooms drained and i increased the sausage to one pound i also increased the tomato sauce to 30 ounces extra mozzarella on every layer perfecto helpful hints add the top layer of cheese after you uncover the lasagna so it doesn39t stick to the foil and in response to several questions about the sausage recommendations are to use ground italian sausage not pork breakfast sausage or sausage links i made the mistake of using pork breakfast sausage the first time i made this and the taste totally overwhelmed it yikes
pi absolutely love it ive made this the first time with beef and mild italian sausage this time i used ground turkey and mild italian sausage i actuallu think i liked it better this timeand i normally hate ground turkey i did tweek it though instead of mozzarella and provolone i use a 5 or 6 cheese italian blend i also use sharp jack and colby i use 15 ounces of ricotta and two eggs instead of three today i added a little chicken broth to loosen it up a bit it wasn39t soupy the seasonings i changed up a bit too in addition to italian i used a complete sazon seasoning and adobo classico traditional sause and diced tomatoes with oregano and basil i sauteed garlic and shallots i love love love the cottage cheese it gives the ricotta a little kick i must now use that cheese mixture in some homemade ravioli yummmmp
okay so i substituted garlic for the powder and also the beef for ground turkey and instead of spicy sausage i used mild and it was great well the meat sauce i have my lasagna in the ovenext right now but i39m sure it39ll be great
very good lasagna i used ground turkey instead of hamburger and could not tell the difference i missed the ricotta cheese but the recipe was quite good without it my 9x13 pan was full without the ricotta i also had 2 cups of extra sauce left over
this lasagna is really yummy i substituted spicy italian sausage and a bottle of garlic meat tomato sauce instead of plain tomato sauce as well as italian flavored tomato paste since i dont have italian seasoning one thing that i blundered on was the garlic ive never cooked with garlic before so i accidently put 2 whole garlic bulbs instead of 2 cloves so it was very garlicy still yummy though and would be 10x better with the recipe amount im on my mobile and the star selection is acting up so in case it doesnt say this 5 stars for this lasagna
made this for my son39s soccer team and again for a dinner party with my husband39s work colleagues and both times i received rave reviews for this dish even my picky 9year old loved this lasagna this will be my goto recipe for lasagna
this is the best lasagna i have ever eaten it took a little time to put together but it was worth every minute to assemble
this recipe is very good added a few ingredients to this recipe i added 14 cup of fried fennel 12 cup of caramelized onion a pound if fried muhrooms and some extra virgin olive oil and 2 14 oz cans of fire roasted dice tomatoes i only used one small can of tomato pasteturned out excellent with a very zesty taste to the sauce yum
i made this for my husband39s birthday and the family loved it my sonsinlaw wanted seconds and some to take home i made two recipes worth so that i could do that i39m thankful that the note said that the pan would be 34full34 i was concerned but it fit and there was no boil over i especially enjoyed the layer of provolone cheese that was something i had not seen in any other recipe
this recipe is very similar to one called 34my famous cheesy heavyduty lasagna34 the one difference is the meat i used 1 12 lbs ground chuck and 14 lb bulk italian pork sausage with 12 diced onion added to the meats then drained off the grease i also used 316oz cans hunts tomato sauce and 1 6oz can tomato paste i used 2 tsp of italian seasoning and 12 tsp salt for the cheese i used a 16 oz block of mozzarellashredded by hand instead of the 12 oz in the recipe i also added a pkg of kraft italian 5cheese finely grated to the top when it is uncovered i baked at 350 degrees for 60 minutes then uncovered and baked 15 minutes more with the added cheese this is a very good lasagna recipe but be sure to bake in a lasagna pan as it does not fit into a 13 x 9 pan
my husband made this lasagna last night and it was so delicious and by far the best lasagna we have ever eaten other recipes don39t even come close we have 3 young children who all raved over it and our daughter even brought some to school in her thermos for lunch it made plenty for a family of 5 still have a few pieces left over but they won39t make it till the end of the day my husband ate 3 pieces for dinner on his own grab some italian bread and make this recipe you39ll be so happy you did 10 yummy stars
i am a terrible cook and i found this to be easy and delicious i would definitely recommend it
best i ever made or ate
made it for canada day my guests loved it
i had doubts that this was going to turn out because the sauce ended up very thick it was almost like a paste and i wasn39t even able to simmer it for the whole hour because i was afraid it was going to burn however the lasagna still tasted excellent even with the very thick sauce i think the next time i will maybe use a can of diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of sauce also i would wait to add the last layer of mozzarella cheese until after you uncover it because most of the top layer of cheese ended up on the foil when i removed it i also used the nocook noodles for this and they came out great
this is the best lasagna i have ever had i use the no cook noodles and it39s great
i hadn39t made lasagna in a very long time so i decided to look up a recipe i tried this one and it came out excellent based on the other reviews i did add 2 lbs of meat i used ground turkey instead of beef instead of 1lb and therefore used twice the amount of tomato sauce to compensate for the extra meat i also used a deeper pan and made 3 layers instead of two everyone thought it was delicious and i will definitely make it again thanks
i39ve been making this recipe for years amp i always get request for the recipe i found a cheese maker that makes extra sharp provolone cheeseif you can find it it39s well worth using in this recipe it gives it sharper bite amp tang you don39t get with regular provolone

best ever pauline nova scotia
made this for my date this weekend and it was amazing he doesn39t eat red meat so i replaced the ground beef with morning star crumbles and replaced the pork sausage with morningstar farms original sausage bought all horizon cheeses and made it completely 39humane39 animals used in recipe were organically fed free range and humanely slaughtered it was delicious
ex
yum perfect recipe thank you this was my first lasanga attempt your recipe was flawless
best lasagna ever
this is hands down the best lasagna i39ve ever tried my family is crazy about it wonderful recipe
made this for the first time tonight and loved it with a few changes made the meat my own way adding onions peppers and garlic to the meat and sausage mix and instead of tomato sauce and paste i used a large jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce which cut down the prep time the rest i followed exactly i let it rest for about 1 hour before cutting into it and just reheated pieces in the microwave this was a real hit at my home and i had plenty left over for the next day definitely will be making this again and may try adding hard boiled eggs to the meat this time
this lasagna was awesome if you are a cheese lover this is the recipe for you i added chopped onion and mushrooms in and let them saute with the meat because i like more than just meat in my sauce and the flavor was to die for hands down best lasagna i have ever made
i39ve made at least 50 different versions of lasagna this is hands down the best by far i followed the recipe
yummy my family requests this at least once a month if not twice love it
this is by far the best lasagna i have ever made and quite possibly the best i39ve ever eaten restaurants included one thing i really like about the recipe is the stepbystep layering directions they make it very easy to put this delicious dish together
horrible recipe i am actually quite surprised it turned out so horribly i spent 30 on all the ingredients and almost knew it would turn out amazing due to all the great reviews and five star rating there was not nearly enough sauce to call it lasagna the flavors were way too strong and the pork sausage was the wrong choice there was also not enough lasagna noodles in this recipe so many things i didn39t like about this dish what a waste of food and time don39t waste your time
this is absolutely delicious only change i did was use half cottage cheese and half ricotta of the total 32 ounces of both
wonderful lasagna i too used oven ready lasagna perfect
did you know that you do not have to cook the lasagna noodles they turn out just fine
this was easy to make and so goodit39s a keeper
i must say i was surprised how well this turned out every lasagna recipe i39ve ever tried always came out on the flavorless side but this recipe did not everyone was surprised that there was cottage cheese in the lasagna which i feel helps the taste granted i had to adjust the ingredients a little since a person in my family has sensitivities to what is in italian seasoning but a pepper and onion sausage and a little extra salt and sugar did the trick with the saucedefinitely a keeper
oh my gosh is this good love the layer of provolone and this is the first time i made lasagna with both cottage and ricotta cheese i added a little more ricotta than the recipe calls for and it turned out sooooooo good this is my new lasagna recipe
there were 8 of us for dinner and we finished the entire pan dh asked if we could make it again in january we used sweet italian sausage a 29 oz can of tomato sauce and an additional 15 oz can of diced tomatoes we did have some sauce that wouldn39t fit in the pan however so the extra sauce and tomatoes were probably not necessary we39ll probably do it as written next time
my picky husband rated this an 8 out of 10 and this says a lot based on the reviews i added a can of diced tomatoes with its juice it was perfect
this was fantastic i didnt add any salt but other than that i didn39t change a thing
super salty next time i will not add the salt the recipe calls for and i39ll also use 34no salt added34 tomato sauce and paste i think minus the over salty taste this would be really good
it39s still in the oven but am i the only one who thought there wasn39t enough meat mixture in one cup to cover the bottom of the 9x13 baking dish
i liked this recipe and would have given it a 5star rating but the meat sauce was too dry i added a cup of beef broth during the last half hour and it was fine
the best lasagna i39ve ever made or eaten a perfect 10 from the whole family
i39ve been making lasagna for over 40 years for my family but decided to update the taste and ran across this recipe in taste of home a couple years ago i use this recipe exclusively now it39s very meaty with the beef and pork and that is the best combination the seasoning and combination of cheeses is perfect i had my doubts about the use of cottage cheese but it cooks down so there are no curds and keeps the lasagna from drying out i made this a number of times and it comes out perfect every time i call that foolproof
my husband and i really loved this lasagna the only change i will make is to cut down on the cheese
i usually go with jar sauce to save time but wanted to make an extra special dinner for family staying with me this recipe was awesome so good they could not stop bragging thank you taste of home
made this for dinner last night i must say one of the best lasagna i have ever had or made followed the recipe with few changes added 23 cup red wine to the sauce to make it a little more saucier and used no cook lasagna noodles the second time i made it had my in laws visiting so made it the day before and took it out of the fridge 4 hours before baking still as awesome as the first time amp using the no cook lasagna noodles this is a keeper in my recipe bookthank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with all of usferryal
made this for dinner tonight it was awesome
i have a question do you remove the skins from the sausages or cook them whole or cut up
loved it my boyfriend said it was the best lasagna he39s ever had and that39s saying something
i39ve made this delicious recipe before and am going to try making five trays of it this weekend for a big gathering this time i39m going to try ovenready lasagna noodles to save time keeping my fingers crossed that it will work has anyone else tried these noodles
my family loved this lasagna so so so good
best lasagna in the world
i just followed the recipe as given and it was a big hit i might try a little more of the meat sauce next time
perfect
i used 2 lbs of hamburger 1 lb of italian sausage and added an additional 15 oz of tomato sauce my family loved it in fact my husband said this is the best dish ever will definitely make it again
i am coming back online again to get this recipe i have tried other recipes over the years but always come back to this one when i am having company and want my lasagna to taste just right
just began creating this dish i39ve never made lasagna by myself before so i39m hoping my dad and younger sisters enjoy this for dinner tonight did not have cottage cheese so i doubled up on ricotta also did not have provolone hopefully it39s still good
i too have tried for years to get the perfect lasagna i found this one last winter and have been making it exactly as it says since i printed it off and laminated it i have been asked many times to share it i always have some in the freezer now it is so easy to freeze i wait until the next day and cut it to portion sizes and wrap them individual in saran and then place them in a ziplock bag in freezer i often share these portions with seniors and shutins
the ricotta cheese is what makes this dish so fantastic i love to add additional shredded cheese however on the top delicious this also freezes well
i first tried this recipe from my taste of home cookbook a few years back it has become a family favorite it really is easy to make and has such great flavor i make it a few times during the year especially during the cold winter months i39ve also tried it with jar sauce but it39s just not the same i39ve also used my own homemade sauce from cooking down tomatoes which is to die for i loaned my cookbook to my sil and have not gotten it back yet so i39m so glad it39s included in the online recipes my husband has been craving 34the best lasagna ever34 as he calls it he39s so right definitely a 5 star recipe
after 44 years of trying to make my husband happy with lasagna i finally nailed it i didnt make the sauce sunce prego is our favorite i have made many home made sauces in my cooking career and we always go back to prego it saves time in the kitchen i used asiagoparmesan instead of just pamesan excellent
i added some v8 juice as needed to thin the sauce while it simmered for the hour i added onion green pepper fresh mushrooms bay leaf extra garlic and italian seasoning and towards the end of the hour some fresh basilto the layers i added one of fresh spinach i am so glad i found this recipe i have made it twice once with beef and sausage and once with beef and plain ground pork both were awesome thank you for this recipe
i made this for new year39s day dinner and it was a hit this will be my go to recipe for lasagna i had italian sausage so used that instead of the pork sausage and it turned out great
easy to fix the sauce had good flavor
awesome quick and easy and very filling the taste is what made my family a lasagna lover
i first made this recipe for a new year39s day gathering of family amp friends in 2010 amp it was a hit with everyone i substituted 4 cups of ragu traditional spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce mixture in order to save time i also occasionally substitute sliced or bulk pepperoni for the bulk pork sausage we enjoy the variety of cheeses i39d never seen that before it39s a favorite
i made this yesterday because my inlaws were coming and everyone liked it a lot i didn39t change anything except i used dried parsley instead of fresh didn39t have fresh a definite keeper even my extremely picky 12yearold cleaned her plate
this was a truly delicious lasagna i used hot italian sausage because my family likes a bit of kick in their meals but there is really nothing i would change about this recipe it is definitely a keeper
i am still in the process of making this so my star rating is not really fair however i am confused i went out yesterday and carefully selected all of the ingredients if you look at the ingredients list there is no mention of provolone then when you get to step 3 you are supposed to layer with provolone provolone is similar to mozzarella but the instructions call for provolone and mozzarella note the recipe also calls for 12 c of parmesan cheese no where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned finally the sauce is to be simmered for one hour unless you want it burned don39t plan on that it is very thick and i had to stop with nine minutes to go obviously this recipe was not kitchentested
the best
best lasagna recipe that i have found
by far the best lasagna i39ve ever eaten the whole family loved it takes some time to make but so worth it
yep as good as everyone says
wowdelicious made it for a party everyone loved it
awesome recipe it is the only one i use now
this was a great recipe it was easy to make and came out soooo good everyone loved it next time i39ll use hot sausage instead of sweet the sauce was tasty and it was the perfect amount of ricotta definitely let the sauce cook for an hour or more it makes a huge difference
the very best i used 1 12 ground beef and 12 sausage also added 12 c water and used 12 t garlic powder instead of cloves not a garlic fan no changes necessaryjust my taste my dinner guests agreed it39s the best ever once cut it stays in layers nicely too
excellent i cut out the sausage and used all ground beef this turned out perfect
excellent recipe and easy to make shared it with 3 friends and they were amazed and said 34this is what i call a real lasagna recipe34 of course i will continue making it thumbs up
great lasagna i used home made noodles for this dish super flavor and not difficult to prepare will definitely have again
i have not made this recipe but it sounds like a great way to make the cottage cheese mix in the lasagna 5 stars for creativity i can not wait to make it for my family
it is everything i want in a lasagna everyone in my family loves it
sooo yummy the sausage made for a wonderful flavor and i love how the sauce is simmered for an hour to get it nice and thick a lot of lasagna turns out wet and runny this one is perfect even my insanely picky husband liked it
i really enjoyed this recipe i felt that that the combination of ingrediants were great however i was not happy with the sauce itself i felt it was a little overwhelming and i am interested in other people39s comments and suggestions about the sauce i just felt it was a little too thick and too overpowering
i made this for christmas dinner amp got so many compliments the only change i made was i used 1 pound of italian sausage amp 12 pound of ground beef so yummy the leftovers didn39t last long you can39t fail with this recipe i made it the day before amp let the flavors mingle overnight then baked it the next day
this was absolutely delicious i added a touch of fine grated cheddar cheese with the mozzarella and used italian sausage served this dish for christmas as everyone was tired of ham and turkey my kids said this will be the new christmas tradition at our house
this is my goto recipe i39ve been making it for years and it39s even my inlaw family39s favorite and they are sicilian italian i usually do the beefsausage combo but i prefer just beef i always try to use all fresh ingredients including fresh mozzerella sometimes i will make it with just ricotta but it39s great both ways
i made this tonight for my family my kids just loved it i had to make it gluten free with the no boil gluten free noodles i think next time i will only use ground beef though other than that this is a great recipe
my go to lasagna dish so good no one has disliked it had to use all beef for some who can not eat pork and added saute onions
i have been making this recipe since it first came out in taste of home over a decade ago the only changes i39ve made over the years is to use a mix of hot amp sweet italian sausage plus i add about 14 jar prepared sauce to thin sauce just a bit on occasion when i have extra fresh basil i39ll add with parsley to cheeseegg mixture i always receive rave compliments with this dish ps i make a double batch and freeze one for the future no better recipe
best lasagna recipe i have found i will definitely make this again
this recipe is delicious my whole family loved it
hello lorri thank you so much for such a wonderful flavorful and tasty lasagna this is the best recipe it39s so good that i decided to make it for 150 people for my husbands 34customer appreciation night34 wow what was i thinking ha the lasagna was a big hit but i learned my lesson if i don39t have a double oven which i don39t and have a couple of friends to help me i39ll never attempt it again i ended up making 8 pans whew but it was all good thanks again
excellent i used itaillan sausage and 5050 ratio of cottage amp ricotta everybody loves
this recipe is by far the best lasagna i39ve eatten and i39m not much of a lasagna person i made the recipe asis the first time and the second time i tweaked it for a healthier version no meat so no simmering of the sauce ahead of time reducedfat ricotta cheese reduced fat provolone and a mix of 2 mozzarella and regular shredded mozzarella it still tasted fantastic definitely making this again
i add a few more seasonings but this is excellent
i39m making it right now d
the best lasagna i have ever had i did use italian sausage instead of plain but that was the only change i made so good
this is my second rating of this recipe this time i left out the sausage and only used hamburger meat i loved it this way and got many great comments too i would have increased my star rating from 3 to 5 but website won39t let me change my rating
my husband loved this recipe i have never used provolone in lasagna before it was great we have tried adding torn spinach as one of the layers comes out great
i used all ground beef instead of part pork sausageand we loved it seems i39ve been a short order cook around here with picky requests from kids but my seven and four year old oohed and ahhed over something this amazing made a batch for my inlaws who believed this was the best lasagna they39ve tasted completely worth the effort and extra time to put together will be making this again soon thanks so much for sharing this recipe
i loved this recipe i think it may be my 34go to34 lasagna recipe from now on i used 1 pound of pork sausage dried parsley and only simmered the pasta sauce for 30 minutes i recommend using a lasagna pan for this recipe as the 9x13 is too small
everyone in my family loved this recipethis is a keeper
this is very good the only tweak i made was to add minced onions and a bay leaf to the meat sauce perfection
we loved this recipe it turned out beautiful the only thing i did different was i didn39t simmer the sauce for 60min instead i simmered it for 30min also during the browning process i only did it for 15min instead of 20 i39m planning on making this for my parents this weekend thanks so much for the recipe
simply delicious everyone loved it
i had not made lasagna in a while and saw this recipe i am so glad i did it39s easy and heartily delicious i will definitely make this again
everyone in my family loves this recipe my mom even asked me for a copy because she likes it better than her39s
i followed recipe exactly and it was very good but i definitely will cut back on the garlic next time
this is my family39s tradition now i make this every christmas eve and everybody enjoys it i do not think it is difficult to make or time consuming
it requires a bit of work but totally worth it
made this for the family everyone raved about it i followed the recipe exactly very good
just tried this the other night unbelievably good everyone loved it
this has been my go to lasagna recipe since i discovered it in taste of home years ago i also use the sauce recipe for pasta
this was fun to make and delicious
i have been making this recipe since it was first published eleven years ago people always enjoy it even my italian motherinlaw likes it very easy recipe too highly recommend
awesome lasagna that makes even better leftovers well worth the time amp effort
three people in my family found this recipe at around the same time the entire family agrees that this is the best lasagna recipe available i don39t know that it would be considered a traditional lasagna by italian standards but we do not care it is our favorite easy to prepare and has the best of all lasagna recipes included in the ingredients i tend to add my own touches to recipes as i make them but not with this oneno 34improvements34 needed
i love this lasagna just love it so does everyone else in my family
i have made this lasagna for years no other lasagna compares to this one i follow the recipe to the letter every time and it turns out perfectly every time
i have made this lasagna several times and always get great reviews i use venison meat instead of beef simply because it is what we have on hand
so delicious no other lasagna even comes close to this one
i have made this several times and always get tons of compliments sauce is delicious
the very best
one word delicious
absolutely wonderful
good like it is i39m leaving this one alone
deliciously cheesy
best lasagna i39ve ever made my fiance always tells me all my other lasagna recipes have been bland but he loved this one gonna make it again this week
we love this lasagna we do all beef since we39re not big sausage fans it39s so delicious and has ruined us to other lasagna39s
i have made this lasagne many timesit is wonderful but not everyone likes sausagei replaced the sausage with ground pork and it was excellent
made this for my neighbors and they swore it was the best lasagna that they have ever had
before trying this recipe i have always made the same family recipe i had watched my parents make for years i never have liked many other recipeswell i saw how popular this recipe is here so i tried it amazingly good i am afraid to tell my parents for fear of hurting their feelings the only thing i did differently because of lack of exact ingredients was to substitute pizza sauce for the tomato sauce and replaced the italian seasoning with a mixture of basil and oregano it was the best lasagna i have ever eaten i will probably cut back on the sauce a bit next time this lasagna is everything everyone says it is perfecto
this is my second rating of this recipe this time i left out the sausage and only used hamburger meat i loved it this way and got many great comments too i would have increased my star rating from 3 to 5 but website won39t let me change my rating
the meat sauce ended up very thick but still delicious i left out the provolone and used dried parsley instead of fresh also i used an aluminum lasagna pan so overflow wasn39t a problem
the prep time on this dish was a little more than i expected i will admit that i didn39t read the recipe closely at first but the lasagna was worth the wait it39s a mild flavored dish sure not to offend anyone we enjoyed it but i39ll probably add spinach and mushrooms next time to add a little more interest all in all it39s definitely something i39d serve to the inlaws
wow this will be my lasagna recipe that i will always use so good
this was a huge hit this is the best lasagna recipe
i absolutely love this recipe it39s soooo filling and delicious that it is also a hit when i make this for parties or dinner definitely worth the time to put this all together for my friends and family
best lasagna i have ever made
love it love it and love it i took this lasagna to a pot luck and it was the hit of the night i didn39t change a thing
i love lasagne
the is the best lasagne recipe ever i had my family over and wanted to try a new recipe that would feed a large group lots of compliments and asking where i got the recipe really easy but kind of long process to make followed the recipe exactly as written will definately make this one againsoon
this was the lasagna recipe that i have been looking for great flavor and cheesy this recipe is a winner yes it is a blue ribbon contest winner i use 12 hot italian and 12 mild italian sausage for the port sausage so good
this is a family favorite i don39t like chunks of tomatoes so this is a winner sometimes i add pepperoni as well
this is a fantastic lasagna i used a foil pan so it wouldn39t spill on the way to my inlaws it did not dry out at all i would make this again
this was the best lasagna i have ever made it was wonderful i had family over for dinner and they loved it
my boyfriend always orders lasagna from the olive garden this recipe was a big hit with him he thought it was better than the olive garden very delicious
delicious this recipe is great and easy the only thing i had to change was the cooking time since i made it earlier in the day it had been in the refrigerator so i took longer than the 50 minutes to cook so just make sure you adjust your cooking time if needed but a really delicious recipe
great lasagna one of the bestif not the best
this is an excellent recipe this is also the first successful lasagna recipe that i have made my guy absolutely loved it the only thing i did was double the sauce and the amount of mozarella there was plenty of sauce left over to make a small lasagna or to use for spaghetti sauce
i made this for my husband tonight he was speechless and let me say that doesn39t happen very often tasted great will definitely make again will love the leftovers it gave us
very good it will be the only lasagna i will ever make from now on
i made it two times already and everyone loves it this sat i39m making it again for a bridal shower i39m hosting thank you
this recipe is a keeper i was looking for some new ideas to enhance my usual way of making lasagna i really likes all the reviews of this recipe and i liked the ingredients wow this is really good i made the tomato sauce a day ahead of time and it tasted sooooo good i could hardly leave it alone only changes i made were adding 2 extra garlic cloves and using jenno39s hot italian sausage in place of the sausage this is now my new recipe
the best home made lasagna ever
i have made this a number of times this is the best lasagna recipe i have come across so far i have been making this recipe for years
this is the best lasagna recipe i have come acrossi have modified it a bit when i make it i only use one can of tomato paste i feel that when you use two it has too much of a metallic taste especially when eating leftovers and it also makes the sauce too thick and reheated leftovers are too dry i also use slightly more tomato sauce and use two 15 oz cans of sauce i am not a huge sausage fan so i usually omit the sausage and just use the 1 lb of beef
good recipebut to saucy for me next time will cut sauce back
i made this recipe for a family gettogether everyone said it was fantastic and i even got phone calls the next day about it i followed the recipe exactly as i wanted to see what i39d change not a thing i39ll never make another recipe after this it takes extra time but it39s well worth it
i make this lasagna on special occasions two or three times a year and every time i make it i get rave reviews it takes patience but it39s well worth it also the recipe freezes well i put mine in an 11x17 pan because its too much for a 9x13
great recipe
i made this lasagna for a small family gettogether it was really good but it is not a throwtogetheratthelastminute recipe but i would definitely make it again
i39ve made this many times it39s fantastic
this was the first lasagna recipe i39ve ever made i 2lbs of ground chuck instead of ground beef and pork sausage and it turned out great wonderful recipe
it was amazing my whole family loved it and my 4 yr old ask if we could have it every day
delicious i added chopped zucchini green peppers and mushrooms to the sauce
i tried this recipe yesterday for dinner my husband and family said it was delicious maybe the best lasagna he has eaten
this is the best lasagna recipe i have ever had i will not make anything else make sure you put a piece of foil or a cookie sheet under the baking dish because this is filled to the brim and tends to overflow
this is the best lasagna i have ever made i didn39t have any pork sausage meat so i used ground pork this is the recipe i will always make
this is the best lasagna recipe i have found it39s amazing
every time i have dinner guests this is my goto recipe if i have any left it also freezes well for later i also make mine in a larger pan to avoid overflow in my oven
this recipe is by far the best that i have ever used i don39t think i will ever use another lasagna recipe again
my friends and i agree that by far this is the best lasagna we have ever had i double the recipe and make them two at a time they freeze well uncooked
i have made this recipe for several holiday meals and also on sunday meals i get many compliments and it is the best lasagna recipe i have ever made my husband always orders lasagna when we eat out and he said this recipe tops them all
my family loved this recipe
my absolute favorite i usually make a double batch to freeze one pan for later
awesome
this recipe really is as fabulous as everyone says wanted to make vegetarian lasagna for my neighbor so substituted the meat for boca crumbles and boca sausage crumbled i love meat and i never would have known that it was vegetarian the flavor and textures were amazing truly the perfect lasagna
very tasty not hard to make i used the kind of noodles you dont need to boil before baking good for one less step
amazingly good my family prefers this recipe over my italianborn motherinlaw39s
this is the best lasagna recipe i have found the meat sauce and cheeses compliment each other very well
my entire family uses this recipe anytime that lasagna is craved we all discovered this recipe several years ago and stopped looking for any other lasagna recipe the only thing we look for now is to see which one of us is going to prepare the dish next love it
never made lasagna b4 this one reminded me of ones i grew up on i leave the sausage out and use premade spaghetti sauce tastes amazing everyone loves it it39s a crowd pleaser
love this recipe it has become a constant go to and the family loves it
i made this for the second time yesterday for my boyfriend and his roommates everyone loved it it is by far my favorite lasagna recipie
dear lorrithank you for this recipe i have made it every christmas eve for our family gettogether ever since it was first published in taste of home magazine everyone loves it and i love getting kudos for making itdebbie b
this has been our favorite lasagna recipe for years
i made this for dinner tonight and it was excellen
this is a keeper i decide whether to use vegetable vs chicken bouillon so did 1tsp of each the tsp of hot sauce is not optional in my opinion a must and no it make it spicy at all i also added maybe an 1814 tsp dry mustard to give it that background kick like in beer cheese soup 14 cup diced onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic into the veggies i used sharp cheddar for the most flavor amp it came out perfect normally always adding extra salt or bouillon to most soups but need to with this one it was plenty thick without blending any of the veggies
palways looking for a healthy soup that will be suitable for my glutenfree friend and my diabetic friend this was a winner easy to make hardest part was breaking up the cauliflower and delicious p
my granny god bless her use to serve this up to me decades ago and said its a poor man39s soup i made it myself today and was surprised how it tasted exactly the same as my granny made i also added whatever i had and put some sharp tasting parmesan cheese with the other shredded cheese i had and the taste was spectacular
this is a nice tasting cauliflower soup i really liked it and will make again
been making this soup for several years now i have added a chopped onion and a whole rotisserie chicken cut into bite sized pieces with the added ingredients i increase the water to at least 4 cups i do like the idea of adding red pepper flakes for added flavor my family loves this recipe
this is one of those comforting cozy kind of soups my family and i were very sick with covid a few months ago i was staying with my 19 month old grandson because my daughter and her husband were in the hospital having my granddaughter and due to some complications on top of them also having covid i was with him for almost a week many people dropped off meals and groceries for us i was so nauseated with the sickness and eat much of anything my mom made this for me using almond milk and it very much hit the spot it is literally all i could eat for days i have made it exactly as written and it was delicious with both milks
simple amp excellent recipe i see a lot of comments saying it was bland i definitely disagree i know it says hot pepper sauce optional i would add it for sure i used red hot
don39t let the name fool you this is terrific even though it is cauliflower instead of potato this soup is very tasty and easy to prepare i made it for christmas dinner and was told by multiple guests that they loved it too
i added bacon bits chili flakes and 2 tsp franks hot sauce turned out delicious with so much flavouri also mashed the caulflower before adding the cheese sauce definitely recommend this recipe yummmm
this was pretty bland i had added 2 diced chicken breasts and extra black pepper amp even some korean chili powder but that was not enough what really helped was sprinkling some green onions over the top of the soup after serving
excellent recipe i added bacon bits and now it tastes like loaded baked potato in soup form
i make this soup every winter it is one of my husband amp mine favorite i try to use also low fat cheddar or sharp cheese to cut more fat i also use sodium reduce better than bouillon if i have broccoli leftover from a prior dinner or have fresh will add it too
very very good i added half cream and half milk instead of just the milk a bit more pepper and used medium white cheddar and half a medium onion very very small chopped this is now one of my favorites thankyou jp
i made this recipe exactly as recipe said i tasted it and it was really really good i husband wanted cauliflower soup and this was the best don39t leave out the celery because that really adds a lot of flavor i am on a kick of using almond milk because it39s healthier than cream or half and half and it can stay in my fridge for 2 months whereas milk products need to be used the almond milk tastes no different the only thing i noticed was that it made so little soup so my review already said the recipe as stated is very goodbut i added 2 potatoes cooked drained and mashed with a little butter and added to the soup with 2 cups of water and 1 t soup base and 1 more cup of cheesewhen i go to the work of making a soup i want more than just a couple meals for the 2 of us
very tasty sautéed veggies in evoo and added onion and garlic added a little paprika and dry mustard pressure cooked everything non dairy for 5 minutes and a 10 min natural release made the roux according to directions and folded it in total hit next time i think i may add a splash of white wine or sherry and a potato
absolutely delicious
i really liked this recipe and so did most of my family i did make a few minor changes however first i sauteed onion in olive oil added the shredded carrot and cauliflower florets and sauteed for a few minutes with the onion then i added chicken stock instead of water after i added the cheese sauce to the cauliflower i used my immersion blender to make a more creamy thick soup i have bookmarked this soup and will definitely make it again
i made this tonight i also chopped up an onion with the other veggies it just feels wrong to cook without onions i sautéed the veggies a little bit with olive oil and epicure rosemary garlic seasoning then added in chicken broth instead of the water to finish i added in some buffalo hot sauce so good i will be making this again thanks for the recipe
i just made this soup and it is absolutely delicious made one change used vegetable broth instead of water to cook the vegetables it was so good i subscribed to the magazine
just made this tasty soup with the addition of dijon mustard and a small potato very satisfying with warm crusty bread
everyone who has had this enjoys it
this recipe is a place to start hard to imagine how boring it would be as written we roasted the vegetables added sauteed onion and a list of seasonings onion powder basil marjoram white pepper paprika and made it a little thicker and it was very good
this is absolutely my favorite kids think it39s bland but i love it i did add the hot sauce and put more in than required so good
liz i made it last night and used almond milk my husband loved it
i am eating leftover soup and just realized whats missing it needs a pinch of dry mustard
has anyone tried this with a milk substitute like almond milk i love creamy soups but family can have milk
glad i read the review of course i used what everyone before me did i sautéed onion garlic serrano pepper carrots and cauliflower then i added the liquids tasted fantastic
whole family enjoyed this soup
this may be one of the best soups i39ve ever tasted easy to make filling delicious and lots of veges
i thought this was good i added about a half of a vidallia onion finely chopped to the dutch oven with a couple of tbls of butter and let that cook for a few minutes before adding the rest of the veggies i let the veggies cook for a few more minutes tossing them together and adding salt and pepper before adding chicken broth 212 cups instead of water and omitting the boullion i then made the cheese sauce adding fresh nutmeg and then added the cheese sauce to the vegetables i did not add the hot sauce
i was disappointed easy to make but very bland even with hot sauce i added bacon and still no flavor
this was such an easy recipe and simply delicious i adjusted all measurements by half and it was just right for serving 2 of us i also used vegetable broth instead of water will be using this recipe again and again
easy recipe made a great hearty flavorful soup i will definitely make again
added garlic serrano pepper broccoli and an extra cup of cheese also find that cooking the veggies 1215 makes them too mushy cut the time in half i have made this a dozen times at least and just keep tweaking to my tastes of course everyone is different but a quick and inexpensive recipe so you can really just keep experimenting thank you for the recipe
i made this today having my daughter amp grands over for lunch it39s so tasty i did add sautéed onions amp garlic amp 12 of a hot pepper from the garden and then thinly sliced crimini mushrooms i39ll come back after lunch with a family update oh and this was my very first time making a rue and it was successful yay
made it today roommates raved have to try it again wonions love your recipes
made this tonight for the first time my husband and i loved it and my 7 and 4 year old too i did add 14 cup diced onion as others suggested i would imagine you could use this same base for broccoli or potato soup too
this is the best soup took to work and everyone wanted the recipe
i too added green onion and garlic turned out great kelly
making this soup tomorrow just wanted to reply to ninny54 the cheese is mentioned in the recipe toward the end maybe reread the recipe so know when to add it
i made this over the weekend because it was chilly out and really wanted a nice soup made as stated in the recipe but i think next time i will add some sautéed onions to it i did use my potato masher to break up the cauliflower into smaller pieces will definitely make again
hubby pronounced this 34very good34 even though he is not a soup lover i did add a chopped onion and because the head of cauliflower was quite large i added some extra celery and 1 extra carrot i used skim milk and added bergeron cheese instead of cheddar because that39s what was in the 39fridge this one goes into my 34good enough to serve to company34 recipe file
make this 45 times a year i do add chopped onion 14 cup of chopped celery what do i do with the rest of the celery stalk lol i think adding one celery stalk to the soup will be just fine maybe even more
absolutely deeeelicious and super easy
i use broth instead of water and double recioe so i can freeze for later so good
this is so good it is always requested in our house the only changes i use broth instead of water add 14 cup chopped onion to the carrot mixture and cayenne instead of hot sauce yum
my husband who doesn39t like cauliflower loved this recipe it is delicious
it was very good only thing is it got real thick what did i do wrong
9142020i39m just reading the email for this recipe sounds great but can someone please tell about the cheese mentioned in the instructions but not ingredients thanks
good recipe you need to add onion to your ingredient list and sauté the vegetables in butter first and then follow the rest of your recipe as written also just a pinch of nutmeg will really enhance the flavour
made it and he loveditthis is a very good soup
this is a really good 34base34 recipe good as is but you can customize to come up with something that is perfect for your taste i threw in a handful of smoked salmon just before serving and also ran half of it through the blender just to thicken a bit more salmon really kicked it up a notch i always follow a recipe the first time and go from there
this soup is so good i did use an emulsion blender to make chunks smaller my husband loved it
such an easy recipe and very healthy i added garlic and onions used 2 12 c chicken broth instead of water and excluded the chickenvegetable bouillon
you can use oat flour i am allergic to wheat and use oat flour it works great never miss the flour at all
they make the soup about once a month my favorite soup
good taste nice and easy to follow instruction even for non chefs
i love this soup the only things i add to it are both green and red pepper whole of each an onion a t of garlic and t cayenne pepper
i love this recipe
great basic recipe i added 2 teaspoons tuscan seasoning onion more celery more carrot minced garlic and more chopped celery yum
this soup was delicious and so quick and easy to make i didn39t have any soup stock on hand so i just used water and added a bunch of extra seasonings poultry seasoning garlic cayenne paprika etc right at the beginning it worked out really well and my whole family was happy with it
great recipe quick to make and delicious
this has been a family favourite for many years so quick and easy to make
best cauliflower soup ever going to add shrimp the next time
really wish people would rate the actual recipe rather than rate it with you and
this turned out very good i have made it twice i did use broth instead of bullion very easy to make
our favorite soup
this is now one of my favorite soups i always add a small can of green chilies in place of the hot sauce
i liked this recipe as is but i agree with a couple of the comments especially the one about the soup being bland as written so i made some slight modifications second time around which prospective cooks may want to consider i added a lot more carrots and celery around 1 cup of each plus two large finely diced garlic cloves i found the carrots and cauliflower cooked much faster than the celery the first time i made it so next time i added the celery to the soup base 3 minutes before adding the carrots and cauliflower i also added some cumin to the bechamel sauce i do like some kick to my soups so i added hot pepper sauce as directed the first time i used red pepper flakes second time as i thought the tabasco sauce turned the soup a bit too orange i like the suggestion to add some chopped onions as well i will try that next time just to keep tweaking the basic recipeas apparently that is what i do
i love this recipe i just tweak it a little bit by adding some chopped onion and some fresh minced garlic thanks taste of home
as i was making the soup i was wondering why there was no garlic or onion looking at the spices i only see salt and pepper i just knew this soup was going to be bland and i don39t want to make something and it not be great i melted the butter and added garlic and onion i also added crumbled bacon and cubed ham i used red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce i also thicken the soup more to get a more like a chowder consistensy i chopped in some fresh parsley just before serving after my changes i loved it
this is such a great recipe 1 because it39s mostly ingredients i keep instock 2 it39s easy 3 it39s delicious this one is worth saving and sharing
i love this soup but how are you getting 2 quarts out of 4 12 cups of liquid
mom and kid approved recipe was so easy and ingredients won39t break the bank the only tweeks i made were to omit the hot sauce and add 14 tsp red pepper flakes at the end i used an immersion blender to make it more soupy daughter told me i should make it every night and at only 159 calories per serving this recipe is a winner
susan don39t add the 34 tsp of salt and use lowsodium chicken broth if you are used to no salt this shouldn39t be a problem for you sometimes lemon or a splash of vinegar will help use sharp cheddar instead of mild cheese for a bit more tang
how could i make this less sodium content seems quit high i would use mrs dash and no salt bouillon any other suggestions i still want to keep the flavour i also use hot sauce
i want this soup everyday
we had a snowstorm in michigan today this comfort food really hit the spot and has great flavor my husband and son didn39t know they were eating cauliflower i will definitely be making this again thank you
i made this and a hit add a loaf of semolina bread and an awesome meal
i make this all the time it is delicious you can substituteadd broccoli brussel sprouts asparagus cabbage i always add a bit of finely minced red bell pepper with the veggies and i brown garlic and onions with the butteroil it takes it to another level i also fry bacon or add chunks of ham to the soup so good
wow this soup was wonderful so easy to put together and good flavour the only things i did differently were to put a ¼ tsp of crushed red pepper flakes in instead of the hot sauce and i chopped the vegetables fine with my hand blender after they were cooked and then added the milk mixture this recipe went into my file
made it as stated it was amazing my husband said please make that again
loved this soup i roasted the cauliflower in olive oil with a shallot and a sweet green pepper for about 15 minute also used a very small amount of slab bacon sauteed with the cut up stems and leaves of the cauliflower after roasting i put the veggies in the pot with the broth
absolutely delicious and so easy to make this is a home run
the easy recipe combined satisfying vegetable flavors in a light cheesy base i measured my ingredients using 5 34 cups cauliflower including some sliced stem pieces 34 cup carrot 12 cup celery 1 stalk and 2 chicken cubes watch the cooking time for veggies to avoid mushy texture i cooked mine 10minutes and thought cauliflower was a bit too soft have cheese sauce ingredients measured and ready once the pot of vegges are truned on this goes together quickly i l enjoyed this soup because the recipe only used one cup of cheese the calories were lower and it avoided a thick gluelike soup serves 4 as a main dish they will want more
great recipe easy and quick and result is homely and delicious
yummy and a success with the family used 1 milk and added some lentils to thicken increased pepper as had no chilli oil added crushed coriander seeds cos i like them left out flour and would leave out butter next time gave each bowl a tiny bit of vintage cheddar so reduced fat used vegetarian oxo used this recipe to use up left over cooked cauliflower from sunday lunch really lovely will make again x
i made this exactly as written except i subbed herb
very good soup i added 14 tsp nutmeg because that39s what i doto cauliflower soup i also used store brand extra sharp cheddar cheese told once to always use extra sharp cheddar to get more taste for the buck
made this soup and ate almost all of it myself because it taste fantastic
i followed directions it tastes very bland very disappointed
loved this soup easy to make will keep as a favorite soup recipe
outstanding a new family favorite i did several things differently by accident i added 2 tablespoons of chicken seasoning better than bullion instead of 2 teaspoons knowing that would be salty i didn39t add any extra salt i added 4 tablespoons butter and flour instead of 3 and still only used the 2 cups of mile added a bit extra cheese and cooked it for about 10 minutes loved it not bland at all
love this soup i just added a bit of shredded onion and coarsely mashed the cauliflower thank you
i added more celery and cheese also added onions coarsely mashed excellent
the recipe was blend so i ate dried herbs more salt onion and garlic powder after doing that it was amazing
omg just made this soup for the first time tonight and it is delicious super easy and fast too and given low fat milk a little butter and cheese pretty healthy this will be a new staple
i like this recipe i followed the recipe as stated except i added 2 12 cups of vegetable broth instead of bouillon and 2 12 cups of water the broth was pretty thin so i added 4 additional tablespoons of flower mixed it with the broth and added back into the soup that thickened it up the taste was a little bland but still good next time i may add green chillies will make again
i love this recipe however to make it gluten free i do not add the milk butter or flour instead i just leave a couple of large pieces of cauliflower then when it is done i remove the large pieces and put them in the blender then add it back to the soup voila cream soup without the gluten i do add some salt and garlic as well i think it is delicious
this is delicious soup my husband n i prefer cauliflower over broccoli i tweeked the rue slightly based on other comments of the soup being watery n it turned out perfect next time i make it my husband wants bacon added
relatively easy to make and very good it39s not a heavy cream soup flavor gets better a day or two after it39s made
so delicious on a winter day i added broccoli and corn thank you debbie for sharing this recipe
i have made this recipe twice my broth was not thin at all i took a couple of couple of cups and pureed then made sure the roux was thick when i added it to the broth my soup is really really creamy and i followed the recipe exactlythe first time the second batch i added a can of chopped green chilies just because i like them oh and i didn39t add the carrots because i don39t like carrots this recipe is one i will fix frequently i even tricked my husband into thinking it was baked potato soup he loved it
followed recipe to a tee broth was very very thin i used the chicken broth to boil veggies might add some corn now when i added broth
yumo i added 13 cup frozen corn 45 oz copped green chillies and 8oz chopped cherrywood ham very versatile recipe
made this last night very easy made it substituting 2 12 cups of low sodium chicken broth for the water and bouillon and served it with hot pepper sauce on side a great basic recipe but definitely needed the hot pepper sauce as it was bland will make again but definitely with adjustments to up seasoning thanks debbie
great soup i did exactly as the recipe stated it was delicious the next time i make it i will add some chopped roasted green chilies in it ima green chilei nut
omg made this yesterday and only different i did was add some leftover ham in the begining and it was the very best cauliflower soup i ever had soooooo easy to make little time and the taste is unbelievable going to make it again next week
so easy and good i substituted broccoli for cauliflower and it was wonderful
this soup was amazing i added a garlic clove and a potato also increased all ingredients to feed all i think original amounts were not enough i will definitely make this again everyone loved it
yum made it not changing anything
this soup was easy and delicious have to double or triple since my husband couldn39t get enough
i made a half recipe for taste testing and thought it was very good i will make it again but the half recipe only yielded 2 12 cups of soup i did not see where anyone else questioned the quantity i track all the nutritional data in recipes and this makes it difficult to accept the portions and calorie count shown for the recipe i doublechecked the amount of the ingredients and found i was accurate with that anyone else find it does not make the quantity stated
omg i made this i did add mushrooms instead of carrots and i did add smoked paprika but amazing i39m a vegetarian so this was perfect i used vegetable broth not water also i am in love with this and will pass it along yummy
very underwhelmed with all the fabulous reviews i was hoping for so much more followed recipe exactly but have hot helped a little but i doubt enough to make me want to make again
pretty good i doubled it and added chopped onion because a soup without onion seemed weird and extra cheese i also added some freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses lawry39s garlic salt and tony chachere39s creole seasoning instead of the hot sauce i omitted the salt and pepper from the roux and added to taste after i combined the cheese sauce to the vegetables i would39ve gave it 25 to a 3 without my tweaks i will use this recipe again for broccoli cheese soup
i found this soup so bland and runny i even used pepper jack instead of cheddar i don39t understand what all the raves were about not yummy just boring
i make this often i sometimes use broccoli it39s yummy too
i made this with almond milk
senstrings read test kitchen tips below directions it gives you gluten free suggestions
i am just questioning how this soup can be considered gluten free when it uses allpupose flour it comes up in the results when i search for gf
this soup is easy and delicious 5 stars
great soup very easy made a couple changes for personal preference used coconut milk and skipped the cheese used half veggie broth plus the bullion it was fabulous
i stumbled upon this recipe and made it because i needed to cook a cauliflower this soup is absolutely delicious so easy to make and all of the ingredients are staples in my pantry i will be making this again and again
i made this and really enjoyed it i had to sub out a few things though if you are unlucky like me and did not have any type of broth on hand you can use a couple cups of water with a couple tbsp of melted butter added to mimic the fats in broth then i added a few seasonings to the mixture to taste cardamom turmeric nutmeg white pepper and a dash of salt i also begun with some chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic just preference i also did not have carrots but used frozen butternut squash in its place next time if i have more time i will roast my vegetables
i was a bit disappointed because of the outstanding reviews the ingredients anything special and that is what i got my changes were that i precooked the cauliflower by roasting it before adding it to the broth after the other vegetables were cooked i also used the smokey hot sauce for more flavor i will be the leftovers as i serve it
very quick and simple to make delicious
i made this soup the other night for supper amp it was a big hit quick amp easy to make amp full of flavor will make it very often didn39t change a thing
easy and super delicious even without a carrotsaving it
absolutely delicious and very simple to make i used almond milk and chickpea flour this recipe is a keeper thanks for sharing
couldn39t wait to try this recipe just by seeing the picturei made it and it was a home run and i fell in love have made this soup half a dozen times since and plan on making it tonight for family visiting from colorado thanks for sharing it with us
a friend of mine made this for new years it was excellent kept thinking about it so today39s the day i39m making it
i loved this soup and so easy to make will be making this again soon
easy tasty and low calorie i tried it with almond milk instead of milk and there wasn39t much difference in taste it was still very good
best soup i have ever made
i wouldn39t bother with this recipe again very little flavor except cauliflower instructions are iffy at best 212 cups of water to cover the veggies really my boyfriend amp i ate it but i threw the rest of it out as well as the recipe itself
i love cauliflower soup as the weather gets cooler it39s so comforting and filling i adjusted this recipe to make it a lot lighter in calories and fat and it tastes incredible before boiling the vegetables in stock to make the soup i roasted the cauliflower onions and garlic first it adds a lovely depth of flavor
i love cauliflower soup as the weather gets cooler it39s so comforting and filling i adjusted this recipe to make it a lot lighter in calories and fat and it tastes incredible before boiling the vegetables in stock to make the soup i roasted the cauliflower onions and garlic first it adds a lovely depth of flavor
very good it39s a traditional cauliflower soup i did use the hot sauce and i think without it it would be bland
great soup recipe
delicious soup i made it just as the recipe instructs i had no hot sauce i did have some pepper jack cheese so i added two slices of it i like the fact that this soup is good for me tasty and not high in calories
fabulous soup so easy to make i substituted the chicken bouillon cube for a 32 oz carton of vegetable broth perfect choice i also cut up more carrots and celery as we love veggies this is the third time making this soup and it is a keeper very tasty
great soup made this as a low carb soup used unsweetened almond milk took out a cup of veggies and creamed the rest then added the cup of veggies back in very good got 10 serving with only 5 carbs per serving
this cauliflower soup is easy to make it is delicious light filling and for this family a 34keeper34 recipe
everyone loved this soup
my family loves cauliflower and this soup is a real treat on cold winter days they can39t seem to get enough of it
i love cauliflower soup and this will definitely be in my rotation the second time i made it the only cheese i had on hand was a decent pepper jack so that39s what i used and it was even better
subbed chicken broth for bullion because that39s all i had on hand soup was delicious even my very picky 5 year old ate it
very good soup takes longer than 30 minutes unless you already have the vegetables prepared i used one 14 oz can of reducedsodium chicken broth vs bouillon and ended up including 1 34 cups water with the broth with only the broth plus 34 cup water there wasn39t enough liquid for the vegetables to cook in i added 1 tsp dried parsley 14 tsp onion powder and 18 tsp garlic powder but did not include the hot sauce the head of cauliflower was about 1 12 lb and about 6 cups of florets the finished soup was just a little over 8 cups served with corn muffins yummy
i39m giving this 5stars for taste in my own recipe book it39s a 4star recipe because i reserve 5 stars for recipes that i would serve to company and it39s not quite fancy enough for that but when it39s a cold and rainy night and you39re home alone with your husband staying in and you have a loaf of french bread that needs to be eaten this is the perfect meal i just used a spicy salt and pepper blend instead of hot sauce we loved it
so easy to make and everyone loved it
excellent and easy to make
this was wonderful and easy to make i added an onion and used sharp cheddar will make a little thicker next time as well
i changed it up a little added a jalapeno substituted a half teaspoon xanthium gum for the flour and unflavored almond milk for the milk sooo good
very easy to make and filling used sharp cheese and turned out delicious
amazing soup all 4 kids loved it also followed recipe exact used sharp cheese and thickened it a little at the end will make again
loved this soup i am not a soup lover but on a hunch tried this recipe and discovered a new fav simple to make and very tasty and filling simply delicious
loved it i don39t normally like cheese in my soup but the cheese compliments this soup perfectly and i loved the addition of the celery i added two small onions next time i will saute the vegetables in the butter first then make the roux i used 4 t butter and flour and only 2 cups bouillon lowsodium
made this soup and it is delicious
i made this and it is delicious i didn39t have cheddar but i had marble which is close enough i also added onion to celery and carrots while cooking will make this recipe again
i made this soup and thought it was delicious added broccoli for a bit more color will save this recipe to enjoy again
just made this with pepper jack cheese and it was awesome will be making this again
just made this soup for dinner amp absolutely loved it forgot to pick up some shredded cheddar cheese so used velveeta amp it was delicious will be making it againsoon
this was excellent i used broccoli instead of cauliflower and used evaporated milk added onion parsley and basil i did mash the broccoli so it wasn39t big chunks not mashing it to bits but just to break up some will be making this again wonderful for those that said it was too thin i didn39t think so at all
i did think the soup was a little on the bland side so i added some onion powder that that seemed to help i also added a bit more flour because i like a thicker soup and i thought this was on the thin side i do have to say it was very easy to make
my favorite soup i exchange chicken broth for water add an onion and an extra cup of cheese to give a little more pizazz that my family loves
without a doubt one of the best soups i39ve made i followed the directions and added a little extra cheese came out very good and didn39t last long either
i first made this a week ago without bouillon which i didn39t have i chose this recipe after reading several others because of the nutritional values then i read a review about substituting chicken broth for the bouillon and water i have type 2 diabetes sooolow sodium chicken broth low fat cheddar and milk and it39s a solid 5 star from ingredients that are usually in my kitchen thanks for posting debbieadded after trying this a few times great base with almost endless possibilities i39ve also done this as potato soup and chicken soup and still experimenting
really tasty used celery salt instead of fresh celery reduced reg salt some to accommodate added some onion powder garlic powder and 4 oz velveeta
i made this soup per the recipe and did add some minced garlic and half an onion next time i would add two more carrots the soup is great it is a keeper
very easy recipe and quite delicious i did dice 12 of a small onion and omitted the cheese and the soup was still delicious thank you
really good
very skeptical of veggie soups but wow very delicious and full of flavor i just diced the carrots and added a 14 cup diced onions too will be making again
excellent soup i highly recommend trying it
easy recipe with most ingredients already in the kitchen very good kids loved it my toddler included suggest pairing it with salad and home made bread sticks for a meal or a sandwich yum also one more suggestion the recipe says to put it in a bowl but i39d put it in a pan and bring it to a boil
i used ham pieces in broth that i simmered from leftover baked ham bone instead of a chicken base because i had it on hand we like cauliflower and ham so i thought it would be good it was
since there are only 2 of us i made a 12 batch using about 35 cups of cauliflower it made about 3 large dinner size bowls of soup excellent my husband really liked it instead of hot sauce i sprinkled on a turmeric spice mixture yum just the right amount of spice
this soup is excellent i did however use nosodium chicken bouillon since we are watching sodium intake it was great next time i may use broccoli
very good basic recipe i added some broccoli and a handful of green peas for color add or subtract it39s all good
does anyone proofread these recipes direction 1 says to put ing in a bowl then bring to a boil
good stuff even people who are afraid to eat cauliflower will like this if they have guts
quick easy and good
easy and yummy my son and i really liked it but it didn39t win over my husband who doesn39t care for cauliflower most of the time
quick an easy omitted chile peppersdont like the hotheat it would bring left out the celery used half an half mixed whalf cup water instead of whole milk used monterey cheese instead of cheddar creamy an yummy not a drop left after serving
outstanding look no further this is the only cauliflower soup recipe you will ever need
omgosh just made this recipe for the first time and it is to die for i did as some other reviewers stated by adding in some onion garlic and red pepper i didn39t have any celery so instead used some dry celery flakes i subbed 2 cups of almond milk for the 2 for those of us who are lactose intolerant and added in some hot pepper flakes this is a keeper for sure and will be trying it with broccoli next time i think some bacon bits would be good in it as well thanks for a wonderful recipe
not a fan too salty and the gravy overpowered the taste of the veggies i wish i had found another cauliflower recipe
this will be my staple absolutely delicious i live cauliflower soup this is my favorite
loved this so did my family i didn39t have any carrots so i grated parsnips also i added fresh grated and chopped ginger
i don39t have vegetable bullion how much vegetable broth should i use
this is likely one of the easiest tastiest soupdefinitely on my to make list again i was surprised that it tasted as good as it did at first taste and didn39t need to sit to gel the flavours
this was probably the best soup that i39ve ever made i followed the recipe and added the hot sauce i used an emulsion blender on the cooked vegetables before adding the cheese sauce i also added a few croutons and fresh cracked pepper to each bowlabsolutely delicious
i have made this soup twice now love the flavours i do find that it is a bit thin for a creamy soup i tried pureeing some of the cauliflower and adding it back in but i think next time i make it i will try reducing the amount of water used to cook the vegetables overall a yummy soup recipe
i made this soup last week for the first time because i had leftover cauliflower that i needed to use up it was so quick amp easy to make so i wasn39t expecting the taste to be so great it was really good though this will now be my goto cauliflower soup
delicious soup i added 1 medium onion diced i also sauted the onion celery carrots and cauliflower in 1 tbsp butter for a few minutes before adding water and bouillon
fantastic soup didn39t use hot pepper but did add minced garlic and onion instead of bouillon cube just added chicken broth will definitely make again and again
i am a huge soup lover and this was really tasty i didn39t use celery or hot pepper sauce but i added in garlic powder and chopped onions definitely will be making this again
this is a great soup a family favorite
i tried this recipe tonight and it is delicious i didn39t have celery didn39t use the hot pepper sauce but added some cayenne pepper because i like that better and used 4 cheese mexican style cheese because that39s what i had on hand i used canned carrots collective gaspthis will definitely be making repeat appearances in my house my nephew even commented on how good it was thanks for sharing this one
i tried this recipe for the first time today have to say that there seemed to be toolittle seasoning involved so i used my go to combo of onion powder white pepper and sea salt i literally use these seasonings in every savory dish also added parsley and basil flakes i didn39t have shredded cheddar so i used six cheese italian shredded cheese that i did have this soup will move into my personal line up the hubby is the soup king here but this one is mine we both loved it
this soup was awesome i left out the celery had none in the house and added chicken to get more protein very easy and quick for lunch also this will be made again
my nephew thought he did not like cauliflowerand then he had this soup its a winner in his book
this soup was amazing i did use low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and bullion this was so good served w some great sea salt and garlic pita crackers
loved it quick easy to make on a hectic holiday night my husband who is not a fan of cauliflower even had seconds made it per recipe no substitutions did not have hot sauce on hand but will try splash in it next time may try it with some smoked sausage next time too for a heartier meal
very hearty chunky soup i made it as stated but used a cup of veggie stock and added a half onion it came out very thick had to add a little extra milk it39s a great and easy recipe but as others have said bland i added extra salt but still kind of lacked something and i didn39t want to be pouring the salt in still great and i can39t wait to make again with some herbs and with broccoli too thanks
delicious easy and very filling
loved the taste leftovers went into freezer i39m anxious to thaw and try again
excellent soup my family loves it alsomy sister tried it and also loves it and now makes it for her family toothanks taste of home
delicious added some onion and garlic powder because i really like onion and garlic would have been great without
i made this and it was amazing i added alittle left over chicken i did double batch glad i did yum
i made a half batch of this last night and it was great i love a quick recipe that is still fromscratch
i made this soup yesterday and it is wonderful i had my daughter and her family try it as well everyone loved it i didn39t have any bouillon cubes so i used equal amount of vegetable broth and no water i also took someone39s advice and pureed just a little of the cauliflower mixture to thicken the soup this is a wellbalanced tasty soup thanks for the great recipe
i39m not sure how thick the soup is supposed to be but it does seem to be thin i added red onion kale and a pinch of cayenne pepperi39m taking it to work for a lunch hope everyone that tries it likes it
good but a little bland as is i added sauteed onions and garlic with a splash of sherry and a pinch of nutmeg now excellent
i thought the flavor of this soup was very good i will make again but next time i will cut the water by 12 cup i thought soup was too thin
i had a nice sized cauli which i prepared some skim milk some heavy cream but no other veggies so instead of celery and carrots i added a can of mixed veggies used 1 cup milk and one of cream plus 34 cup kraft shredded pepper jack it was a most delish soup and i will enjoy it often this winter the pepper jack was a real winner
love the texture of this soup its rich thick and chunky most comforting i did make a few changes and exchanges i added garlic and onions i also replaced some of the water for white wine and right before serving added a pinch of nutmeg janietaste of home volunteer fe
tasty but a bit bland i think that i would add some onion to this recipe
exu can also add broccoli part way thru cooking
i love it will try it again thanks for the awesome recipy
i made this for a christmas eve family dinner it was a huge hit
this is wonderful i did think it needed a little more flavor i didn39t add the pepper sauce so i used 4 chicken bouillon cubes in the water perfect i have made this twice once with cauliflower and once with broccoli and will make it again and again
fantastic i didn39t shred my carrots and i added a few extra i got rave reviews at home
this was very good and very easy i added frozen pea39s i had on hand after tasting it and that made it even better i also thought it needed more salt and would like to try it with garlic like others have said next time i make it but over all very good my husband even liked it but he said could we add some bacon he39s a meat person
love it so rich and tasty and only 159 calories for 1 cup serving
very good i would like it a little thicker so i may mash the cauliflower some next time
good
so simple and soooo good
delicious and so easy to make
working man husband is diabetic hard to fill up on a low carb diet but add in 1 or 2 lbs of browned pork sausage to this marvelous soup recipe and he39s in heaven
fantastic soup i left my cauliflower in big chunks when it was simmering then once it was soft before i added the bchamel sauce i gently used a potato masher this ensured all the cauliflower chunks were in bite size pieces
it was very easy to make and tasted great i will make it again soon i also made it substituting broccoli
awesome soupi added about half a bag of baby carrots a jalapeno pepper one sweet bell pepper one onion 3 stalks of celery one carton of turkey broth 5 cups of water garlic clove salt amp pepper cooked until tender ran veggies thru vitamix and with the broth mixture i added 3t of flour and 2cups milk to make my rue added the 1 cup of cheddar cheese stirred and added my pureed veggies wow oh wowthis soup rocks very filling and healthy according to my calorie count each cup is about 55 calorieseat more soup
hubby and i love this soup next time we will add cooked bacon to it to give it also a meaty flavor and my hubby generally does not like soup
i highly recommend making this soup i added minced garlic to it
made the original recipe except swapped 18 tsp hot pepper flakes for sauce not sure how the soup got rated at 8 1 cup servings when there39s only 4 12 cups liquid in the recipe irregardless the soup was delicious and it39s on my 34keeper34 list
this was excellent i thought it would be bland but it was full of flavor and my guest raved about it i used frozen cauliflower almond oil and basil olive oil because that is all i had on hand i pureed the vegetables and served it as an entree there was enough for four people not eight but we were all satisfied everyone asked for the recipe
this is very simple and tasty you wouldn39t know it39s a healthy soup by the indulgent taste i made it with milk and it39s still delicious
so good rich and flavorful easy to make
fabulous recipe great use of cauliflower tasty and hearty soup i used a little less butter more cauliflower and carrots than called for i also used a can of condensed milk instead of fresh and hit it with the immersion blender i will definitely make again
very flavorful i doubled the celery used low sodium chicken base added extra 12 cup water and omitted salt i39ve never had cauliflower soup but this will go in my collection of soup favorites
i just made this soup and just like moxier i tripled the celery and carrots and added 12 onion and some button mushrooms it turned out awesomeits a great rue and soup starter for all cheesy milky soups good recipe
during yesterday39s snowstorm i made this rich and creamy soup i use milk and had to use a little extra as the soup was too thick i also pureed the vegetables before adding the milk and cheese mixture serve with salad and fresh bread my husband lived it good thing i doubled the recipe
absolutely wonderful and healthy i used my 34basket34 from coop we picked up yesterday i changed by using 3 x more celery and carrots and half low salt chicken stock i had on hand to thicken i used king arthur instant clear jel rather than flour and dropped the butter in pot the pepper flakes enhanced the flavorsthank you debbie
i don39t normally post reviews but wow i did take what i thought was the best advice from the other reviewers but must give 5 stars for the original recipe for getting me started i doubled the carrots and celery and used 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth i also gave the cauliflower mixture a few shots with the immersion blender after doing so i added about 8 oz of chopped cooked ham i used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce i also cut down on the salt probably a bit less than 12 tsp the final result was incredible kudos to the op
amazing perfect comfort food and finally a soup without onion and garlic i am currently 6 months pregnant and have had an aversion to onions and garlic my entire pregnancytrying to find canned soup or a homemade soup recipe without these ingredients is like searching for the holy grail i made a couple of modificationsi used my immersion blender to puree some of the soup to make it thicker and add a silkier texture i also used crushed red pepper flakes to add some spice because franks hot sauce contains garlic powder
fantastic recipe my family loved it
this soup is excellent everyone loved it i also added some chopped onion because i had some handy from making another soup
very very good i added chopped onions next time i will make a little thicker will add more flour flavor is awesome
this was absolutely delicious the only changes i made were to use 1 milk because that39s all i had in the house and to add a little chopped ham we had leftover from christmas thick creamy and so quick the whole thing took 30 minutes from prep to bowl this is a keeper
making this again tonight i have a head of fresh cauliflower ready and waiting and a few carrots i swap the celery for a white onion add a bit of cream to the milk and hit it with the immersion blender a few times to make it almostsmooth add a grilled cheese sandwich and a little salad and i am one happy happy girl
we loved this soupserved it to a friend and he thought it was excellent turned out he hated cauliflower and hadn39t eaten any since he was a kid this soup changed his mind
this is sooo good and it39s wonderful for the cold nights when you are tired and you are also vegetarian i add a corn muffin and voila
this was really good i added ground sausage and some onion will definitely be making again
it tastes really good you must like the combinations
diced a small onion and sweated it along with carrots diced and celery in 1 tbsp margerine for about 5 minutesfollowed remainder of recipe and turned out absolutely delicious
what happened to the bacon lol
i have made this at least once a week for the last month i will tell you how i changed it just a bit and it is amazing i always use low sodium chicken broth i add some broccoli and zucchini and at the end i always pure at least 2 to 3 cups and it is simply the best soup i also double the recipe because in my household it disappears quickly oh and i always use reduced fat mexican mixed cheese like sargento bon appetite
awesome i used velveeta cheese cause that39s what i had hubby advised make it again enough for 2 amp enough left to reheat again can increase carrot or celery but use extra bouillon amp water if you do
excellent i knew with so many good reviews it had to be good amp wow made as written without ingredient changes but pured about 112 cups mixture amp mixed back in to add texture as another reviewer noted will definitely make again easy amp wonderful
wonderful recipe i like a chunkier soup so i doubled the veggies and steamed instead of boiled them and then added them when i combined the cheese sauce to the water i also blended about 12 a head of cauliflower to make a creamier base had it with a side of soft boiled eggs for some protein and it was a wonderful dinner
wonderful recipe so delicious i added garlic onion and brussel sprouts to add some green to the soup next time i will also add chicken this was an easy recipe and perfect for fal season
thank you i am a newly diagnosed diabetic finally i found something i like with low carbs i made it with almond milk bc my doctor wants me to switch from 34real milk34 to this stuff and it was still really good i am actually eating it right now for breakfast
omg what a delicious soup only made 2 adjustments used sodiumfree chicken stock instead of water and bouillon also used a combo of american amp asiago cheese a little more than a cup next time gonna use broccoli
this was a really good soup its hard not to double the recipe i omitted the red pepper sauce
the best soup i39ve ever made it thicken up after it set awhile so next time i39ll add more milk or water i added 2 cloves of garlic chopped and 12 tsp tumeric which i put in everything since it39s so good for you and chopped up 12 red pepper to add a little color i love this soup
delicious i prefer to use 2c chicken stock with half a cup of water to eliminate the msg from the bouillon
i made this on a sunday morning for lunch later on it smelled so good my 12 yr old son had some for breakfast its a huge hit and i love how he is getting several servings of vegies and calcium the only thing i changed was i pureed about a cup of the cauliflower mixture before i added the milk cheese mixture it was awesome plus i love the fact that the recipe came from chilliwack my relatives all come from bc and i have spent many beautiful cool fall nights at cultus lake this soup is perfect for fall thanks debbie
great soup it was very thick and although i didn39t mind it others commented so i added some more milk to thin it out
excellent soup everyone in the family loved the soup even my 3 year old who hates eating her vegetables i added quite a bit more of each of the vegetables and doubled the rest of the recipe definitely worth a try
great super easy and quick i added additional chopped celery and carrots along with the chicken bouillon i used some boxed chicken broth in place of some of the water in equal amounts i increased all the ingredients to compensate for the added vegetables yum
easy amp delicious i39ve made it with cauliflower as the main ingredient and also combined cauliflower with broccoli very good each time goes great with any sort of sandwich
this was very good soup i used all boxed chicken broth in place of the water amp no chicken bouillon cube i added 12 diced onion broccoli chopped pieces 2 diced yukon gold potatoes amp 2 garlic cloves i also used half amp half in place of the milk i was trying to copy a restaurant39s recipe this was very close amp the soup went quickly
very simple and quick to make i omit the salt and use 12 mild cheddar and 12 sharp cheddar cheese so tasty
i have made this soup several times we love it i have also substituted broccoli for the cauliflower we belong to a coop and sometimes we get cauliflowersometimes broccoli both are yummy in this soup
i love this soup it is so quick and easy and is always a hit i serve it whenever i have to whip up something healthy in a hurry have added corn on occasion as well yum i usually do biscuits or scones to go with this soup and rarely is there leftovers i39ve added this recipe to my huge list of favourite soups
loved this easy to make i left out the hot sauce maybe next time i will try it with it but i really liked it with out so not sure
my goal this winter is to try one new soup recipe each week this one was very easy tasty and healthy this soup is low enough in carbs to be very good for anyone who is diabetic or counting carbs this is a quick meal while the vegetables are cooking i made the white sauce i used a vegetable base rather than bouillon to cut out the msg found in most bouillons i used 12 tsp of hot sauce if you like a little spicier taste add the entire teaspoon definitely a keeper of a recipe
easy to make creamy amp oh so good the only thing i added was a bit of onion great on a cold winter day
made this for dinner tonight it was awesome i added the hot sauce while cooking and a couple of dashes to my bowl the recipe worked perfectly is was quick and easy this is a keeper
so it i decide to use chicken broth instead i don39t use any water right
made this tonight and it was a big hit the whole family gave it 5 stars my daughter said this recipe is a keeper
this soup is really good had to thicken it just a bit but it may have been that i added too much water i chose not to use the hot sauce and it was great on this very cold night this is a keeper
great soup used chicken stock and some vegetable stock instead of water also used half and half for the milk with flour makes thicker thanks for recipe
what can you substitute for the bouillon cubes too much sodium for me could i use chicken or vegetable broth this sounds so good
this is really good i usually make a potato soup similar but my husband has type 2 diabetes this is a great alternative actually i think we like it better i wouldn39t change a thing i serve it with crispy bacon and cheese on top
comfort food without guilt i made one substitution no cheddar cheese in the fridge so i used asiago cheese wow a little more upscale taste nuance probably a better cheese to use when serving this soup to adult guests than for the children maybe i can image adding maybe a dash of nutmeg to this recipe
very pleased with this soup i did 34doctor34 it up a bit added more cheese dried onion and some poultry seasoning will be making this again
my son39s favorite soup try with an orange cauliflower from farmers market it39s outstanding
this was awesome followed recipe to almost exactly except added more flour at the end mixed with 12 cup milk to thicken a bit more my husband who has never eaten cauliflower thought it was great as well thanks for a great fast recipe
i was really impressed with this recipe it is very flavorful i followed the recipe exactly except used sriracha sauce because i did not have other hot sauce and i used 1 milk instead of 2 pleased with how it turned out and would make it again
the girls all asked for seconds great way to get the veges in the base of the soup was great we sauted all the vegetables and added onion a yellow pepper doubled the celery parsley seasoning salt the girls recommended blending half and leaving half chucky would definetly make again
this is a favorite of ours i do add a chopped onion just because we like it and if i39m in a rush i just chop the carrot
easy to make very filling and very good
i used fat free chicken broth fat free cheddar cheese and fat free milk it was still fantastic
this is literally the best soup recipe i39ve ever made i keep making it freezing it remaking it i39m a big fan of onions so i choose to caramelize some onions in the main pan to add a little more of a flavor layer but it39s great with or without it make this soup
i39ve just recently begun to cook and even the simplest things seem overwhelming for me this soup however was as simple as can be and turned out to be delicious i made it for my family and got some compliments even the fouryearold ate it
it was wonderful
my husband is not a fan of cauliflower but this recipe got a thumbs up from him for a little added protein i am going to add chicken he wants a touch of cayenne i plan to do both loved this soup
both my husband and i loved this recipe i did add smoked paprika and a little more chicken broth also i used goats milk and part skim part skim mozzarella cheese as thats what i had on hand
made this recipe for the first time tonight turned out great i did use chicken broth instead of bullion and water and blended the veggies up before adding the cheese sauce my picky 1 and 3 year olds devoured it will be making it again
excellent
my husband and i really liked this soup i added onion and i also thickened it with extra flourwater mixture at the end of cooking i didn39t measure my cheese but i39m sure i went a little heavy on that too we added the hot sauce to our bowls and we liked it very much this recipe is a keeper
one of the best soups i39ve ever made i added some fresh dilldelicious even my son who is not a soup lover loved this soup
i39ve probably made this recipe a dozen times since i first found it it gets raves from everyone i39ve served it to and i find it velvety and absolutely wonderful thanks for posting debbie
i had a head of cauliflower in my frig that i needed to use up so i decided to look online to see if i could find a good recipe so glad i did actually had all of the ingredients for this soup and it is delicious the only complaint i had was it could have been a little thicker but that can be easily solved loved the flavor so that39s the most important thing
this soup is delicious i keep cracked black pepper on the table with this recipe
delicious quick and easy i would definitely make again
i sauteed a little bit of onions in the butter and used light cheese and skim milk omitted the salt and thought it was still great
i wanted very much to like this soup but it is just too bland for my taste even with adding more cheese and hot sauce it is bland i think it definitely needs onion along with the carrots and celery
i live where you can buy cauliflower from the farmer huge head for 2 enough for batch and a half so this is so inexpensive to make and so delicious i didn39t have any celery so i chopped up a few cabbage leaves will definately make it again
this was superb i did saute all the ingredients plus a clove of garlic first in a little olive oil before adding the brothwater made it even more flavorful
this recipe is really yummy i substituted water chestnuts for the celery and it adds a nice crunch to the soup i definitely added the hot sauce and i thought it would have tasted bland without it also nice to have a cream soup without cream rather healthy
this soup is so good it39s really quick and easy to makegreat for a busy mom i added closer to a cup and a half of cheese just to finish out the bag plus i love cheese and the flavor was really nice great soup to beat the winter blues
so goodmy family really enjoyed it served it with bread didn39t change anything from the original recipe and omitted the hot sauce
this soup is a winner wonderful and filling soup on a cold day replaced the water with swanson39s chicken broth and used half n half really satisfyingthis is a quick and delicious soup
this was delicious i made it just as the recipe said and i did put in a tiny amount of hot pepper sauce we loved it
very good comfort food
there were no leftovers everyone had seconds and it was delicious
this was wonderful i used fat free milk and fat free cheese for a healthy version and it was great the taste was great
this has become my absolute favorite soup
delish
i have made this a number of times and love it because i have only myself to feed i cook the vegetables as shown but put half of it in the freezer for another day i make half of the milk etc mixture each batch simple and satisfying
this is not a review per se but a question to those bakers that have made this bread when i eat it the first day it is made its very good however it gets terribly dry after the first cuts and then it just does not taste as flavorful as that first slice within a day or so after being made it is dry and very sad tasting does anyone else have this same thing happen i love the the easiness of this recipe and hope there are some suggestions on how i might get the moist taste you get from some of the store bought white breads
pme market doesn39t have what you call bread flower what needs to be added to flour to make it bread flower i want to try this recipe because bread is the tata of the sandwich and i love a good sandwichp
this is a great recipe my boyfriend loves home made bread so i thought i39d try this one and it turned out great i39m very happy with the end results
has anyone tried letting it finish the final rise overnight in the fridge before baking in the morning
perfect recipe for making newfoundland toutons
i waited three hours and the yeast never did 34bubble34 finally my wife came home and i was going to surprise her but i wanted to ask her from her experience why the yeast was not 34bubbling34 she said of course she never heard of that and she went ahead and took over thanks a lot yeast bubbling
i usually use my bread maker but this recipe was easy and fun and the end results were fantastic i will make this again
i just made these it39s an easy recipe and they taste awesome han the house smells amazing
made bread before so nothing was new but it was fun to have hot bread as part of our meal the family loved it and it made me realize how really easy it is just think and plan ahead and you can give real treat to the ones you love
i made this delicious but gets dry pretty fast and crumbles i will try adding an extra tbls of oil
despite my relative novice level this turned out good what made me select this recipe is the homemade bread tips that taste of home provided i enjoyed the simplicity which made the recipe more approachable my first attempt was a fail and was completely my fault because i didn39t check the expiration date on my yeast which i knew after reading the tips the second attempt was so much better and gives me hope that i can get even better results i didn39t have bread flour so i just used regular allpurpose flour my family enjoyed the bread as well
it came out much better than i thought it was a little to wet at first so i added more flour when kneading it was delicious i am no baker but this recipe gave me hope
is there anything better than homemade fresh warm bread smothered with butter definitely not this bread is so delicious and so easy sure to impress any guests and yourself
this is a great recipe i use high end garlic flavored evoo instead of canola oil to give it a garlic flavor and i use caputo italian chef39s flour 00 and the bread is super light and fluffy
i have been making the basic homemade bread and enjoying the 2 loaves if i half the recipe to make one loaf do i half all ingredients even the yeast which means i only use 118 teaspoon please advice thanks for all recipes
i just started making 34real34 bread parked the ol bread maker wanted the grandmother taste lol i made this recipe and it was great saw another recipe that sounded 34glorious34 adding honey etc it was boring to say the yeast came back to this 34original34 bread recipe and will be making this one from now on like artisan bread of which i make a lot of my question is this i love a thick hard crust sooooo if i were to open the oven say at the 34 cook time and 34spray34 cool water on the loaveswould that thicken the crust thanks for the great 34basic34 delicious bread reciperegardsdave
too bad and too sweet
this bread is great i haven39t made anything 34yeasty34 in a very long time easy and tasty several reviews stated it was salty so i decreased the salt mistake use 1 t as the recipe states and i used a lot less flour also i live in assisted living and the residents liked the bread slathered pieces in real butteryum make this bread
these instructions are not clear for a first time
i use this recipe for my jalepeno cheese bread also i love this recipe
perfect bread starter i do add ins black garlic onion flakes pepper powdered onion and garlic also used as base for raisin bread the options are endless
i like this recipe because easy to keep up with and written in a convoluted story format and the website make you click next page and next page this website is less clickbait than the other top of google bread recipes the bread comes out good if you like a hard crust and soft spongy center my girlfriend says too salty so trying it with half the recipe recommended amount of salt i thought the salt was fine but i want her to eat the bread too so less salt and i tried it with honey instead of sugar but it look like the yeast reacted to the honey the same way as sugar the yeast kind of climbed on to the honey but bubbling so i put sugar in there with the honey too i will probably try using more yeast and seeing if that makes the bread more fluffy too next time this recipe is a good baseline to go off of and probably want to make adjustments to your taste
this came out fabulous love this recipe both loaves were fluffy and the crust was perfect thank you so much
the recipe is too salty
first bread i ever baked without a machine it came out great glad i had years of the bread machine experience so that i knew what the consistency was supposed to be during the 7minute kneading
a great recipe they came out beautifully will use recipe again
i used 4 cups of bread flour and then added enough whole wheat ezekiel flour to make the dough
i don39t know where this recipe was last year i scoured the internet looking for a recipe with a 9 x 5 pan i used 4 cups of white bread flour and added in enough whole wheat flour to make the dough and got two soft perfect loaves
absolutely love this recipe thankyou so much this bread is exactly how i wanted my bread to be
this is the best bread ever made found this recipe about 3weeks ago and just made my 7th batch this morning hubby stop eating this
can someone please tell me if this can be adapted for a bread maker i live in hot and humid florida and needless to say the oven is the least used appliance i own i actually use it to store pots and pans would love to be able to make this sounds wonderful
this was my very first attempt to make bread of any kind it was easy to do and came out perfect i actually made mine in the air fryer and cooked it at 325 x 18 minutes the texture was perfect and it too dense i followed the recipe exactly except for using the air fryer oven
i love to bake so i39ve tried many different basic bread recipes all of the ones i39ve made turn out too gooey on the inside not thoroughly cooked or too hard and crunchy additionally there are so many ingredients and it takes forever to make a loaf of bread this bread is the best bread i39ve ever had in my life it is such an easy recipe with only 6 ingredients and it takes 20 minutes to whip up aside from rising baking time the flavor is wonderful and the smell of baking bread fills the house 1010 for this recipe amazing
a nice easy recipe which i always double vegan too if you don39t butter the hot crust when it comes out which i do our noble homestead goto recipe mmmm proudly served at the magic glamp with an olive oil substitution
perfect i am not in any way a professional baker i am more of a newbie and this bread is so easy to make rather than kneading on a counter i just kept the dough in the standmixer and used the dough hook turns out great thank you so much for this recipe the family loves it
this was the first homemade bread recipe i have ever tried and it was so worth it this is a very time consuming recipe but well worth the wait it39s actually a simple recipe that is easy to follow and make the resting time for the dough just takes a bit wonderful recipe tastes so good
gerri the oven may have been to high for the yeast and it died keep in warm moist area about 80 degrees you can put them in the oven on minimal heat but if you do put them on a large baking dish thats got water on it to keep the humidity up dont bake the bread until the bread has risen to the top of the pan but not over otherwise the little it will rise in the oven heat will spill too far over the pan carrie sugar is the simplest of the 39starches39 that yeast needs to form you can use honey or even corn starch sugar just allows the yeast to propagate fastest if you use honey or starch it will take longer if you use these let the yeast work on the liquid mix before adding to the flour that gives them the boost needed to really work into the flour remember not to put yeast into too hot of liquid mix or it make kill it
this is quick easy and fool proof i39ve made this recipe 4 times now and the loaves are perfect each time they freeze well too and are easy to slice great for sandwiches
i followed the directions completely and when the bread doubled in size about an hour or less in the 2 pans i took them out always warm in the oven and shaped them in the loaf pans and baked at 375 degrees and they did not puff up i also used all purpose flour
i actually have a question does the sugar in this recipe make the bread taste sweet at all my family does not like regular loaf type bread that is the least little bit sweet we do love cinnamon rolls and the such just not sandwich type bread
super easy starter recipe for any nonbakers turned out perfectly and my family gobbled it up currently making more
such a great recipe and easy for this beginner to follow you saved our christmas last year my mother was diagnosed with alzheimer39s and she39s the one that made christmas with her cooking and baking dad has been her caregiver ever since and has been cooking like a champ my husband and i live 2min away and my brother is staying with them and has been a huge help but none of us were ready for the holidays not really last year i did nothing this year we cooked what we wanted instead of trying to mimic what mom did fried catfish and shrimp anyonei also was able to make homemade bread and ham for the family a tradition that39s been in place for as long as i can remember and i39m 50 they loved it thank you 1000x and happy holidays
love this bread and easy to make my family loves it too
this bread is super easy to make made it for my family and friends and they said it was the best bread they ever had
i39m new to bread making i39ve tried two other breads before this one and this one is my favorite my family enjoys this bread and it39s very easy to make i did not use a bread pan and my loaves baked nicely it does not state whether to preheat the oven or not i preheated it i will not buy store bought bread again unless i am in a pinch great recipe
tried many white bread recipes and this is the only one i make now i make this weekly and got a lovely texture toasts up amazing nice and easy and i make croutons out of the end piece keeps brilliantly in the fridge and perfect for sandwiches
just baked my first loaves of bread this is a simple and foolproof recipe turned out delicious
new to baking this one was easy and delicious
hey tasteofhome fans i finally found a splinter free quality banneton proofing basket i used it already twice it works great and is extremely easy to clean httpsamznto333ezke enjoy your homemade bread
wonderful recipeyummy
this bread is excellent easy to follow recipe
to michele the oven temperature is
easy recipe to follow i used bread flour and weighted my flour and used rapid yeast it raised beautifully both times i also used my proof feature of my oven this recipe is a keeper thank you
i started baking bread again last june this was the first recipe i used and it is the base for every bread i39ve made since it is so easy to add ingredients or swap one thing for another each time the bread has been a success i39ve made garlic kalamata olive bread chocolate granola bread and several other variations but at its heart its always this basic recipe thanks
why is the video different from the instructions written i guess ill just follow the video
how many cups of flour is needed in this recipe it39s not indicated in the list of ingredients
i have baked homemade bread for many years this recipe yielded me the very best loaves of bread i have ever made the thing i done different this time was i used all bread flour historically i used all purpose flour while my bread always turned out well the crust was very hard and the bread was dense but i never had any leftovers this recipe and using bread flour my bread top was soft and my bread was light as it is from the grocery store i was amazed but i recommend trying this recipe and use bread flour only after it comes out of the oven brush the tops with melted butter i hope you enjoy making your bread and that it turns out perfectly as mine did thanks for providing home cooks with a great recipe
my first time to make bread at home simple recipe that turned out perfect thanks
thank you is this 375f or 375 degrees celsius
1st time i tried it thank you perfect
just a question do we have to preheat our convention oven for this if we have to how much and how long should we set it for
great basic bread recipe easy even if you are so so at following directions i left to rise a bit too long but it still turned out like the photo not too many bubbles for me on the yeast either but again turned out like the photo i baked 35 minutes the hollow sound didn39t sound hollow to me it sounded dense to me but then again i don39t know what to listen for as an amateur either way it turned out great despite some slight deviations on my part this really makes you think about wtf they are putting into store bought bread to make it that light texture talk about diluting the mixture with garbage the store bread you pay 2 or more per loaf for and is marked up and low quality it is worth way less than that and i made this quality bread for about 166 per batch 83 cents per loaf at 33 cents for yeast 250 for 5 lb bag flour divided at 3 13 cups per pound using 6 14 cups you could get even cheaper if you wanted to buy in bulk but that isn39t necessary as you only save a few cents and then you have to make a lot of bread before the yeast expires i39d experiment by putting everything seasoning on the top of it caraway seeds pumpkin seeds sunflower seed pits the list goes on the bread is hearty for refined white bread flour and crusty not soft and easy to puncture than the store crap good luck youtube lcatrn
great recipe
i was looking for an easy foolproof bread recipe that did not require a bread machine this was perfect after making it according to the recipe the first time i got brave and added shredded coconut and some coconut extract to a batch worked great next i tried it chopped toasted almonds and almond extract super good will keep using this as my foundation as i try a few more variations
it has become my go to recipe and have used this recipe several times love it thanks
one of my first times making bread and this recipe yielded two fantastic loafs i was initially worried because the rise was quicker that the recipe said first one doubled in 50 minutes and the second in 40 and the bread was much bigger than anticipated but overall it tasted really good also the recipe doesnt estimate a cook time for me it was 1 hour and 25 minutes at
followed this recipe to the t it sucked
now rating this recipe but been using this one for the last 3 months this recipe is amazing we tweaked by adding raw oats and crushed flaxseed to make it a little more healthy it came out really well this recipe for us yielded 2 nice loaves and when we toasted the slices for breakfast the flavor of the oats and flaxseed made it even more delicious it feels like we had it in a café thank you for this we buy bread anymore
it was my first time to bake bread the recipe was easy to follow had great results the bread was perfect my family loved it
i really enjoy this recipe it39s my goto my only question is regarding the nutritional content it says 1 slice can you give the weight of one slice 1 slice can vary in size thank you
it doesn39t say when to add the 2 12 cups of water
i made this yesterday and had some today for breakfast first time making bread and it was awesome my wife really enjoyed it too and said freeze the 2nd loaf because it last
this was my first ever attempt at baking bread the recipe was easy to follow and i had fun baking great first time exoerience i mixed my flour with some wheat four and the bread came out perfectly
hi can i omit the sugar in the recipe we don39t like the bread to be sweet
i am by no means a baker last time i made bread was 5 yrs ago i know this because my mom passed in 2015 this recipe is easy and tastes wonderful tip since yeast is the new toilet paper during this virus find a local bake shop and ask them is you can buy some yeast i found fresh and it had expired and worked beautifully just proof it like active dry yeast cheer and good luck
this recipe really surprised me it was so easy and the results are amazing far beyond my expectations it tasted like fresh delicious store bought soft warm italian breadthis is going to be a new favorite recipe of mine for sure my husband loved it incredibly delicious the proofing takes some time but all the steps were very easy to follow thank you so much i love it
i made bread for the first time using this recipe and it was amazing i used half the sugar but it still was great this recipe is a keeper
thank you for the recipe this was my first time baking bread and came out really good
just finished baking this bread easy recipe and great results have baked other bread and much more difficult recipes in the past and had as much success as with this one
like to convert this recipe for a bread machine and not savvy about how to do that can you help me in doing so will you test it and advise me of the end result thank you cynthia
this recipe is absolutely amazing the bread comes out super brown and my house literally smells like a bakery so glad i discovered this recipe before quarantine to those that are struggling try again and in my opinion do everything in one bowl
i have never so much as attempted to make something from scratch before i made this tonight following the recipe and instructions as closely as i could and it came out fantastic i am so pleased
i followed the recipe to the letter but for some reason my bread came out like a lump of coal i strongly recommend lowering the temperatures trying to get my bread to 200 degrees celsius internally took a lot of effort
yeast seems to be in short supply right now so i found this recipe while searching for a recipe that used only one packet of yeast i made no changes to the recipe and ended up with two beautiful and tasty loaves of bread i found the video to be very helpful also my usual recipe calls for two packets of yeast this bread takes longer to make but is just as good i let it rise in the bowl for raw full two hours and for 15 hrs in the pans
questionhelp anyone plsi dissolve the yeast and sugarhow long before i see bubbles on the surface 34first time trying bread 34
just made this and it turned out great considering i didnt have all the correct ingredients i halved the quantities as i only wanted one loaf and used half self raising flour and half 00 pasta flour as that was all i had and im pretty sure my yeast was dead as it was out of date and didn39t bubble but it worked only ever made soda bread before so this was a great result for me as a first time bread baker
there are much better white bread recipes out there recipes that use milk rather than water make a much better bread that is easier to slice and use for sandwiches disappointing
all the temperatures i think are in fahrenheit otherwise i think this recipe doesn39t make sense
what started as a joke between my mom and my cousins turned into an amazing joke i made the bread today and it was delicious easy to follow and amazing taste definitely a keeper
fantastic recipe it was really easy i mixed by hand i substituted in about 1 cup of semolina flour since i am running low on strong flour due to the flour 34shortage34 it was fine texture and flavour were excellentl my kids loved it and one loaf was gone within 30 minutes
believe for a simple recipe how great this bread tastes i do use a mixer and dough hook and it turns out fine the only time i buy bread now is if lazy and looking for a way out so far i boughten any one loaf i freeze for the following week so only every two weeks i need to bake highly recommend this recipe both for the beginner and seasoned pro
i absolutely love this recipe i made this bread last night and family was shocked today because it was so good they never knew i could bake bread actually i never knew i could bake bread it39s awesome we are making more today so that both my daughters can learn how to do it
i love this video and all this really good bread making advice i am very ready to make my own bread at home
this is the only bread recipe that always works i followed the instructions exactly using bread flour combinations of white flour and whole wheat flour as well as millet or lentil flour along with white flour and it has always risen beautifully i have been baking bread every 4 days and get 2 perfect loaves every time thank you for this great recipe
this message is for suzanne i39ve made the bread with a standup mixer and by hand both times the bread turned out fine it was just a little easier with my kitchen aid
first time making it and it turned out great my family loves it
mine was a total disaster raw in the middle and so dense i cut the crust thinly off and they were yum i think the recipe is confusing as i read it 2 14 cups of water and 3 cups flour then it asked me to add mix till smooth well it was dough at that point couldnt add in any more flour
this recipe is great i have never made bread before aside from quick breads like banana and zucchini its was easy and tastes amazing suzanne i don39t see any reason the old fashioned way wouldn39t work it will just be a bit more effort on your part when it comes to the incorporating
delicious but part of one loaf was kind of doughy could be my oven new and we have yet to figure it out
donna two and onequarter 225 cups of water does that answer your question
we love this basic bread it turned out perfectly and taste wonderful it39s a keeper
donna i believe it is 2cups 14cups water or 94 cups
i have made this bread a couple times and love it i only had rapid rise yeast so i only had to let it rise once i just put all the ingredients in a stand up mixer bowl together and mix and then add my bread attachment and finish adding the flower after you mix it and if you use rapid yeast let it rest for 10 minutes then cut in half put in the pan and let rise and turn the oven on and bake them best bread recipe ever
fantastic bread recipe it takes our family about three days to go through a loaf of bread so i refrigerated half the dough after kneading it the first time it continues to rise in the fridge so make sure you put it in a container with room for it to double and a tight fitting lid took it out today punched it down shaped for the second loaf and continued the recipe from there it turned out perfectly
question it says 214 does that mean 214 cups of water or 2 14 cups of water which 12 cup
hi i love making bread i used to make it the standard way i found an old fleishman booklet that had two ways to make it i like the sponge method but still my bread 2nd day is crumbly and heavy any suggestions
sounds delicious wait to try but have a question unfortunately i do not have a standing mixer with a dough hook so is it possible to make this recipe the fashioned way or should i not attempt it
this was my 1st time making homemade bread complete success it came out perfect
loved it and it was easy
this recipe is amazing i am a complete newbie when it comes to bread i can make pizza dough like a pro but bread has always intimidated me using bread flour in my recipe was my first priority second was no milk or egg this recipe was easy to follow and ended up with a bread better than the bakery my picky eater39s words i used a dough hook on my mixer and after was pulled together i hand kneaded it for about 4 minutes longer the most perfect bread ever don39t be intimidated just follow written directions fully only thing i would add is to put the rack toward the bottom so the 34poof34 of the bread is in the middle of the oven when it39s risen and browning thank you again
i never succeeded at making bread until i used this recipe i highly suggest you follow the link on how to proof your bread what a difference it made i never watched the video i simply followed the written directions
so this is a great recipe for ingredients but terrible directions and video i used the recipe as stated except i need quite as much flour but followed mixing kneading rising and shaping instructions from youtuber with seriously do yourself a favor and watch his yeasted bread tutorial then make this following his directions you regret it made bread before but never turned out as good as after i used his instructions with this recipe the combo will reward you with amazing delicious bread every time happy baking
this is really good bread but i agree not every home kitchen has a stand mixer last year i bought a hamilton beach auto bread maker for around 40 at walmart even has a gluten free setting either bake the loaf in the machine or pull the dough out to shape proof and bake as you wish why or why i do this sooner even a moron baker like me turns out fabulous breads and rolls
this recipe is easy and l nailed it the first time will never buy bread again
i made this recipe as directed turned out almost perfect i love it the next time i mad it i did not have the active dry yeast i substituted rapid yeast aka instant yeas and the bread turned out even better i did not change anything except of activating the yeast really fluffy and still full bodied there is a slight change in flavor it is has a little less yeast smell but not anything to change my mind i highly recommend this recipe especially for the first time baker this is almost fool proof
if this is supposed to be a recipe for beginning break makers which i39m not and you make a video to give added instructionshouldn39t the video do it like the recipe states in the video she doesn39t put the half teaspoon in with the water and yeast she doesn39t show any bubbles on top of the yeast and she doesn39t let it rise a second time i made this recipe to the best of my abilities followed the written recipe to the letter and i39m with the other writers who experienced a fiasco i don39t see how there can be so many rave reviews what really makes me angry is i wasted 6 cups flour and a pkg of yeast at a time when those 2 supplies are hard to come by if i could give this recipe and the author a negative interger of stars i would
i was super excited to try and make this bread recipe because it was my first time the process was a bit frustrating but the end result was perfect really liked and so did my friends
easy recipe to follow nice textured bread
first time attempting bread this recipe worked great even with whole wheat flower turned out awesome
kyunger if you are running out of yeast and still have some flour look at recipes for irish soda bread it may be easier to get your hands on bicarbonate of soda bread soda so quick so easy and very delicious x
this recipe guideline was easy to use with amazing results the bread is delicious and going on day 2 still fresh and moist it was my first try i39ve never baked bread before and i was thrilled with the results try out this recipe it is good
just came out of the oven and we have eaten half of the first loaf it39s delicious
is active dry yeast and instant yeast the same if not how can i can use instant yeast to this recipe
for those not finding yeastfirst store it in your freezer stops the aging process 2nd go to a local food coop or i go to my bakery and by in a pound package put in freezeronce opened it goes in glass jar in the back of fridge freezercoldest spot same with if i use gluten to add i do not buy bread flour i know how many tb gluten needs to be added to ap flour for my recipes i create
my rating has to do with the equipment used this is supposedly a recipe is for 34beginners34 how many beginners have a dough mixer instructions for making the bread truly 34by hand34 would be wonderful
outstanding and simple bread the taste is terrific i have one package of yeast left during the pandemic so we are eating the bread sparingly nobody has any yeast great bread
what is bread flour can all purpose flour be used i39ve never made bread before so any help would be greatly appreciated
i had seen this recipe and then lost it so was going from memort i used 2 pks of yeast instead of 1 it was fantastic chewy soft and that yeadty flavor i love this makes a wonderful base for cinnamon rolls hint hint
is there a high altitude adjustment available we live at 580039 and would love to make it
the house smelled amazing while this was baking absolutely thought i had died and gone to heaven with my first slice it also makes very good toast you will never need another white bread recipe
bread tastes amazing however time is misleading on the recipe since it needs a few hours to rise any other time i read recipes completely before making them but i was in a rush and didnt until half way thru i only jad about an hour to let it rise and then put in oven still turned out great and everyone loved it i did add just about 12 c of whole wheat flour
amazingly good
paige whole wheat flour absorbs more water than white white flour so either you need to increase the amount of water or decrease the amount of flour i39d you want to keep a similar texture you can try substituting 5070 of the white flour for whole wheat flour
whole wheat flour is not interchangeable with all purpose or bread flour if you want to make whole wheat bread find a recipe written specifically for whole wheat the rise times will be completely different and the flour to liquid ratio will be different as whole wheat absorbs liquid much more than white flour hope this helps
super easy tastes great
i dont know what happened with mine i followed the recipe and when i baked it it didnt rise and it39s still doughy i used whole wheat flour please help
tasty easy to follow recipe my family definitely approved yum delicious
fantastic recipe i followed the recipe and it turned out prefect my first time making bread i did youtube on activating yeast and how to tell when you have knead enough very good flavor and great for beginners
i haven39t tried this recipe yet i am wondering if wholewheat flour can be substituted
a very good recipe for nice sandwich bread obviously the amount of flour and water depends very much on the temperature humidity and elevation so it would have been helpful to be very specific about what the dough should look and feel like at each stage since this is a recipe but it makes great bread if you want rustic bread i swear by the recipe on the king arthur flour website absolutely foolproof a mediocre baker but never messed up that recipe ever
ok everyone with bread more flour more dense less flour more fluffy i do 12 recipes and i rarely use more than 25 cups of flour once you learn this this recipe along with your breadmaking skill in general is great
the amount of flour is a suggestion i used to make bread every friday and just getting back to it so i knew that depending upon the humidity sometimes i use 6c or 65c or 575c finish adding the flour during the hand kneading process and you39ll never go wrong
absolutely one of the best lightest tastiest white breads i have ever made and there39s been a few thank you to steve for the suggestion regarding flour started out with 6 cups and added as neededkneaded ended up with the whole 6 34 cups the only thing i did different was i used a couple of tips i had from various cinnamon roll recipes that work the first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave starting with 1 minute then add 10 to 20 more seconds until you reach 110115 deg f then add yeast and 12 tsp sugar while mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to 200 deg f then turn off and allow to cool slightly then put the dough in there to raise door closed i use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel left in there for full 2 hrs and when it came time to put into pans i covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking i haven39t had an issue with dough rising since i started using this method as long as yeast is before 34best by34 date
to anyone who has trouble making bread where it comes our hard or too dry making bread is not an exact science the amount of flour you use isn39t going to exactly match what is in this recipe or any recipe the amount varies depending on temperature and humidity if it39s cool andor dry in your house you will use less flour you will have to adjust by feel and texture as you knead the dough don39t add all the flour at once it also helps to have a small pan with some water on the rack below the bread pan this adds additional humidity while you bake the bread giving a nicer crust
love this bread my wife and family also love this delicious sandwich bread definitely doesn39t require all of the flour i used around 5 cups everything else is spot on though to quote holly i felt like an instant bread expert i have already made this recipe 2xs the first time with all purpose flour came out dry and spongy the second time i used baking flour and the bread was perfect crisp yet chewy thank you
sorry but the recipe is wrong for those above sea level reason is not enough water which will evaporate the ratio should be 1 cup of water to 2 cups of flour per loaf of bread oil can be higher ratio the bread when it rises will create its own heat so if you have dry flower that is why change the ratio of water to flower for number of loafs
my dough turned out hard and feels like the 6 cups of flour is too much the video looks like its super easy and runny mine is hard and like a puzzle comes off pieces by pieces am i doing it wrong i followed the recipe
this is the first bread recipe i have made that did not come out rubbery or extremely dense i was impressed after watching the video i realized my dough was not the proper consistency according to the flour and liquid ratio in the recipe i only used 5 14 cups of flour as 6 was far too much and did not mix well i will make this again as it was delicious i feel like an instant bread expert thank you
used olive oil instead
turned out pretty good for my first time making bread made bread before but it never worked out i basically mad bricks until now and this recipe turned out pretty good
i had to add some water and a little bit more oil to the recipe i was not getting the soft dough consistency with the amount of water in the recipe i added warm water a little bit at a time until a soft dough formed it ended coming out great though my boyfriend loved it he made a sandwich with it and said it was perfect
this is a great fast bread recipe and to answer one of the questions below yes you can use a stand mixer i used the whisk for the initial mixing and then switched to the kneading hook for the 810 minutes suggested in the recipe turned out fantastic
can you make this with out a mixer and have it still come out fine
my bread used to always come out either really dry or way too dense and chewy this is the first recipe that gives me consistently good results now i use it as a base and make little alterations to experiment in the kitchen i39ve got a lemon pepper garlic bread rising now
am i understanding that i am supposed to let the dough rise twice as the directions say in step 2 and also in step 3 so far this has been a very simple and easy recipe to follow for this first time bread baker
good quality recipe and bread thank you
i use this recipe as a template as an experienced baker i can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic to answer some other concerns it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes this fully activated the yeast and can improve results to the person whose bread came out doughy have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate often home ranges can vary in actual temperature
this is a five star recipe all the way its a perfect recipe every time and everyone loves it including me
this is a wonderful recipe to make it39s easy
ok i just used your receipe and the bread is doughy in the middle im going to cook it a little longer then let you know if i like this recipe
have been using this recipe for years and i love it always consistently good bread
do you need to let the yeast wake up before you start mixing in the remaining yeast
my wife and i made this bread tonightamazing unbelievably awesome first time making it is and our three kids are hooked thank you
best recipe i have tried and i have been trying to find a really good bread recipe for a long time the bread is light and fluffy thank you my search is st an end
i made your recipe and it is the best i love it made some this morning and we ate awesome sandwiches for lunch yes thank you and bless you
just finished making up this bread recipe i39ve attempted to make bread in the past with no success i39m crossing my fingers and toes that it turns out i39d love to have found an easy bread recipe that i can repeat week after week this way i can keep my family healthier as well as save some money on our grocery bill each month we are practicing staying debt free and although we can afford it we stick to a very strick budget gotta lunch them pennies where we can bread is on the rise now i39ll post a review on the final outcome stay tuned
this was such an easy recipe and the result was awesome im super impressed i39ve tried a bunch of recipes and this is a winner
i don39t buy bread at the store all the crap you buy there and most of the flour mixes have bromate so i finally decided to buy bromate free flour and try to cook wait is it took or make or make make bread it was easier than i thought it would be to make its rising right now kinda huge i realized though that i don39t have any bread pans so this is going to be an interesting experiment going to toss it on a cookie sheet and eat what happens i like that the recipe was so easy i don39t like the ads i have to scroll through in the middle of the page i39ll try this again next week i think
i followed the directions perfectly and had a blob of sticky dough i added more flour after turning out onto wax paper because of the lack of work area i have had to use the stovetop i added even more flour after failing in the use of yeast 4 times i sure hope this bread tunrs out good it is rising as i type
i followed exactly what the recipe says and this bread turns out perfect every single time i had never made any kind of homemade bread before and this was so easy it does take some time simply because how long it takes the dough to rise but the amount of time actually making and working with the dough is not long at all my family loves this bread and i have actually had some people purchase loaves off of me as well i was even told that it is better than bread from amish country thanks so much for this recipe i will definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to make their own bread
is it possible to make this recipe with almond milk
i have been making this bread every sunday for about a year now a fantastic sandwich bread i make 2 loaves every sunday for sandwiches for the week i brush some butter on the tops of them as soon as out let them cool for a couple hours then slice them and stick them in the freezer ready for sandwiches
is it possible to use this recipe in a large food processor
i have made it several times now perfect thank you
love this bread i39m making it for a second time due to the fact my family can39t get enough i don39t mind because it39s super simple to make and comes out perfect every time
good basic white bread i bake a lot of fancy breads and thought i would give this a go and it came out fine i also made it out of a pan and just did two free standing loaves it had a nice crust and the bread itself had a nice 39sopping up39 power with my tomato based sauce it was a little heavier than store bought mass produced 39halfbaked39 store bought garbage but that is obviously to be expected we went through both in less than 2 days i39d make it again for those having issues following directions is key use bread flour be patient put away your bread machine temp your water let the starter work don39t use too much flouronly what it needs you probably won39t need all 6 cups if this isn39t taking you a good 34 hours to make you39re doing it wrong
another amazing bread recipe they came out perfect
my favorite home made bread ever easy to make and lovely warm with butter i use the 3 tbsp sugar as stated in the ingredients list and not the 12 cup it says in the directions though that bit was confusing at first lol i just follow the ingredients list and proofed the yeast then added the other ingredients to that in my stand mixer adding the flour a half cup at a time till the last half cup then i just kind of throw pinches at it till it looks right haha beautiful bread thank you
i39ve made this several times i added sausage cheeses garlic onion and herbs and it is absolutly amazing try it you will love it thanks for the recipe
stupid easy to make i forgot to grease the top of the bread but that didn39t seem to affect it much also for those curious you can definitely replace canola oil with olive oil and regular sugar with brown sugar or truvia brown sugar blend if that39s all you have if using truvia blend make sure to follow the sugar to truvia conversion in the back of the bag thanks so much for this awesome recipe will try making these on a weekly basis and see if i can save money on store bought bread
thanks for this looks so easy and delicious i will try to do this one
delicious i am extremely impressed it turned out great and it was my first time ever baking experiment has anyone tried putting seeds in it just wondering if that would work on another note i suggest using olive oil instead of canola it gives the perfect kick
literally the only thing baked looked kinda weird and i forgot the canola oil but it was still yummy good recipe for a valiant first attempt hopefully remember the oil next time
my very first time making bread and it came out great i honestly think ever gonna buy store bought white bread again super easy and cheap to make mine was a little on the dense and salty side so maybe use a tad bit less salt but still sooo good
oh my god this nonbaker made this bread today and it is fantastic i used a little less than 6 cups of flour followed the directions to the 34t34 and shaped them into round loaves because why would i have 2 loaf pans i greased 2 9x9 cake pans with bacon fat shortning and smeared them with a little of it before i popped them on the oven thirty minutes later with a ten minute cool down and boy is this bread yummy super delicious and not real heavy great recipe thank you toh
absolutely the worst bread recipe ever there was way to much flour it was like the sahara desert in my mouth
new at this homemade bread thing enjoying it very much but this recipe has been the best by far texture was awesome best that i39ve made i save this recipe on my phone instead of trying to find it again and plenty of thumbs up from everyone
bread tastes really good and it was fairly simple to make but it crumbles a bit and was hard to make into sliced bread it didn39t rise as well as i would have liked
excellent bread with the exception of an overkill on the salt should it not be 1 tsp not 1 tbsp if not why
just came out very nicemy everyday breakfast is now changed to breadthank you very very very very very muchwish you the best
question could i substitute self rising flour for the ap thanks
made this bread for the first time for easter nice workout kneading the bread for sure i did use a little over two tablespoons of sugar and two teaspoons of salt based on other reviews and used an egg wash we had a couple of slices with bolognese for dinner and even the end slice was tasty this is a great recipe that i will make again need to just have the time to let it rise
this message is for cathy i had the same problem with my bread machine the solution is to take the dough out after the knead cycle and let it rise in your own pans it seemed like the machine was not allowing it sufficient time to rise bake according to the directions good luck
bread turned out great could i use honey to sweetin and result
i have bread machine and would like to know if this recipe will help me make better bread in machinemy bread comes out too hard and heavy
omg i39ve always sucked at bread until this recipe awesome it came out great my daughter kept asking for more
i39ve gone through many recipe39s trying to find one that was simple good texture and taste great my search is over this is the one i39ve been looking for
great recipe best bread made so far turned out exactly as hope and has risen perfectly topped mine with shallots and grated cheese before baking for a bit of added flavour definitely recommend you try this one
i am a baker by trade but when i39m home i like to use this very simple recipe i do use an egg wash and i reccomend a very light sprinkling of flakey salt it is delicious and beautiful
this recipe is to simplistic and not detailed enough by not letting the yeast sit i believe it caused the bread not to rise high enough this resulted in 2 loafs that were shorter than they should39ve been i also reccomend a egg wash before cooking the texture of the bread was sorta like cornbread and a little mushy but not to bad really not great or terrible it was very crumbly and hard to cut thin slices
recipe reads simple the recipe is easy to understand does the recipe go well with a bread machine
did anyone else even come close to using 6 cups of flour i used met before and it came out perfectly
i made this bread 2 different times once i realize that my yeast was no longer active and ended up with a very dose loaf but my kids still loved it even i did then i made the second round with an active yeast and it was much better my youngest while having his first couple bites send to me this is the best bread seriously oh my gosh you should be a hahahaha i totally took credit too lol thanks for this easy recipe definitely a winner around my place
have been baking bread for over 50 years this recipe by far has the best taste texture and easiest recipe i have tried thank you for sharing sandra today was my second time using this recipe i know i will be using it very often
just wondering if you can substitute the ap flour with whole wheat flour thanks
this recipe is the best i bake ever and i consider myself a complete novice in the kitchen and i just made this for the first time and i had to eat half a loaf it was so good i threw in a couple handfuls of dried cranberries omg make this if you want to impress people too bad i only have my dog to impress lol she had a slice
omg the best i used this recipe for the first time last night the bread came out perfect so moist and delicious my daughter couldn39t get enough i used a glass loaf dish and followed the directions step by step will definitely use this recipe again
question for the author or a successful user of this recipe are you baking at 375 degrees in a dark or light pan other bread recipes i see run around 400 deg and a light pan which do you use at 375
first time making bread was a week or so ago i decided the best thing to do was keep it simple and this bread turned out amazing my gf was pretty impressed to see that i had made bread too here i am again a week later making it again lt3
yummy
i baked this bread earlier today and it was so easy it turned out great and is very delicious my 2 year old loved it
i loved the recipe and it was my first time ever making it my family and friends injoy eating it
easy to follow turned out really good my family loved it i did bake both loafs together and baked it for 40 minutes instead of 35 i have convection oven otherwise perfect
full disclosure not the best bread recipie i39ve came across in some 40 years of baking bread by hand but it does get 5 stars because it39s so easy and reliablei use bulk flour sugar and even yeast no need tp buy premium ingredients heretips 34proof34 the yeast water and sugar for at least 10 minutesmake sure the water isn39t over 115 degreesdo not over rise or over bakeit works fone for me
this recipe was given to me by my neighbor i thought i would make it today and it turned out horrible omg it was terrible the bread did not rise at all i39m not sure why this happened i39m not sure why everyone has given this bread recipe five stars if i could i would give it zero i have made bread before and it always turned out great i followed the directions to the tee i am thinking i should have used bread flour instead of allpurpose flour i am very disappointed i39m planning on throwing this recipe in the garbage i plan on making bread from the youtube channel jenny can cook now jenny can make delicious bread and it turns out good every time
this is an excellent recipeits so easy and so good i halved both loaves after the first halves to make twists then egg washed and sesame seeds beautiful loaves
love this bread i make it at lease twice a month comes out perfect every time
i love this bread eady to make and wonderful
this is the best and easiest bread recipe i made a few adjustments but the foundation recipe for ingredients measures and prepcooking were straight from this recipe i used bread flour instead of ap flour olive oil on place of the canola that39s what i had on hand and threw in some savory spices to give it a kick and it rose up better than any recipe i39d ever used plus i put a dash of olive oil in the dough because i read that bread flour dough can be dry
this is any easy bread recipe to make i cut my the next day and it sliced pretty easily not breaking all apart
my husband and i love this bread it doesn39t take me all day to make which is a big plus and it tastes great i have it for breakfast make my husbands lunch with it and serve it at dinner when we want bread i don39t use quite so much sugar or salt and the results are still great
real good but i couldnt get it to fit to well in my microwave but once i put it in a bowl it fit just fine it tasted even better with cinnamon on it trust me
simple and absolutely amazing i have baked bread homemade and from scratch all my life as i am a jewish woman this recipe is easy and simple but gives you the finest of bakeries taste bakeries that rate outstanding at 5 stars incredible and an absolute must try
thank you thank youmy bread came out great i even had extra dough to make cinnamon bread this is my go to bread no more store brought bread
if you are looking for bread your grandma made you fond it i believe make great rolls cinnamon rolls i used my stand mixer to make the dough i have been making bread for some time this is the best i have found be sure to let your bread cool down you my not be able to cut it until next day i don39t how old my yeast is it came from a food bank in a bag we put in a pizza jar and keep it in the relegate
this is a delicious bread recipe if you own a kitchenaid stand mixer use the dough kneading attachment and set the timer for 89 minutes instead of doing it by hand unless you want a workout
this was my very first time making bread and it turned out perfect i really love the ease of this recipe i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make bread
excellent
really yummy and easy to make i39d recommend halving the salt though
i keep yeast in the freezer and use as needed i39m using yeast from my freezer now that is over five years old still very active
new to making homemade bread and have a question i tried this and followed this recipe exactly the top and bottom of loaf were brown and baked well but the middle was still too doughy to eat what can i do thanks
old yeast isn39t necessarily dead i39ve used rapid rise yeast that39s close to 8 months beyond the expiration date and it worked perfectly however if the yeast was stored in a warm area either in your home or in a warehouse somewhere along the line that could kill it long before the expiration date dissolving it in water that39s too hot will do it in too best to have the water 105 to 110 if you set it out to rise is in a cold room that will prevent any rising i warm the oven a bit before i start and turn it off after a minute or so when it39s around 100 that seems to work well for rising if the dough doesn39t rise even after it39s set in the oven to bake then the yeast was dead
i made this bread tonightit turned out great i did take advice of a previous review and raised my dough in an oven preheated to 200 you turn the oven off before putting your dough in i love this simple yummy bread recipe
no mention of preheating oven before baking i know it39s a given thing to do but not all of us are bakers i googled just to make sure that i should preheat my oven bread turned out delicious this one is a keeper a little sweet will use less sugar next time
shareel it could be that you had old yeast if it is old your bread won39t rise whatever you do i would suggest trying the recipe again with fresh new yeast that hasn39t expired
ann do you put the bread dough in the warm oven to rise my email is owenjcyahoocom
i used this recipe when i decided to start making bread again perfect i preheat the oven to 200 degrees then shut it off as i39m kneading and the dough rises perfectly my husband is always happy when i39m making this and prefers it to store bought bread
this recipe is awesome i made it just like the recipe stated it was perfect i will be making more today my whole family loved it for people who can39t get the bread to rise try putting it in front of a small heater it helped mine rise a lot
first time i made bread was very easy and came out perfectly thank you
fail followed the recipe to par but the bread didnt rise at all not sure what eent wrong but the flour didnt rise before or during baking any suggestion or idea why
i am not experienced with yeast breads at all this is the second one i39ve made i followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded with two beautiful and delicious loaves of bread the crust came out just right crispness and the texture on the inside is delightful soft delicious i am so proud of how they turned out easy to follow directions will definitely use this recipe againedit my family tried it later in the day and all 4 of them lost their mind over the deliciousness and i received specific compliments on crust and texture this bread is really a hit
scale of 110ease of prep 9 super easy just toss in a bowl and mixcooking time 8 it39s about average for breadstexture 8 still a little fluffier than i like but the crust as flakymoisture 9 has enough that i didn39t feel like a slice needed some kind of spreadflavor 6 sweeter than i like less sugar next time
i have never baked anything before the homemade bread recipe was excellent and easy thank you
omg i made this bread for my fist time to make bread and it was ausome thank you for letting me use the recipe i39ll use it many more times thanks again d from texas
this recipe worked great i have been looking for a good basic bread recipe to go with some amazing jam we are giving away this christmas i looked through the comments and took folks39 common advice and it turned out really well bloom the yeast in the warm water with the sugar mix and let proof for 10 minutes before incorporating the other ingredients also hand knead this dough i am on my second batch having done the hand kneading as opposed to the dough hook this time around and it has turned out even better than the first time this is an easy nofuss recipe that turns out great
this is my go to recipe i am a novice bread baker and was a bit nervous if this recipe would work out i am glad i did it39s a hit every time the only thing i would like to share is the first time the bread lost moisture and so was a bit hard but then a friend told me to put a tray with water on the bottom rack to create a steam oven i am glad i got this tip the bread comes out moist on the inside and crusty on the outside
my family loves this recipe i use it to make rolls perfect crusty but soft bread love it
can i safely halve this recipe particularly the yeast there39s just me and my beloved that i39m baking for so i don39t want two loaves yet
thanks
is this right on the salt 1 tablespoon salt seems like a lot
didn39t think i would get it right but somehow i did then i started doing twice the recipe and ended up with substituting some flour with wheat bran and try different shapes i ended up with baguettes subs bread and buns all in one cooking session even tried some maple amp cinnamon bread which ended up great
i usually fail miserably at anything connected with yeast but i made 2 successful loaves with this recipe i took the advice of previous reviewers and mixed the water sugar and yeast and let it stand to proof it i also looked up other tips online like 34how to tell when bread is risen enough not just 34doubled3434 34how to tell when bread is ready to bake34 34how to tell when bread is thoroughly baked34 with those tips i produced 2 nice loaves the only thing i would have liked is a finer texture i39ve only been able to produce that in the past using the sponge method i will use this recipe again
steph try using warmer water 120 to125 degrees air humidity and temperature are most important your dil
omg first time i ever baked bread this recipe is the best first time and easy to follow instructions will make it more of it and tasty nice and fluffy
i love how easy it is to follow too bad i didn39t follow it i forgot to put the oil in didn39t even clue in until i was reviewing cook times we shall see i will rereview once i39ve tried it
i39ve been making this bread for the last 6 years and my family loves it this bread is easy to make and tastes wonderful too this bread is a staple in our home
great easy recipe and a first time bread maker like me can make great tasting bread and so easy to make
the best bread recipe that i have ever used beautiful and very delish my now go to bread recipe
making this recipe for the second time this week it39s easy and delicious i mix the yeast water and sugar in the bowl first wait ten minutes and then add in the salt flour and oil i use a blend of bread flour whole wheat and ground flax seed it makes loaves that are light and not too crusty
i created an account just to rate this excellent recipe which i followed exactly as written i know some people have commented that it39s important to activate the yeast but i didn39t do that i just did what the recipe said and it worked out fine i also used regular old allpurpose flour some have said it39s important to use some kind of special bread flour and it was perfect light fluffy with a crust that wasn39t too hardexactly what i wanted i39m not sure what happened with the folks who called this recipe 34terrible34 and said they ended up with bread that was inedible all i can say is their experience is nothing like minehighly recommended
i tried this recipe once and it was terrible the second time i used 14 cup water and 1 tablespoon sugar dissolved the sugar and then added the yeast cover the yeast and let it set for 10 minutes until frothy after that i added the rest of the ingredients and kneeded the living carp out of it everything turned out perfect this time light fluffy and yeasty it was delicious just active the yeast in this way and it will turn out fine
first time baking bread and this recipe was so easy to follow and bread came out delicious crust was just right perfect height and density i used 6 14 cups of king arthur39s unbleached bread flour and added a touch of honey i will be making my own bread and rolls from now on using this basic recipe
turned out great
i just made this bread and it turned out marvelous however i feel like it has some important steps left out that you need to know if you39re not an experienced bread baker first of all to activate your yeast you need to put the warm water and yeast and sugar alone in your bowl stir it well cover it and set it aside when it39s frothy looking those foamy looking bubbles mean the yeast is ready to go then add all the other ingredients otherwise it39s a great basic recipe make sure to work the dough long enough i do half with a dough hook and my kitchenaid and half by hand on a flour dusted counter it needs to feel really smooth and stretchy good luck it tastes delicious and a perfect texture
literally the worst bread i have ever made i can39t believe it got so many positive reviews i made this twice the first time i thought it was my oven that had ruined it or maybe the yeast wasn39t good enough however the second time through i had the right ingredients fixed the oven and i had the worst results it is best to try another recipe
awesome awesome awesome bread so good as a sandwich killer as mop up bread with gravy even better with garlic seasoning and butter lightly toasted i have made this bread six times now and everyone loves it thanks so much
i have made this twice and after the first rise don39t knead the dough it makes it very dense on my second bake it was half as dense but it was still dense if you don39t knead it enough before the first rise the glutton won39t build enough to become light and fluffy
worked out great
surely something was left out of this recipe followed recipe exactly and it was terrible don39t know how it got any stars wasted ingredients
love this simple recipe this is my 1st time baking white bread at home i have baked spelt flour recipes a couple of times and came out good love the taste instead of adding only all purpose flour i added 312 cups all purpose and the rest spelt flour also added a tblspoon of flax seed powder i have never loved white bread like this before next time i will definitely use all all purpose flour i am a beginner in bread baking this recipe really made me confident abt my bread baking skills thank you
was super easy to make and turned out well the directions were simple and easy to follow
i39ve made this bread several times already the first time was good and has only gotten better each time i concur with ryan below about using bread flour i used king arthur but i use my wife39s beloved kitchenaid stand mixer which more than meets and exceeds the challenge of kneading i also divide the dough into thirds and can even go for four small loaves and it does keep for a few days if it lasts that long d the final bread product when made with bread flour is a good crumb nice chew and wonderfully crispy yet soft crusta wonderful beginner39s recipe i39ll experiment with adding herbs and other flavors to this dough
when you say 14 ounce of yeast does that equal to 7grams of yeast i have access to dry yeast by the packets each packet contains 1 g of dry yeast do i use 7
making this bread right now not sure if it will turn out because i used olive oil not canola oil used pizza crust yeast its what i had available at the time
i actually signed up on here to leave a review i never leave reviews for recipes i39ve tried but i made this bread and this was the first time i got bread right the dough was stiff yet workable it raised well and i actually got 4 loaves instead of just the 2 it tasted delicious and this is the recipe i39d pass down to my generation of family it39s that amazing
simply outstanding i39ve made this recipe more than once several times at high elevation in denver another time atnear sea level in houston i never leave reviews for recipes but felt the need to pay it forward on this one pro tip based on experience and experimentation use unbleached bread flour if you want a softer crust i39ve used standard allpurpose bleached flour but the crust ends up too hard it39s almost too difficult to cut through it in the end i much prefer the softer crust as for the rest of the recipe follow it it39s perfect i mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and literally a regular fork yes my arm begins to ache by the time i39ve added the 4th cup of flour also if you are a breadbaking newbie like i was i used advice found online to determine if my bread had risen enough on both the 1st and 2nd rise
awesome easy bread recipe loaf just came fresh out of the oven yum perfect ingredient portions even works with himalayan pink salt for regular salt amp pure cane sugar instead of regular when i divided the dough in half made that one loaf and divided the other half in two put them in refrigerator for future use thanks for sharing
could this recipe be doubled
my family and i are absolutely in love with this recipe i only halved the recipe and came out best it39s the bomb this is my go to bread recipe from now on
this recipe was a total fale in my books not only should you just dissolve the yeast in warm water and then it says to ad your sugar and salt right away with the flour did they forget the part where you should let your yeast stand i prefer to take warm water with suger dissolved in it and then ad the yeast and let it stand then after 10 minutes i will mix in the flour salt butter and water and or milk mine never even came up an inch i threw it away
guys this recipe worked my family loved it so from now on we prefer making our own bread at home save money and way delicious yes guys thanks to the owner god bless
this was perfectly simple and delicious i made it just as written i started with 5 cups of flour but easily made it to 65 cups while kneading the dough i only have one bread pan so i put half of the dough in a loaf pan and made the rest as a round loaf in a casserole dish both turned out great i39m sure we will be making this again soon
i had no idea what i was doing making bread on my own for the first time this recipe is so easy for the beginner and the only problem i had with the bread was how quickly my family scarfed it down thank you so much
i have never been able to bake bread it was always a waste i am loving this recipe i could tell by the dough that it would be good but it wa really great after the 3 cups of flour i did what the recipe advised and added the extra flour 12 cup at a time and 512 cups did the trick plus extra for kneading i made a nice round loaf a regular sized loaf and 6 cinnamon rolls that i made by adding a mixture of sugar brown sugar cinnamon butter and a bit of flour and vanilla and heaping it on top of the rolls before baking everything tasted delicious i39m hooked will be baking this bread alot thank you
simply delicious my husband loved it too
it was delicious and easy to make i would recommend putting an egg wash or butter over the loaf before cooking to make it look better though
i accidentally doubled the amount of sugar salt and oil i tried to cut the recipe in half mistakes were made but the bread still came out looking and tasting amazing i imagine my accidental adjustments just made for a more flavorful loaf which is nothing i39m complaining about i would definitely make this again
absolutely perfect i have been searching for an easy picture perfect yeast bread recipe for 50 years the first recipe i tried i threw away the loaf this is fool proof and yes i did modify used only 5 cups flour then extra for dusting only used 2 tsp of salt if i could add a picture i would i drove in a thunderstorm to take slices to neighbor because i needed a witness as how wonderful it was a man would marry you in a heartbeat if you served thislol
very easy i think there39s a bit too much sugar though it could do with maybe one tablespoon less
my family and i love this recipe for bread 1st try and success for starters start here i watched a youtube before attempting to get the process down
first time 34bread maker34 from scratch omg this is as good as chocolate a must repeat recipe simply outstanding
this is essentially the betty crocker white bread recipe from the 1950 cookbook which i no longer have so i was happy to find a similar recipe the only difference i can see is the betty crocker recipe called for shortening or lard rather than canola oil i compromised and used butter lol also if i39m not mistaken the betty crocker recipe says to bake at 425 not 375 i39m going to give this 375 a go this time and stick to the recipe as written other than the butter that isbecause it looks like it39s a winner as writteni just want to say i39m a touch annoyed by reviewers who leave one star then go on to explain how they changed this and that and had bad results and won39t make the recipe again how about actually following the recipe and if you don39t it39s a little unfair to onestar the posted recipe when it39s your changes that probably really failed just a thought and yes one tablespoon of salt is the correct amount
i used this recipe to make my first bread in the oven i39ve used a bread machine before easy to make and tastes great i used 534 cups of flour
i had never made bread before trying this recipe it is so good i39m now making loaves for my neighbors for christmas i also added cheese and jarred jalapeos and was worried that it would mess up with not changing any of the other measurements turned out delicious turned out delicious thank you for this recipe
i just made this amazing bread and it tastes great i only needed 55 cups of flour and it still came out quite dense i baked in the oven one level up from the bottom with a cookie sheet on the bottom level this keeps the bottom from getting too burntit came out looking exactly like the picture my kids love it too this is great cause i hate breadmakers since the belt eventually slips on them and they make more noise now i can make bread with no preservatives
i love this recipe and so does everyone whose tasted it i had to start dividing the dough into three portions and put the loaves into smaller pans since my family nearly inhales it every time i make it i don39t even need to adjust the baking time they turn out beautifully every time as for the amount of flour i think the recipe is only showing you what you will need before you start like say you only need 5 cups of flour for the bread what happens if you only have that much flour you can39t knead the bread so well cuz you ran out i tested how much i end up using after my dough is ready to be kneaded and i use almost another whole cup of flour
i want my bread to look like the one in the picture mine wasn39t golden brown but i39ll try it again
perfecti39ve tried 2 other 34easy34 recipes over the last 2 days and both went in the trash i finally found this recipe and while reluctant because of the last 2 failures i decided to give this one a try i am sooooo glad i did not only are the ingredients simple but so is putting it together and making iti did make a few minor modifications based on some of the reviews i used 5 14 cups of flour instead of the 6 14 to 6 34 cups it calls for i found that the recommended amount of flour was just entirely too much i also used vegetable oil instead of canola because that39s all i hadthis bread is wonderful my husband son and mother ate a whole loaf in two hours the other loaf is almost gone todayit is so moist and soft i can39t believe it turned out this good i made everyone french toast this morning and grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch we will no longer spend 3 for a loaf of store bought bread i39ve finally found my tried and trusted recipe right heregood luck everyone enjoy this awesome recipe your family will thank you for it ps this site should allow us to post pictures to prove how our recipes turned out
love this recipe the bread was delicious we doubled the recipe and used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola oil it came out perfect i just decreased the salt as olive oil has a stronger taste as canola
this is exactly the same as the recipe i use in my bread machine just use half the ingredients and add an egg heaven one trick i do that really makes a huge difference is to spray surface with pam instead of dusting with four also spray your hands butter would work just as well
absolutely love this recipe i have made it several times now my husband and i have stopped buying bread and only eat what i make linda that posted nov 15 2016the olive oil will make it salty and taste a little weird i would recommend using either canola or vegetable oil corn oil may also work but haven39t tried it as long as you use the right type of oil one tablespoon of salt is perfect i also like to grease the bowl and pans with un salted butter it adds a nice slight butter taste
i was disappointed in this bread i wonder if the 1 tablespoon of salt is correct i don39t think i have ever added 1 tablespoon of salt to anything i have made i thought this bread tasted too salty i didn39t have canola oil so i used olive oil and sprayed the pans with pam not sure if those things had anything to do with the salty taste i will not be making this again
great recipe i like it better with 152 tsp of salt i also added some chopped jalapeno and cheddar cheese to one loaf it was great
can this be made in a bread machine
i have tried my entire life to make bread like this and i felt like queen for a day when i actually succeeded your recipe made learning it fun thanks for making a recipe that finally made me a success
oh my jesus such a simple and perfect recipe the bread is awesome soft on the inside a bit of crunch on the outside mmmh mmmh mmmh i made mine with a little less flour too about 5 cups and added raisins thank you so much for posting this
this is by far the most simplistic bread recipe i39ve ever come across i39ve tried so many bread recipes but i could never memorize them because of so many steps involved and the bread never came out exactly as the recipe39s image or as it should this recipe came out perfect my kids and husband loved it and i was able to memorize the steps so i can put my spin on it today i made it for the second time with 3 cups white flour and 3 cups wheat peerfect it39s a keeper
works great though i only need 5 12 cups of flour or it becomes too dense
this recipe is awesome i have never made bread before and was so worried that i39d be terrible at it because my mom never got the hang of it the only thing i did differently is i used instant yeast instead of the active dry because when i bought yeast before finding this recipe i didn39t know which to buy other than that i followed the recipe to a t the bread came out perfect i can39t believe i made perfect bread on my first try and it39s really yummy i39ll be using this recipe from now on and i39ll be making a lot more bread from here on out
easymine is rising the first time right now thinking about making it into cinnamon rollsto the person lucylinecm questioning the recipe it takes about 6 12 cups of flourupdateit was horrible didn39t rise maybe the yeast
this bread is the most consistently fantastic bread i have ever madeand i make a lot of bread i love the attention i get for this wonderful bread i don39t deserve the fuss really because it is dead easy to make ha ha
loved it i39ve never made bread before and this was so much easier than i thought it would be great by itself or for sandwiches
i made this bread today and followed the recipe pretty close including the rising times except for a couple ingredients i changed out 1 12 cups of the flour for whole wheat flour and used instant dry yeast 2 14 tsp 1 pkg yeast plus i added a little more yeast about 12 tsp because of the whole wheat flour i also sifted all the flour after measuring it raised beautifully and turned out very good it39s going to be my go to recipe for bread enjoying every slice
tried this recipe today super easy and my loaves came out really welllovely super soft texturethanks a bunch for the recipe
this recipe was so easy and my family loved it i have a question about making mini loaves what would be the cook time
my goto recipe for basic white bread easy and turns out well every time for a soft crust brush with a little butter when you take it out of the oven
thanks a lot for the easy to follow recipe and videos i39m a beginner bread maker and your video39s really help me thanks again from nz
i double this recipe and bake 4 loaves at a time because my family amp i love this bread so much it is a delicious recipe garlic cheese toast open pb amp j sandwiches and good ole buttered toast are just a few of our favorite ways to eat it my daughter just eats it plain and untoasted she likes it so much
easy amp simple recipe to follow delicious every time
currently enjoying this toasted with jam and a nice cup of coffee great recipe i found the sugar unnecessary so eliminated that and it tastes just as good also decided to just wing it on the flour add it until the dough was ready no more no less and that worked better than the first batchi39ve never baked bread before and this was the perfect beginner39s recipe so excited to try new twists on it as well
great bread easy recipe and it rose really well with a crusty outside and fluffy inside i made a loaf and some buns for burgers with the dough and they were perfect i read a couple reviews about the flour total being wrong the recipe does ask for 6 634 cups in total and i added that much and it was fine it asks for three cups first and then additional flour after as much as needed followed the recipe as is and it turned out as i would have hoped i will make this again and pass it on
followed the recipe as it is works fine tnx
why does the ingredient list say 6 cups of flour but they only tell you to put 3 into the dough plus some extra i put in a little extra to make the dough not stick but that was no where near 6 cups total i hope i39m not making this bread all wrong please fix the directions
great recipe i used half whole wheat and half white flour i also used olive oil instead of the canola oil called for this recipe calls for one tablespoon of salt i thought that was too much so i used less i should have added the full tablespoon the recipe called for the bread was still very good but when i make this again and i will add one tablespoon of salt thanks for the great bread recipe
tried this recipe for the first time and i was very pleased with the results i can39t offer any suggestions for improvements very simple recipe if you follow directions precisely you will get some really great bread hope it stays fresh for a couple days definitely worth making again
i39ve tweaked this a little to make it better for me atleast i use 3 teas yeast only rise once it makes it a lot less dense i also changed the temp around somelower like 10 degrees and it seems to make it even softer but still same time
is there a bread machine version of the classic white bread
i39m rating simply for the other reviews i39ll try this next week as for answering the questions from cdj516 whether the dough can be halved yes i can39t see any issues as for freezing the dough can39t say for sure i don39t usually freeze bread dough what i do is bake the whole recipe cool to room temp and divide each loaf into three for us that is the perfect size for a day or two i wrap the sections individually in plastic wrap then place into a freezer bag i grab out of the freezer as i need it thawing isn39t an issue takes 10 minutes or so
i am rating this based on looking for so long for a easy basic bread recipe this is exactly the 34basic34 bread recipe i have been looking for i have not made it yet but will very soon i am however concerned about how much bread it will make i have a small household so i am reaching out for advice has anyone tried to make only half of the recipe and also can this dough be frozen if i make the full amount and only bake one loaf of bread i love the other idea39s of what i can make with it your suggestions are great
excellent recipe for those asking about flour weight 142 grams 1cup and 5oz 1 cup i measure my flour on a scale for anything i make from scratch it makes all the difference
great recipe for bread definitely nostalgic of when my mother used to bake it for us this recipe is enough for two loaves
i like to substitute honey for the sugar turns out great
turned out really good i should39ve formed mine better i just dumped it in there so the top was a bit funky d i did halve this recipe my first attempt at making bread and it makes me want to try other recipes really tasty i39m glad it was a success
my whole family loves this bread and begs me to make more we have significantly cut out store bought bread and instead make this we have also used it as pizza crust and that was great too we made two pizzas out of one batch of dough but found the dough too thick a half recipebatch could make two pizzas or whole recipe for one loaf of bread amp two pizza crusts plan to try to add in whole wheat flour soon
the best recipe for homemade white bread i39ve ever tried it is moist and delicious with a hint of sweetness it is perfect my only regret is the fact that i love it hence i eat it waaaay too much
i made this recipe today and used 12 all purpose flour and 12 whole wheat the loaves turned out golden brown on the outside and a lovely light brown on the inside the bread was delicious the recipe was easy to follow and i will be using it again thanks for posting
i would like to make this bread but with less sugar would that be possible
great basic bread and just what i was looking for i substituted olive oil for canola oil and didn39t notice a difference i also turned one loaf into focaccia bread i put half the dough in an oiled 13 x 9 lasagna pan and sprinkled the top with minced fresh garlic and sliced olives i let it rise the second time and baked it alongside the regular loaf 10 minutes before it was done i sprinkled shredded cheese over the top very tastyalso used two tbsp sugar instead of three with no problem
really simple quick and tasty bread i used 5 cups of ultragrain white flour and found it to be the perfect texture with great rise as long as my kitchen was decently warm i let the loaves rise beside my crock pot while it was cooking some soup on low and that seemed to do the trick the taste was really lovely just a hint of sweet and not too yeasty with a nice crumb and golden crispy crust will be making this bread often
i have made this bread twice with bleached flour and whole wheat flour both turned out perfect and taste great easy recipe for a beginner bread maker thanx for the recipe
really needs to have weights for salt sugar and flour tasty recipe though
i followed the suggestion of using half all purpose flour and half bread flour i also needed 6 full cups of flour i made one loaf of bread and rolled the other half out into twelve cinnamon rolls my dough raised beautifully i have a proofing setting on my oven and let the loaf rise for 40 minutes which is about how much it took me to make the cinnamon rolls cinnamon rolls took about an hour to rise turned out great very easy dough to work with and this bread will go into my recipe rotation
i have a son who doesn39t like eggs butter and milk so i went looking for a bread recipe that don39t have eggs butter or milk the bread that i usually make has butter and milk i tried this recipe and had great success i have added it as my standard bread recipe thanks to sandra anderson for submitting the recipe and to taste of home for publishing it
i have made this bread several times over the past month and this is what i can tell you 1 the first time i made it i used all purpose flour as the recipe called for the bread came out really good 2 the second time i made it i used bread flour the bread came out really good in both the texture was good but just a bit different from each other then came 3 and this time i used a combination of 12 all purpose and 12 bread flour results perfect phenomenal bread this had a great texture and taste and this will be the way i make it from now onok now i like a few others have found that 5 cups of flour proves to be enough flourwhen i made bread tonight i made 2 small loaves and a pan of cinnamon rolls my husband and grandson loved them they said the taste and texture were perfect
i created an account just leave a review i am a novice baker baking for about two weeks now and my husband has been begging for years for a homemade bread recipe i finally broke down and googled 34homemade bread recipes34 and this was the first one i found and wow it came out so golden brown and delicious it rose beautifully and the recipe was so easy to follow my husband and i promptly devoured half the loaf once i pulled it out of the oven oops i am totally making pbampjs with this bread for tomorrow39s outing for me my husband and our son fantastic recipe thanks for sharing
reserving judgement until the b0oss weighs in
i found this recipe doing a search for an easy beginners bread recipe i love this recipe it raises for me every time i have recently begun to experiment with it by making rolls and cinnamon rolls very simple very versatile recipe and it will stay in my favorite recipes notebook i will say to the naysayers get a candy thermometer and check your water temperature my coworker told me the easiest way to fail at bread making is to have your water or milk too hot when you add your yeast also check your yeast expiration date
use this recipe in my bread machine and it never fails if you follow machine and yeast directions
excellent recipe many years ago a friend told me to buy a candy thermometer and to measure the temperature of the water to mix with yeast usually 110115 degrees this makes bread making much simpler
this is a very good basic bread recipe if yours didn39t rise it was because of reasons other than the recipe i agree with others who commented earlier that either your water was too hot yeast too old or you made a mistake somewhere in your making the bread try again following the directions
excellent tasty bread even my grandson liked it and very easy to makegoing to make more tomorrow
use 2 envelopes of dry yeast i did rose great i make challah and it uses 4 to 5 cups bread flour and requires 2 pkts yeast
this is the recipe my mom used for years for bread and cinnamon rolls it always came out perfectly i can39t make it to save my life because i hate making yeast bread it really does take 810 minutes of kneading i don39t have the patience the water has to be the correct temperature and the yeast has to be fresh if your yeast is expired toss it
i39ve baked bread all my life this is a very good basic recipe for bread and it spinoffs like cinnamon rolls some people i notice complain of the bread not rising either you got your yeast too hot with the water and killed it or did not take into account rising tempuratures or altitude do just make sure your yeast does not get too hot or cold and you should be fine
excellent recipe very easy to follow and super delicious definitely using this recipe again mixed 2 different flour types worked as a charmthank you
6 cups of flour would have been way too much i stopped at just over 5 cups plenty
this bread was excellent i39m so excited to have found this easy recipe i used honey instead of sugar and half whole wheat half all purpose flour delish thank you
easy to make and substitute whole wheat for white flourit was delicious
my whole family loved it i made two loaves and they were gone in two days
its not even finished yet n it already smells amazing ive tried a couple different bread recipes on here and i love them all
very simple yet awesome recipe everyone could smell the warm delicious bread aroma from outside we all loved it
such an amazing recipe just made it and my mom and dad loved it and so did i very simple a little lengthy process but totally worth it
i love this site it has awesome receipts that i can make for my family sooooooo happy
super easy an so delicious
thank you for such a marvelously easy bread recipe made this a couple of times i use all whole wheat flour and it makes a bread that tastes pretty much exactly like outback steakhouse39s bread helps with my diet because i try to cut preservatives and artificial ingredients out
made this today and not only is the recipe super easy it turns out so delicious a big hit in our house thank you for a wonderful bread recipe
great bread i just substitute 1 cup of water for 1 cup of milk and stuffed one with shered mozzarella and the other with cherries yummy yummy thanks for this great recipe
so good and easy i ground up a cup39s worth of steel cut oats and flaxseed in a coffee grinder and added it in place of another cup of flour trying to eat healthier it turned out great and nice texture this bread rose much better than another recipe i used and looks beautiful
delicious i used a heating pad to help the bread rise
best bread i have ever made tastes amazing my family loves it so simple to make and very little ingredients
this is way easy to make i love it
excellent and easy bread recipe i put water on the top of the bread when it comes out of the oven and wrap it in a towel to steam this creates a softer crust also use 12 wheat to 12 white flour for a wheat bread
very simple basic bread recipe also good for fry bread after letting it rise and beating it down simply form into rounds and fry until crispy brown
this recipe is very good thank you mine didn39t rise well but that was my fault my house was to coola question for the person before me cmolina1 why on earth would you give a recipe a 1 star because you didn39t read the recipe
for some reason i thought it said 3 cups flour i was wondering why i had to double that aside from me reading directions wrong its a fantasic basic recipe i would say add a tiny bit of spice to the water before mixing i added a pinch of garlic salt onion powder and italian season and just wow such a small amount of spice can go a very long ways
i39ve always had trouble finding the perfect bread recipe but i can finally quit looking this simple recipe bakes up perfectly and never disappoints
i love this i started with the recipe as written down and it turned out beautiful each time i have started making this with whole wheat flour half allpurpose half whole wheat and making a cinnamon raisin version i read in one of the reviews that is awesome it is my first and last bread recipe and is sooooooo good
we love this bread it39s so simple and easy to make and it tastes great my husband can39t get enough and that39s saying a lot since he39s not much of a bread eater
easy peasy
this is my first homemade bread recipe and it will be my last there is no need to look elsewhere i don39t knead it the 810 minutes as directed usually 5 minutes and it rises fine each time it will not rise as much with sea salt but i like the taste a little better believe it or not i am losing weight while eating this bread but only allow 2 slices per day with little other carbsso you can lose weight and eat delicious homemade bread
the first time i tried this my yeast was expired the water was too warm amp i didn39t wait long enough for the yeast to dissolve needless to say the bread didn39t rise and wasn39t very good while the 34bad34 loaves were in the oven i started a new batch with fresh yeast in the right temperature water amp showed some patience letting it dissolve the result was 2 beautiful loaves of bread such an easy recipe if you follow it i can39t wait to try some of the suggested variations
i really can39t get over this bread i made 2 batches every week i usually substitute 1 12 cups of ap flour with whole wheat it39s just lovely actually i just made some except after letting it rise i took one loaf worth kneaded in about 1c raisins then rolled it out rubbed on some butter and sprinkled on cinnamon sugar 1 12 tbspn cinnamon 3tbspn brown sugar and rolled it up let it rise and baked like the recipe says and ohmygoodness best raisin bread i have ever had just came out of the oven mmmmm
my first time and it was perfect slices wonderful for sandwiches and delicious and myfamily loved it they said more more more
two loaves were gone in one day family of 6 i39ve used other recipes but this was hugely successful
delicious very easy we don39t use sugar we use honey instead and it is just divine my loaf pans are slightly smaller so i39m able to break this into 3 even loaves i39ve made it twice already 6 loaves total never buying store bread again
i39ve always had issues making home made bread this recipe has not let me down yet the only thing i do differently is form the loaves by hand make a few slashes at the top for decoration and sprinkle a little corn meal on a greased cookie sheet it makes the loaves come off the pan easier these loaves go fast
absolutely the easiest and most delicious bread came out perfect the first time omg my husband and kids had the first loaf down by the evening will be making this on a regular basis i have had terrible success with my bread maker although i will continue to try to find the perfect recipe for it
this was the first time i have tried homemade bread and i will never try a different recipe it made 2 very large loaves and i can39t stop eating them i only have 1 loaf pan so i decided to just forgo them and put both of my loaves on a nonstick air bake cookie sheet they came out beautifully i went about 32 minutes until the internal temp was between 180 and 190 immediately after they came out i brushed the tops with olive oil it really softened it up but still has just enough of that homemade crunch i39m excited to try variations including whole garlic cloves apple and cinnamon chocolate pudding mix and chocolate chips and herbs and cheese we may never buy store bought bread again
great recipe my bread turned out perfect i do beat my bread down twice though to get a more even mix also in the recipe it says 3 cups and on the side of the recipe it says over 6 cups the 6 cups is the correct one if you cant get your bread to rise it39s because you39re missing over 3 cups of flour
i use to have issues with my bread rising it was due to the yeast not activating properlynow i have no issues at allmake sire your water temp is close to spot on usualy luke warm will do the trick
love it
my bread didnt rise i followed to the tee
very simple recipe i love that it only has 6 ingredients and uses all purpose flour i did a cost analysis and this recipe costs me less than buying store bought bread it comes out to about 005 per slice which is pretty cheap and it really doesn39t require much effort it does take some time but most of that is from rising and baking and i can still do other tasks while that39s happening so i think it39s worth it i39m definitely going to be using this as my goto bread recipe from now on my family loves it
huge hit with the family
easy enough for my kids to help smells great baking and tastes wonderful yummy
the first two loaves i made were gone in less than two days my kids were in love then i made two more and those were gone almost as fast i have now made a total of 8 loaves and we stopped buying bread from the store i cook it 30 mins baste them with butter and then cook them 5 more minutes then i baste them again when i take them out i didn39t have canola oil so i just use vegetable and it39s amazing
i have made this recipe a few times now and it has become my go to recipe i generally always end up using a mixture of whole wheat and regular all purpose flour and it turns out great i use this recipe not only for bread 39but also for homemade calzones and stromboli it really is a great all purpose bread dough
my family fell in love with this and keep asking for it again we give it 5 stars
these look great what fat ground beef do you recommend
i made this recipe exactly as written i love it i will definitely be making this on a regular bases i wonder how well it would freeze freeze before or after cooking the sauce is very good perfect glaze
it looks good can you tell us what is prepared mustard
i liked the review of using jalapeno ketchup so i diced up a fresh jalalpeno and added it to the meat mixture it was very good i liked the cheese inside the meatloaf have never done that before
used half regular ketchup half jalapeno ketchup so good made a double batch baked them cooled them and then froze them solid on cookie sheets and vacuum sealed them
mu husband loves meatloaf but i have never liked it i generally find them really dry no matter how much ketchup you drown it i reluctantly tried these and i love them very easy to make moist and full of flavor great as left overs also i do use a meat mix of 13 lb each of ground beef veal and pork i also add some hot sauce to the ketchupsugar topping for a little more kick and to balance the sweetness this is a repeat recipe
i love this recipe i make it all the time i halve the sugar in the sauce as a preference and it comes out perfectly still sweet and just perfect for our family it is one of my family39s trusted favorites thank you for the recipe
very tasty we loved the sauce this is a little different than my usual meatloaf recipe and i think my family actually liked this one better
these were easy to make and delicious mine as neat looking as the picture and i diced the onions smaller the flavor of the sauce is excellent i will definitely make these again
grandkids loved these and opa for a sandwich for work
these were delicious cut back on milk and brown sugar as i don39t like them too sweet they can also be frozen
since i tried this recipe it is my goto meatloaf everyone enjoyed
excellent recipe i add my own seasonings to the meat to add even more flavor try it you won39t be disappointed thanks for the recipe
made this with my daughter used a little less milk as i read in the reviews came out amazing will be making this again
very yummy my mom always made these growing up the only problem i have with the recipe is too much milk and makes the mixture too soupy i put 13 cup or less and it comes out much better texture the original recipe form taste of home cookbook calls for 1 5 ounce can of evaporated milk i need to try that
my family loved this recipe yummy
very easy and very tasty this will definitely be a 34goto34 dinner for me
i make two changes first i enshroud the peas in a ball of mashed potatoes the kids get a kick out of discovering the peas and not having to chase them all over there plates i also brown the potatoes in the oven second instead of the ketchup topping i make a good brown gravy that covers the meat loaf and potatoes yum yum
my boyfriend absolutely loved these
i made this as two loaves my only changes were to use onion powder and i cut the topping in half i have made it a few times and the kids really like it
these are hands down the best meatloafmeatballs recipe i have ever tried a win every single time
this is the same recipe my 93 year old mother made and it has always been a hit with everyone who is lucky enough to have a slice the only thing we did not include is the cheese however i just recently made it exactly as the recipe states and the cheese is a wonderful rich addition love this recipe it39s definitely a keeper
i have been making these for years very tasty and cook quickly leftovers reheat nicely
these are my goto weeknight meatloaf recipe they bake faster because they are single loaves and the cheesy flavor is great left overs can be frozen for future meals
omg its looking so tasty
these are the best meat loaf ves we have ever tried my entire family loves them just delicious
best ever i add bell peppers to it and usually double or triple it so i can freeze some for another meal i have taken it to family reunions as meatballs and everyone wanted the recipe
i don39t make any other type of meatloaf except these li39l cheddar mini meatloaves my entire family mom sisters mothinlaw all love this recipe always a hit
i cannot see the recipe because of the advertisement covering it i only see the partial ingredients egglands best takes up a huge square over the ingredients
a good beef dish should be juicy and full of aroma httpswebfacebookcomcookingplushomedecormodaladmintodotour
loved by everyone i doubled the recipe but did not double the cheese or the brown sugar the sauce was plenty sweet and could maybe even do with less sugar my husband said this was his favorite meatloaf recipe
this is my favorite meatloaf recipe ever i39ve been making these super tasty meatloaves since 1999 i make 6 loaves instead of 8 and cook for 4045 minutes i also cover the pan with foil for the first 20 minutes
it took more cooking time then the recipe stated at least 45 to 50 minutes and i used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of oats and the recipe was amazing i will definitely be making this again
what a great recipe for family fare been meaning to try these for some time and today amidst middecember runningaround i discovered some plans had changed and i needed to provide a last minute supper whilst still running errands i found i had all the ingredients and they came together and cooked speedily i made exactly to recipe and they tasted great this must rank as a toh classic thanks for sharing and for keeping available for decades for us to enjoy
this is my go to recipe any time i make meatloaf my family loves it
i have been making this recipe for years from an early addition of taste of homemy husband is very picky and this is by far his favorite meatloaf recipei have also made it as large meatloaves and taken it to church potlucks never any left
great recipe
so good and easy to make i have made them several times because i can use gluten free oatmeal we have 3 celiacs in the family i doubled the recipe but made a single recipe of the sauce i like the flavor of the meatloaf to shine through
made as one whole meatloaf after all meatloaf is supposed to be easy loved the sauce very good also made with leftover rice next time because i needed to use it worked out fine
just made these for dinner made them exactly as the recipe states i was really disappointed with them after reading all the great reviews they were bland and the amount of ingredients didn39t seem proportional to one pound of beef out of 3 adults none of us liked it i threw out the leftovers
hasn39t anyone noticed the bake time is different from the total time comment to the directions it is 45 minutes love these
these little gems are so tasty i keep a few without sauce because one of my kids prefers them that way i used ground bison and they are simply delicious a volunteer field editor and i love trying and reviewing recipes this one does not disappoint
these are wonderful my husband agrees they will now be our go to meat loaf recipe just delicious i wouldn39t change a thing
this was excellent the loaves were so tender and the cheese oats and glaze gave them incredible flavor this may just be my new goto meat loaf recipe if you don39t want to make individual loaves you can probably make one large loaf and adjust the cooking time i will definitely make these little loaves again and againvolunteer field editor
my aunt brought these fantastic meat loaves to a family reunion about 15 years ago i have been making them ever since and my family absolutely loves them
love this even my picky eater husband loved it
i have been making this meatloaf since i first saw it in the aprilmay issue back in 1999 i still have the original recipe that i cut out and have now laminated that is how amazing this recipe is when i first met my husband 20 years ago he hated meatloaf i tried many recipes and he literally hated them all until i made this one i have never made any other meatloaf since we first made this recipe it is super easy to make and it turns out perfectly delicious every single time the sauce is absolutely amazing i have never changed a thing and everyone who tries it loves it now that we are in our 4039s we are trying to watch what we eat so i decided to substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and i kept everything else the same perfect it was even more moist than normal beef or turkey this recipe is absolute perfection
i made a few loaves without ketchup for my picky little eaters we loved it thanks for the recipe toh
these little meat loaves are wonderful my wife really loves them
this is a very delicious way to make meat loaf i do not make them individually though i make one large meat loaf sometimes i use mozzarella cheese also
pretty good i didnt add any brown sugar or onions because i didn39t have any and i had to use bread crumbs instead of oats but it was still great
my husband especially enjoys these moist tasty meat loaves i often make these and freeze them when they cool
these are the best just had them last night for dinner the only change because of preference is using a small can of tomato paste instead of ketchup started making these in 2000 when they were in the annual toh book my son would say if he was ever on death row and had to choose his last meal it would be these i promised him i would make them whenever he wanted so he wouldn39t have to commit a crime to have them for dinner
love this meatloaf recipe been making it for years now thanks for sharing the recipe
we have been making cheddar loaves twice a month since the recipe first appeared in 1999 i like to add dry minced onion to the topping and a little worcestershire sometimes i make the loaves around a cube of sharp cheddar instead of grated because some of the grated cheese cooks out
no question about it this is a great meatloaf recipe made according to directions the mini idea made these cute and easy serving in our opinion you could make half the sauce and still be delicious as a volunteer field editor with taste of home i love preparing classic dishes with a new twist
these little meatloaves are tender and tasty the sauce is sweet which my kids love i do wish i could have tasted the cheddar because i love cheese
my daughter said that this was her favorite meatloaf recipe sauce tasted great and i love that this bakes much faster than a whole meatloaf
easy and delish the kids loved them too
this is a wonderful recipe i also added some horseradish for a little zing
quickly became a family favorite i have two tips one replace half of the ketchup in the sauce with your favorite bbq sauce and two double the recipe because there will be no leftovers
this smells fantastic when it is in the oven and it tastes as good as it smells
a family favoritemade at least once a month
a friend brought these over after i had my first baby very good
making this again tonight because it is a favorite at our house the flavor and consistency are great when hot and even better the next day on a sandwich i make my mini loaves bigger than suggested 4 loaves instead of 8 one pound of meat only serves 4 here
my family loved it very easy to make
absolutely love this
my family loves this meal espically if you add bacon yum
omg this is awesome we went glutenfree for medical reasons about two years ago and i have been looking for a good meatloaf recipe ever since i made this with glutenfree quick oats and it was perfect we both loved this
fabulous
just made it tonight excellent
what a great recipe i love the presentation and it helps with portion control we freeze them and pull them out whenever we want meatloaf instead of trying to shape my own loaves i use a 8 loaf miniloaf pan works great it does make a lot of sauce however could probably cut the sauce in 12
quick easy and flavorful
could you tell me if these can be baked in a cupcake pan or mini loaf pan and if so what temp and how longthanks so much
love this recipe gave it to my daughter and she was happy with it also
this has been one of my family favorites since the first time i made it i have made it in loaves as well as in muffin tins
i too make mini meatloaves but i use a small corn bread loaf pan to form them spray the m ini pan an d pack with the meatloaf mixture shake out into the baking pan continue withe the balance of the mixture
i have added a couple extra ingredients to the recipe and won 2nd place in a meatlaof contest at my local grocery store amazingly awesome
was devoured in seconds
first you have to like meatloaf
i thought it was very good just a little too sweet so i39m making it again and cutting down on the brown sugar
wow this recipe was much more than i thought it would be this is the one to try people outstanding
this mini meatloaf recipe is a staple in my household very delicious
so easy to make and taste delicious as well they wont disappoint
we love them i found this recipe in a magazine about 15 years ago and have been cooking it for my family ever since i always double the sauce and serving them with mashed potatoes is a must
we loved these i usually make cheeseburger meatloaf and decided to switch it up with thesegreat idea they are so easy to make and the sauce is amazing definitely a keeper
when i made this recipe for a family gathering i overheard 34these are very very very good meatloaves34 everyone raved about them the addition of milk oats and cheese really extends the meat so i ended up with lots of leftovers
i never cared for meatloaf but i love these they are very moist we usually double all the ingredients except for the sauce and it is perfect
yum loved these
these are the best meat loaves usually i am not a fan
my husband and i loved this recipe it was great will try it with a little bit less of the sauce will definitely make these again
this is the only meatloaf recipe i usesince 1999 it is still the bestmake it into one meatloaf or 4 minisadd worcestershire amp siracha to the sauceall i can say is yummy
needed a little more seasoning added some garlic yum
best meatloaf ever
very good
very good
these truly are amazing we added some jacks seasoning and a little cayenne to the mixture and when done baking put under the broiler for about 5 minutes delicious
i have been making this recipe for years amp it is our favorite meatloaf recipe so moist amp delicious
have been making this recipe for years when i was single i loved being able to make the individual loaves eating what i could and then freezing the other loaves to eat later now i make it for my family all the time a definite winner
this is the main meatloaf that i make i have made changes thoughi39ll top it with barbecue sauce and i also sometimes cook it in my slow cooker high for about 3 hours it is absolutely wonderful
this is very tasty my meatloaf is similar to this except without the cheese so it wasn39t a stretch to think my family would like this especially my 3 year old it39s a winner

this was very tasty the meatloaf i usually make is very similar to this except without the cheese so it wasn39t a stretch to think my family would like this recipe especially my 3 year old of course this is definitely a winner
i have froze these before they thaw in microwave or gravy on stove top or in oven
these moist flavorful meatloaves are a favorite for my family who usually do not prefer meatloaf i also add a few other herbs and spices such as garlic powder basil and thyme this is a favorite at my house
pthis is nice and wonderfulp
so good i used plain breadcrumbs and had no problem with the consistency my husband loved it and our 3 year old chowed down as well served with mashed potatoes for tasty comfort dinner
i39m not a great cooktell me about freezing either cooked or uncooked
i love this recipe so much that i39m not sure if i39ll ever go back to my family39s traditional meatloaf recipe
i always disliked meatloaf but my husband loved it my mother made this for him and i loved it make it all the time great for company
i have never been a meatloaf lover but this recipe changed my mind whole family enjoyed well make again
everyone loved this i put them in a muffin tin for individualized portions easy to freeze
i made this using venison and they were absolutely delicious great recipe
i didn39t have enough ketchup to make the sauce so i used half ketchup and have cocktail sauce made it really zippy i have made it exactly as is and it39s great but the cocktail sauce flavor is really tasty too
three out of four kids liking this recipe is a success in my book i used minced onion because it is what i had on hand very easy and quick to make
always keep a stock in my freezer quick to make add cilantro and try different cheeses it is unbelievable thanks
these are soooo good make them now theresa
i made these today for the first timebut it won39t be the last for sure when my husband tasted these he exclaimed34this recipe is a keeper34 we loved the sweet and tangy sauce thanks for sharing this recipe with the world
these are so easy amp good i have made these many many times
i39ve made these more times than i can count for my family amp for company everyone loves them
so good amp easy i love these amp my family does too
i have used this recipe for years it is the best meatloaf ever
i39ve made this recipe several timesalways great i use 12 the sugar to suit our tastes and have also used ground turkey just as yummy
wow very tasty fast and easly i added little bit more onion i served with rice spooned the meat loaves juice over the rice and steamed vegetables soo gooood
so much flavor i love this recipe definitely one of my favorites
i make this for guests a lot every single time i am asked for the recipe it39s easy and everyone loves it to make one big meatloaf i double and cook for 1 12 hrs i add the sauce in last half hour meatloaf is something not everyone will likethis recipe is the exception love it
entire family loved them
i loved this recipe because it was fast and easy tasted amazing this is a great meal to make if you have a busy schedule my husband loved it and wants me to make it again very soon
i have made this many times and they make a great meal to take to others
this is the only meat loaf my family will eat it39s yumalicious
my husband and i loved this recipe i will definitely make again great leftovers
this is the best meatloaf recipe i39ve ever tried it39s moist and flavorful and the topping is just the best i39ve taught my boyfriend how to make them and we have them with creamy potato sticks you can find that recipe on this website also it39s just one of our favorite meals we have often
made this many times super easy and very yummy there is always too much sauce though i cut it in half
this is the best meat loaf recipe ever whenever i ask my husband what he wants for dinner he always asks for these meatloaves
made these for 2nd time today this time used a grill pan so the excess fat drains off worked great i prefer to saute the onion before adding to mixture not a fan of crunchy onion in meatloaf i ran out of ketchup today so used tomato sauce instead tasted just as good
i used extra lean ground beef and it was rather greasy we didn39t taste any cheddar cheese in the meat loaf so i39m thinking the melting cheese added to the grease in the pan we liked the ketchup mixture but will cut back on the brown sugar next time since it was a little too sweet for our taste
you39ll never want another kind of meatloaf again and it39s easy to make
very good my husband and i arent huge fans of meat loaf but have eaten it once or twice and really liked it we made this to give it a try and loved it the sauce is sweet and so yummy we didnt change the ingredients but changed the way we cooked it we put in all as one loaf into a loaf pan and baked it twice as long
i have made this a few times and we all love it this time i was out of cheddar so i used velveeta cheese it was very goodi also added a envelope of onion soup mix and green pepper
i used ground turkey added some chopped carrots and minced fresh parsley and cut back a little on the brown sugar in the sauce this recipe is super yummy
i have been using this recipe for a long time and everyone just loves it they all ask for the recipe which i am happy to share it39s so easy and sooo good
this is my husband39s favorite it is a regular in our home
this recipe is what my husband and i call 34oh my god good34 we loved it it was by far the best recipe for meatloaf i have ever tried just as little fyi try to use ground beef with the lowest fat content you can find otherwise the splatter and smoke while baking gets a little out of control lol
this is one of my most requested ground beef meals i usually double the glaze because it is so yummy i also double the oats so it makes more definately doesn39t taste like a traditional meatloaf at all more like an indulgent oval 34meatball34 you can39t really taste the cheese it just ads to the richness
this will definitely go in our family favorite cookbook yummy
this is the best meatloaf recipe in the world i love the sauce i39ve made this for many of my friends and they all love it even people who don39t usually like meatloaf
this recipe was not terrible however i do not care to make it again the family did not care for the recipe either
great recipe my husband is not a fan of meatloaf but raves about this recipe i have made it twice in the last month at his request the only change i made was i added ground pork 12 burger 12 ground pork both times and this last time i added chopped green pepper and carrots 5 stars all the way

love these little meat loaves and make them frequently i cut the ketchup to 13c the brown sugar to 18c or less and the mustard to 34tsp makes just enough sauce and cuts down on the sweetness too

to maikoemi after reading your review i thought not doing it when i checked at 25 minutes there were lots of liquid i had to set the oven at 375 for another 25 minutes or more until it was drier i think you did not waited until the liquid evaporated actually it is pretty good and not soft at all

the meat stayed very soft the oats were completely the wrong starch to add and the sauce was sickeningly sweet it couldn39t even be salvaged by being made into a sandwich i can39t believe so many people liked this gross just plain gross

i have been cooking for 60 years and this is the best meatloaf i have ever found it is my husband39s favorite allison columbiana ohio
we loved it making it for the second time because my daughter begged us to make it again
i used a 9oz package of spinach and cheese refrigerated tortellini because that was all they had turned out awesome so much flavor
used hot italian sausage and used all chicken broth no water comes together really quickly but has a lot of great flavor
we love this recipe even my very picky teenage sons gobbles it up i sub one package of frozen spinach 12 oz 12 package of frozen tortellini and use one pound of sweet italian sausage a great soup
this soup was very good i accidentally picked up diced tomatoes but it still very good i will be making this many more times thanks so much for the recipe
this is a easy and delicious soup my family asks for it all the time great for a cold new england day
what a delicious surprise this was easy to make and it was so tasty i39m not a huge fan of cooked spinach but this was very good this is definitely going in my file of favorite soups
guys if you need a fast easy recipe with limited ingredients that you can switch out this is the one it comes out fast and great tasting i substitute swiss chard for spinach grew mountains of it threw in half a bag of frozen tortellini as the fresh only comes 5 oz packages at my store adjust the red pepper flakes as your family likes keeping this one for that need a quick healthy dinner
one of my goto meals and i have been making for many years always a sure fire hit can add more veggies or spices if you39d like sometimes we use the hot spicy sausage gives it more of a kick great recipe
doubled the recipe but used a quart of chicken broth and a bit of extra water used a big package of baby spinach and 2 packages of strongal fresco chicken sausage sweet italian style it was so good strong stronghad a nice rich flavor took it to my mil39s for dinner she made sure we left enough for 3 meals i used an 8 quart crockpot cooked it for about 3 hours on low so very good having for dinner again tonight my husband wants me to make it againstrong
the only change i made was using cooked until browned and caramelized hot italian sausage chopped i only added amount of tortellini we were having that night added fresh tortellini the second time also freezer friendly without the tortellini so simple and so delicious
my boyfriend is a trainer and picky eater this fit the bill for us both
this was so delicious i have made it several times question though could i brown the meat etc and then throw everything in a crockpot on low for 6 hours so it39s ready when i get home thanks
what a delicious and simple soup i cooked it exactly as written and it was perfect we especially liked the of the red pepper flakes definitely a keeper
i really enjoyed this i wanted a quick lunch and made do with things i had on hand i used a smoked sausage cut into chunks frozen tortellini and had to skip the spinach since i didn39t have any it was still really good
i39ve made this soup dozens of times since the recipe was first published and it39s a family favorite i also make it often to bring as a gift meal for new parents people recovering from surgery or illness etc and it is always well received it comes together so fast it39s a great 34i can make this after work34 type of meal absolutely delicious
best soupi always double it my husband is not a soup eater and he requests this soup every two weeks when i make this my mom has to come over thank you for this yummy soup
i make a similar soup but also add zucchini yellow squash and carrots
oh my goodness this came out so good i did switch out the pepper flakes for cayenne since i didn39t have the flakes so yummy unfortunately my kid didn39t like the spinach eye roll cant please everyone
awesome soup great flavor and very flexible for on hand house smelled like italian restaurant and everyone loved we like the kick red pepper flakes adds so we use about 14 teaspoon as a volunteer field editor with taste of home magazine i love great tasting dishes that are easy to customize
new family favorite instead of water add more chicken broth instead of diced tomatoes add diced tomatoes with green chili rotel works well wonderful with fresh bread
my husband said recipe is a i hear that very often from him great taste with a little to the broth will definitely make this again
made this a couple of times very flavorful and filling i love this delicious soup
i made this a couple of months ago and my husband who is not a fan of soup mentioned it tonight and would like to have it again we did not have much leftover when i made it so it was definitely enjoyed by our children too
amy i39d suggest that you just add the frozen tortellini to the soup and let it simmer until the pasta is done it should only take a couple of minutes more than indicated for the refrigerated tortellini alone this has become my husband39s favorite coolweather soup i39ve found that we always have leftovers with just the two of us and the tortellini tastes great in this soup but it absorbs a large amount of the broth after the first day and kind of 34takes over34 i discovered that replacing the tortellini with fresh gnocchi is a fabulous substitution and the gnocchi is much better behaved in the leftover soup
i love this soup a friend passed it to me and so so good if i have frozen tortellini should i cook first or thaw amp add thx submitting this comment for 2nd time because i forgot to click the stars
this soup has so much flavorand we will be making this dish from now on i doubled my recipe and even leftovers were amazing
i cook often so i like easy amp delicious recipes this one was super easy amp has tons of flavor i did use italian sausage instead amp added 4oz of cheese tortellini i will definitely be making this again so happy i tried it
this is very yummy family loved it making it again but wanted to know if you can make ahead or will the tortellini get all mushy
funny thing i saw this recipe less than 2 days after i saw another very similar recipe on another website and it wasn39t what i was looking for at all so i took it as a sign that i should give it a try the other recipe didn39t use any meat but it had carrots amp celery with the onion and it also used zucchini i mixed both ecipes
this is a great recipe we subbed kielbasa sliced thin for the turkey sausageadded two cans white navy beans rinsed and drained well low sodium chicken broth tasty and amazing recipe
1010 simple and delicious i did use hot italian sausage and celery as well turned out great thank you
this soup is beyond amazing it is the best tortellini soup on the planet prepared exactly as written wow
this soup is amazing my husband and i loved the second time i made it i left out the tomato39s and used shredded chicken instead of the sausage amp mozzarella and chicken tortellini instead of just cheese and it is now one of my top favorite meals
this is a great tasting and hearty soup with bursting flavor i like it with a rustic french bread my family loves it
this was great i used spicy italian sausage and sausage tortellini loved it
i make this soup often serve it with rolls and a salad
love this soup
excellent hearty and easy to make i added a 34dash34 of red peppers as directed and it was enough that i will be a bit lighter on my dash next time it doesn39t take much to flavor the soup obviously that is a matter of taste definitely one i will make again
pure comfort food purely perfection i chose all fresh organic ingredients and used spicy chicken sausage i seved this soup with some warm buttered italian bread
wonderful soup very tasty
we love this soup i have made this plenty of times
simple easy and fabulous flavor i made it per the recipe and wouldn39t change a thing it was hearty and flavorful could not stop eating it shared with a friend will put this in the favorites book serving suggestion good warm crusty bread with roasted garlic and a glass of red wine
simple and quick and very tasty i would use regular chicken broth instead of reduced sodium it was good using the reduced sodium broth but just a little better after i added some salt
husband and i love this recipe easy to make
i love this it39s tasty and easy just right for a light meal
absolutely love this it was also actually easy to make no hidden steps in between the other steps to prepare food for cooking used prechopped container of onion and preminced garlic to make this even faster with no chopping made exactly per recipe using sweet italian sausage no swapping out water for more chicken broth and it was perfect if i had made that swap as some readers did it would have been too potent for our taste recipe perfect as is
great recipe that makes a delicious meal and will be on repeat this fall and winter easy skill level and quick per other reviews i used all chicken broth in place of water and added 1 15 oz can great northern beans i had a 16 oz package of tortellini and used it all the liquid was sufficient for that amount and it makes a heartier portion it is perfect as is but next time i am going to add a parmesan rind for extra rustic taste
my picky family loves this soup the only changes arewe use hot italian sausage we also make a double batchalways
we make this almost weekly in our house we love to use it for lunches for the week i try to always have the ingredients on hand but the best thing about this recipe is that you can easily alter it and it39s still good we use wegman39s chicken sausage in various flavors usually mild italian and sundried tomato and basil and if i don39t have fresh garlic garlic powder works fine i also use frozen cut leaf spinach instead of fresh it always turns out great even when i double the recipe
absolutely love this and so easy to make my grocery store only had hot turkey sausage so i opted instead for the precooked jimmie dean sausage crumbles the textures and flavors just go together so well
one of our favorites just as is but being a tweaker i added a can of great northern beansyum
i usually twerk a recipe to my own taste this was perfect as is it will be a staple recipe in our house thank you
i loved this soup soon as i tried it at a lunch i went to so i tried it at home and my husband absolutely loved it too it39s now my go to soup and i just change it up by using different meats such as johnsonville brats sliced then cooked or taken out of the casings amp cooked and i use chicken breasts too
yummy doesn39t freeze well with the tortellini in it
i do not post many reviews but have taken toh magazine since it started an i am a big fan i did want to post this soup recipe because it is delicious when i make a recipe for the 1st time i usually follow it as i did this one with the exception of i used all broth an no water which was 3 cans i could not find turkey links this time so i used johnsonville chicken garlic links an just sliced them up an browned them with the onion i thought this would taste bland without adding other seasonings but i was wrong it tasted great thank you tracy for this gem
my whole family loved this soup such delicious flavor i substituted a large can of tomato soup for the diced tomatoes and used ground sweet italian sausage in place of the turkey sausage i will definitely make this again for my family
this soup was amazing i thought since it had limited ingredients and was a quick soup it would lack in flavor but that was not the case the only thing i did differently was use spicy bulk sausage this one is a keeper
this is my go to soup when asked to bring soup to a function it39s always a hit and i39m asked for the recipe the only change i made was to use a pound of italian sausage or hot italian depending on where it39s going thanks for sharing i love this soup
this was really really good i love soups and i do 95 of all the cooking in the house my wife only realy will eat soups in the winter to me that39s just crazy soups are awesome wife and both kids couldn39t get enough with the kids both 16 arguing about how to split the last bowls worth the changes and additions i made are for the proteins i used 4 boneless chicken thighs diced and browned in pot 2 chicken sausage links with sun dried tomatoes browned in skillet then sliced for the water i used more chicken broth i also added 2 large carrots sliced and a mid to small zucchini halfed length ways and sliced i half the amount of garlic and added salted to taste prob about 12 teaspoon and i added the sausage at the same time as the tortellini
absolutely loved this my mom wouldn39t eat it because of the pasta but too bad for her i made half the recipe since it was just myself to eat it had it for lunch for a few days too but that was okay i used hot pork sausage but i like things hot would definitely make again especially during a winter stormnummy
this is one of our family favorites
everyone in my family loves this soup even the kids who are picky eaters the first time i made this i only had ground turkey sausage on hand so i used that i also use all chicken broth instead of adding water
i absolutely love this recipe it has fantastic flavor and it39s very appealing to look at two changes i made from the original recipe is to use plain ground pork over sausage and i add some cubed butternut squash also not bad if you happen to not have the tortellini because you ran out of the store without grabbing it to use some other type of pasta like farfalle
i absolutely love this soup like many i made a couple of changes to the recipe i used plain ground pork in place of the sausage and often like to add some cubed butternut squash it39s greatedit i have no idea why i made two posts
loved this i used spicy turkey sausage which was really good in this then just added some italian seasoning quick and easy too
a friend recommended this recipe made the soup for the first time my husband is asking for it again within a few days loved it
easy and filling served with garliccheese sticks only change i made was to use turkey meat balls will definitely make again
family favourite i use 5c prepared chicken broth in place of the canned broth and water and spicy italian sausage 3 or 4 links removed from casing and crumbled
i too made my own adjustments i had cooked 12 chicken breast in crock then used frozen spinach so darn good amp easy
this is definitely a family favorite i39ve been making it for over a year but i too have made a few minor changes to it i use a onepound package of regular pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage links then to make up for the lack of italian flavor i added 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning and to save time i also threw in a few handfuls of frozen spinach instead of dealing with fresh spinach like most soups it gets even better after it sits overnightassuming that it lasts that long
super quick easy and delicious i will definitely make this again even my picky 6year old liked it
this is a hearty and wonderfully flavored soup i used spicy italian sausage added 1 chopped green pepper a couple chopped carrots and a cup of corn and some extra broth delish
turkey italian sausage is very bland so i added some fennel seed anise seed and oregano very good especially with my husband39s homemade italian bread i think next time i will use regular italian sausage for better flavor
i used hot italian sausage and added half a cup of heavy cream at the end and it was fantastic got rave reviews from my family
this is a fullbodied soup that makes a great meal with a side of crusty bread i used the hot italian turkey sausage because we like spicy food there was mild not overpowering heat the preparation was quick and easy the result is a delicious homemade soup
i39ve made this soup several times as well but with hot italian sausage great flavor and so easy to make it is amazing definitely a keeper
fantastic recipe i made it and the family loved it it39s a regular on the menu now
i39ve made this soup several times it is amazing so much flavor i only make one change i use hot italian sausage
i made this for a dinner party and served it in sip 39n style bowls i ordered on amazonit was perfect
i made this recipe and everyone raved over it it was absolutely delicious everyone wanted recipe that39s how you really know if they like it or are just being nice my daughter inlaw loved it and she hates soup i however went with the original version and used spicy italian sausage rather than turkey sausage or ground turkey but i39m sure they would also be fine
on this icy cold michigan winter day this hot soup was awesome i used italian chicken sausage cut into chucks in addition to the actual recipe i added some fresh sliced mushrooms fresh sugar snap peas that were in the fridge and about a tablespoon of chicken soup base i posted a picture of my masterpiece online it looked fabulous i only wish some of my friends were closer so they could have tasted the yummyiness too
i made this soup last night and it was so amazing i am sharing it with everyone i know i made a few changes due to lack of reading the recipe fully i used pork italian sausage instead of turkey and let it brown really well i omitted both peppers red pepper because my little tongue doesn39t do well with spice and black because i failed to see it when i read the recipe i used dried basil because my market was out of fresh other than that i made it exactly as the recipe reads even with the water which did not dilute the flavor at all i will make this over and over again i cannot express how good it was
super easy and delicious my daughter keep asking me to make this one again d
i loved this soup great flavor combination and only gets better the next day the addition of sausage makes it a hearty meal all by itself grate some fresh parmesan over the top and it is heaven would definitely make this one again
made a huge pot of this soup for christmas bunco with the girls at someone39s suggestion i cooked it a day ahead to let the flavors blend overnight i used italian sausage like hamburger from the meat department i too omitted the water and added extra chicken broth i39m not fan of spinach so i used escarole lettuce instead it turned bright green and with the italian tomatoes i used the soup had colors of red and green and really looked festive oh and i used whole wheat tortellini i served it with the onion swiss cheese bread ring and that heavenly marinated olive and cheese ring everyone raved about the meal we had christmas cookies for dessert
husband and i loved this i used johnsonville hot39n spicy bratwurst 19 oz forgot the water and chose not to use the parmesan cheese it was absolutely delicious and filling with just the right amount of kickkeeps you coming back for more
great for the holidays
i used mild italian sausage as i can39t get turkey sausage where we live we found it salty and lacking flavour
fantastic satisfying weeknight meal i made it vegetarian using vegetable broth and tofurkey sun dried tomato and basil italian 34sausage34 delicious
perfect there is a reason so many people have given this recipe 5 stars
a favorite for sure made it 3 times so far used tomatoes out of my garden but otherwise followed the recipe delicious
i love this soup i cook the tortellini before adding it to the soup at the end
loved it used hot italian sausage
i only give a 3 star because italian food should not be hoteliminated the red pepper flakes thank you very much otherwise simple easy and good oh ya used home grown tomatoes cooked down
i scrolled past this recipe on the toh site and saw all the great reviews decided to try and wow wonderful flavor easy to throw together and a satisfying meal we used a 34hot34 turkey sausage and loved the kick i can see this being a regular recipe in our fallwinter lineup
delish substitutions made used sweet italian sausage fresh chicken stock chopped tomatoes wbasil sweet italian sausage tortellini creole seasoning instead of pepper added spice and flavor
my husband said this is his new favorite i used two 32 oz cartons of chicken broth and omitted the water johnsonville mild italian sausage frozen spinach thawed and squeezed dry and diced tomatoes with italian seasonings really nice flavor thanks for sharing a great recipe
very good
outstanding need i say more
i made this soup yesterday and loved it it was really quick and easy to make i am sitting at work wishing i would have brought some for lunch
outstanding flavour my whole family loved this soup they told me it39s a 39keeper39 which in my family means it becomes part of our regular rotation of meals
very goodbut forget the turkey sausage and use real pork i also add a little more tortellini just my preferenceand i used stewed tomatoes in place of dicedother than that excellent
we love this soup very filling and delicious
this is so easy and tasty actually better the next day
one of our favorite soups so good
excellent i like to use kale instead of spinach sometimes
this was fabulous
my family loved this
this soup was awesome great flavor and it took me 30 minutes to make and tasted like it simmered for three hours i used only 1 cup of water more chicken broth used diced tomatoes with oregano and onion and fatfreereduced sodium chicken broth to reduce the calories further i also had frozen tortellini so i used those as i think they hold up better than fresh
5 starslove the flavor i used garlic with olive oil diced tomatoes and chicken stock instead of water
i sauteed shredded kale with no stems with the onion and added carrots add garlic after i generally find adding garlic and other potentially harsher arromatics later so they don39t burn is the right call i then added a teaspoon of sweet paprika a bay leaf and two thyme sprigs right before the broth and tomatoes replace water with all broth turned out fantastic for the finer palate a cup of gruyere added really is awesome in lieu of parmesan should note i doubled the recipe as well so all measures reflect that dankness
very good i subtititued escarole for spinachexcellent
love this recipe i did make a couple changes i added carrots when cooking the onions and i used canned tomatoes seasoned with garlic and onion included the juices i also included a bag of frozen green beans before adding the spinach and tortellini my husband does not care for soups generally however he loves this soup definitely a keeper
this is wonderful made a few changes based solely on family preferences halved the garlic used all chicken broth and 14 t dried basil then very low simmer covered for 30 minutes my family likes tri color penne so actually boiled that separately and set up a 34soup bar34 where you could assemble this any way you like pasta spinach ladle soup over cheese a huge keeper thank you
the best soup ever
this soup was amazing even if you are not into this type of soup it is a must try i used red onion spicy sausage instead of the turkey sausage chicken broth instead of water added extra and a carton of fresh cherub cherry tomatoes instead of a can of diced tomatoes enjoy
best soup i39ve ever had
loved it
this turned out well
easy amp yummy my husband loves this soup i39ve changed it up on occasion by substituting fresh green beans for spinach or add both use precooked thawed italian meatballs cut into quarters or roasted cherry tomatoes to add
made with meat tortelli 2nd time and was very good as well instead of sausage
my husband loves this soup i add more broth so that it is not so thick
this was very easy to make if you like it 34soupier34 add a little more broth i made everything as is and the family wants me to cook it again
i made a few changes to this soup to accommodate what i had on hand it was super easy and delicious i39m not a fan of sausage so i omitted that i added sweet peppers to the onion and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth i also didn39t have fresh spinach so i thawed some frozen spinach squeezed it and crumbled that in i would definitely make this again the red pepper flakes gave it a hint of spice and the parmesan cheese on top was a nice finishing touch
this is the most excellent soup that you can make it is quick and easy our family loves it
yum will make again
this is a family favorite i use spicy regular italian sausage
absolutely delicious the parmesan cheese added while the soup is served adds to the flavor the only change i made was to add more chicken broth 67 cups of broth and omitted the water since the tortellini absorbs some of the liquid not enough liquid is left for leftovers if more broth is not added at the start
blandi think jimmy dean original sausage would have been better probably won39t cook again
no wonder this recipe is a contest winner it was delicious very flavorful and hearty i used a total of two 32 oz swanson chicken broth boxes because i thought it needed more broth to match the tortellini and because of other reviewers saying the same thing i was glad i did i did not use the water because of what other reviewers said about replacing it with broth which my bigger boxes of broth took care of i skipped the can of diced tomatoes because i39m not a fan but i can see how they would add to the soup for others the recipe calls for turkey sausage but i used regular italian sausage and it calls for 12 oz but i had 16 oz so i used the whole thing for the refrigerated tortellini i used the tiny cheese raviolettis that buitoni offers i used fresh spinach from one of the 9 oz 34salad34 bags probably used about 7 oz of it and didn39t chop it up and i did two tablespoons of the fresh basil because i love it i used more than a dash of red pepper did a couple of shakes we did put shredded parmesan on top and i highly recommend i served the soup with really good five grain bread and butter and as i write this i wish i was having the meal again tonight because it was amazing
hot italian sausage is the way 2 go and the soup pot was empty a definate keeper
great recipe fast and delicious my 6 year old loves it and he is a tough critic btw i used both sweet and spicy sausage
made it with hot italian sausage loved it it was very tasty and colorful was as good or better than soups served in restaurants
didn39t like it
this is the best easiest soup i39ve ever made no changes are necessary
i used hot sausage and added more sausagepasta than it called for and it turned out great my husband loved it and i love it
this soup is quick easy and delicious all in one i39ve made this many times and my fiance loves it
made this over the weekend and it was deicious
this was good i substituted what i had on hand used a box of frozen spinach and substituted 8 oz of a bagged tortellini used a roasted diced tomato which had some additional seasoning my picky son liked it so i39d say it was a hit
this is one of my favorite soups now used fresh tomatoes and spinach from farmers market when making it the first time and it was delicious tastes just as good maybe better second day
this recipe has become one of my family favorites it makes a great meatless monday dinner i just omit the sausage and add a package of cream cheese cut into cubes 5 minutes before serving allow the cream cheese to melt and stir into the soup for added richness
delicious used sweet basil sausage amp italian seasoned tomatoes
absolutely fabulous this has been in my recipe box for some time finally got to try it tonight it was enjoyed by all thanks so much for sharing this fabulous recipe
fabulous i have meateaters in the family so i cooked the hot italian turkey sausage with a pound of ground turkey when i make this again i39ll add some bitesized chicken to the turkey as well i used crushed italian tomatoes instead of the diced variety next time i will also add the tortellini to each bowl because the leftovers soaked up too much of the liquid you gotta try this recipe
a really awesome soup i love how i can get different flavors from every spoonful i made it with regular sausage because i couldn39t find turkey sausage nor did i care for it that much came out wonderful but i was a little spicy
love love loved it did i mention that i loved it i had been looking for a soup that wasn39t so full of salt healthy yet delicious this was wonderful tasty hearty and very fulfilling the only thing i did differently was add stewed tomatoes instead of diced i like the chunky tomatoes plus it adds more veggies to your meal its cold here now so i am excited to get off and head to the grocery store so that i can make a pot tonight yummy ps if you sprinkle a little parmesan shredded cheese on top its gives it an even better flavor
very filling soup great for a cold winter night i used all chicken stock and eliminated the water also added chopped celery and carrots i made mine in the crockpot and let it simmer while at work just cooked the tortellini and added it and the basil and spinach before serving it tastes great the next day
everytime i serve this to guests they want the recipe i bet we have this once a month for dinner i use italian style chopped tomatoes and it gives it even more flavor great recipe
really enjoyed this soup quick and easy to make too i used spicy sausages to give it some extra spice
this is the only soup my entire family including kids age 7 amp 3 loves i use a pound of ground turkey sausage and season it with a mixture i found at httpwwwfoodcomrecipeturkeybreakfastsausagepatties100408 i also use all chicken broth no water and i double the tortellini very filling easy and delicious
i have made this soup several times and we enjoy it more each time i use bulk italian sausage instead which saves time it is so easy to make and perfect on a cold night with crusty italian bread i also add mushrooms and red and green peppers on top of everything it already calls for and it39s always amazing
used johnsonville hot italian sausage and closer to 9 oz spinach all three of my kids said they39d have liked it to have had more tortellini overall very good though
easy and tasty
every one in family absolutely loves it
amazing soup
my whole family enjoyed this recipe i substituted spinach for mushrooms because that39s what i had on hand and i added a less water than is called for in the recipe this was a quick and easy weeknight meal
love it i made two pots of soup using this recipe yesterday for a family dinner one pot was exactly as written and it was wonderful will definitely make again and again the other pot of soup was for vegetarians so it was meatless i used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and for variety butternut squash ravioli in place of the tortellini what was leftover went for lunch today so it was very good also
excellent a new family favorite
everyone loved loved loved this definitely a keeper
this recipe is truly excellent but i suggest a couple alterations for finicky eaters i used crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes it gives the broth a wonderful red color plus you get the flavor of tomatoes without the texture second i add about 3 medium petitley diced carrots and saute them with the onions and sausage you get an extra veggie serving in there and it adds a pop of color almost too pretty to eat it39s a real hit with everyone i39ve started tripling the recipe and freezing it so i always have some on hand
4 12 stars very good and easy to fix
i made this soup substituting vegetarian sausage for the italian sausage and vegetable broth for the chicken broth and the vegetarians and meat lovers at my house all loved it
amazing one of the best soups i39ve ever made
great recipe i followed it exactly and my family said they would like it often
this recipe is so easy and fast my husband has asked for it several times
the best soup ever i made it for a family gathering and everyone raved about it i added a can of rotel to zip it up a bit
this was so good even my picky family loved it and asked for seconds i used a large chicken broth and decreased the water to only a cup next time i will omit the water and use more broth
this recipe was marvelous even my vegetable shy daughter ate it spinach and all we39re definitely making this one again
this is one of the easiest recipes i39ve ever made but instead of using turkey sausage i used johnsonville three cheese italian style chicken sausages
i only edited one major thing in this recipe and that was the onions my fiance doesn39t like regular onions but will eat green onions if i put them in soup so i used a stalk of green onions chopped in exchange for an onion i also nearly tripled the amount of tortellini and i used three cans of chicken broth instead of the one can chicken broth water i ended up buying a 16 ounce package of italian sausage instead of of taking a part 3 4ounce sausages so other than changing the amount i put in of certain ingredients lol i nearly followed the recipe and it was fantastic i39ll be keeping this recipe for years to come
this is super easy to make ready in no time and delicious everyone i39ve ever served it to has loved it paired with some crusty bread this is a megapleasing lunch or dinner
i doubled this recipe used tricolored tortellinis and ground turkey instead of sausage to add some spicy flavor i used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes wchiles i also added a can of white beans drainedrinsed this is such a hearty delicious soup
wasn39t sure about the recipe when i started out with the first few ingredients but loved the end result i used whole grain tortellini and added some fresh tomato i let the first 6 ingredients simmer for about 1 hour before i added the rest
my family loves this my sister in law even wanted the recipe its a quick easy family pleasing meal
my husband and i made this recipe togetherit was amazing thank you for the post i will definitely be making this recipe again

very yummy doubled this and used home canned tomatoes and thawed swiss chard instead of spinach next day the tortellini39s started falling apart and absorbed a lot of the liquid still very tasty but better the first day
i used precooked turkey sausage breakfast patties chopped instead of the links it was absolutely wonderful it freezes very well tastes just as fresh as the day it39s made i added a dash of cayan pepper instead of the red pepper flakes and doubled up on the tomatoes
i just made this tonight it was a hit great taste easy and healthy

i have made this recipe many many times my family loves it
i just made this soup for dinner and it was very good was fast and easy to make i didn39t use the whole bag of spinach because my family just prefers a little less
this got top ratings from my family particularly my husband i didn39t have any spinach so i used red pepper
i really like the flavors of this soup this is the ideal soup to pair with a salad and breadsticks
the best soup i have ever tasted
doubled this recipe and brought to work should have tripledgone in a flash everyone really enjoyed great soup and hearty too yum
i just did not think it had much flavor
i tried this soup for the first time last week it was delicious i used a seeded jalapino pepper in place of pepper flakes as i had some from my garden i also just used bulk italian sausage i have already shared this recipe with my daughters
i have now made this yummy soup several times my family and coworkers all agree it39s a 34keeper34
a bit too much spinach for my husband and me i think i will substitute some zucchini next time other than that it was easy to prepare and tasty to eat leftovers were even better
delish
great flavor and easy to make i didn39t have any italian sausage so i used country sausage and added italian seasoning and some fennel otherwise i pretty much made it as written and served it with small sandwiches great meal for the fall
awesome i made this for the first time when i got my magazine in the mailand make it probably once a month through the fall and winter everyone that tastes it raves simple and very delicious
i made this recipe as written and it was delicious my husband loved it too and it will definitely be a repeat in my house
my mom gave me this recipe a few years ago she used zucchini instead of spinach i39ve used either one or green beans delcious
added left over chicken cilantro celery and sundried tomatoes delicious no one knew they were eating leftovers i kept the sausages also but used chickenapple sausages
awesome we used 4 regular italian sausage links rather than the 3 italian turkey sausage links suggested also i kept the casings on the sausage much easier
i make this all the time light healthy and delicious
this soup is fantastic major raves reviews and seconds by all made this pot disappear quickly
i love this recipe i have used ground beef or regular italian sausage
everyone enjoyed the soup along with slices of garlic bread i used 1 lb of ground italian pork sausage instead of links otherwise i followed the recipe as is very very good
i actually prepared this recipe with a 28 ounce can of rotel diced tomatoes amp green chilies a 32oz carton of beef broth and a 19 oz bag of frozen cheese totellinidefrosted i added a dash of tabasco instead of the red pepper flakes and used the sweet turkey links as well i am one of those cooks who believes in improvising with ingredients on hand and recipes always seems turned out well for me be creative
made this for guinea pig guests excellent easy and quick this is going in the permanent file
this is the best soup for the italian sausage i use one half johnsonville italian hot and one half johnsonville italian sweet it39s a nice blend and gives the soup a little bite i also add sliced fresh mushrooms took it to a soup and sandwich at church and received several requests for the recipe heidi launer alamogordo nm
this is my husband39s favorite soup
i forgot to mention that i used 2 28 oz cans of hunt39s diced tomatoes for my double batch
my husband and i loved this very much though i admit to making a few changes to suit our tastesi doubled the recipe for a bigger batch and used 10 links of johnsonville spicy italian pork sausage my man likes meat instead of 6 turkey sausage links i sliced the sausage into pieces and added the garlic with the onions and meat from the start instead of waiting i added the dried basil black pepper and red pepper flakes when i added the broth and tomatoes i did not add any water so it would cook longer in the soup and pull more flavors out i used more seasoning than recipe called for and used 2 heaping tsps of dried basil 1 tsp of black pepper and added 34 tsp red pepper to suit our need for heati also added 3 tbs of chicken bouillon and 1 heaping tsp of onion powder because we like our flavors stronger and the tomatoes were a bit too dominant the rest i just followed the recipe and voila going to make this over and over again
loved the soup i will cut back on the water next time just for more flavor i added sliced fresh mushrooms to mine i may try to add pasta next time instead of the tortellini jut to see how it taste
everyone ate it and that is a big deal in my house usually half will like half won39t 3 children 5 adults didn39t have tortellini or ravioli so made due with rotini pasta also omitted red pepper flakes cuz of the kids doubled the recipe of course and served with shredded mozarella didn39t have parm added garlic bread and viola yummy for all
tasted delicious looked beautiful and was easy to make the perfect recipe
everytime i make this recipe for friends and coworkers i am asked for the recipe this recipe rates 6 gold stars
this has become a family favorite easy quick and delicious
very good soup not a huge sausage fan tastes best the first day more sausagey aroma after flavors meld
such a easy quick delicious soup didn39t have any tortellini so i used cheese ravioli my husband loved it
this is a great soup to impress it is very easy and so delicious great with a side of crusty bread be sure to just barely cook the tortellini as they can overcook very quickly
this recipe was so quick to fix and really delicious my family said it39s a keeper
this is one of the best soup recipes i have simple to make and packed full of flavor
this soup is very delicious and very low fat and low calorie
this soup is a snap to make and it received heaps of praise from my motherinlaw when i made it for her the soup is full of scrumptious flavors with just the right amount of heat
the flavor of this is incredible for such few and simple ingredients i will make this many times i used fresh basil and my local grocery only had sweet italian turkey so i was sure to give it a few shakes of red pepper flakes the only thing i changed was i omitted the water we like ours a little thicker and i like to avoid the carbs in the crackers that i typically use for that purpose two thumbs up oh and my eight yr old ate 3 bowls so your kids will like it too
this was so good and healthy and easy it was a little spicy so i left out the papper amp red pepper and used a little less turkey italian sausage the flavor was intense and the parmesan was a nice added touch i will surely make this again
fast and delicious
absolutely fabulous i used 34hot34 turkey sausage i loved the pep this soup had
i made 3 different soups for super bowl and this was the favority by far husband said it was the best soup he ever had
this soup is delicious i will definitely make it again i used loose hot italian sausage that was surprisingly lean because my husband loves spicy food and i left out the pepper flakes next time i will try it with a different sausage just for a change but this recipe is a keeper
i love this recipe to add a little flair to it by adding 4oz of fat free cream cheese and a cap full of mrs dash hot seasoning
this recipe is so simple and absolutely deliciouos my family loved it i will definitely be adding it to my regular recipe rotation
this is the first time i39ve written a reviewbut it is also the first time i39ve felt compelled to this is very tasty for the amount of time and effort that is put into making the recipe very easy to makei don39t even like spinachbut this soup is soooo goodi used sausage mince in place of the italian turkey sausage links as this is what i had on handthis was excellent and i will definitely be making this again well done
my husband and i both agree this was delicious next time i will make a double batch so i can share it with family thank you mmb
i made this last night and doubled the recipe hoping to have leftovers no such luck my family loved this soup and said it39s a keeper
i used some bulk pork sausage that i had on hand but i think i will try it with some bulk turkey italian seasoned sausage to get the benefit of the lower calories we really enjoyed the soup and yes i39ll make it again i served it with my home made artisan bread with rosemary seasoning yum
this is one of our favorite soups my husband and i fight over the leftovers and the kids love the tortellini and they even eat some of the spinachi love that it is good for us too
wow so easy so flavorful it39s on my list to repeat soonomitted the pepper flakes and used hot italian sausage instead like a couple of other posters did
i love this soup it will be one that i will make again and again
this is a great soup i used hot italian sausage and omitted the pepper flakes it was so good i sent the recipe to my son who owns a bistro so he could try it too
i love this soup i didn39t use the sausage but added some left over shredded chicken instead i didn39t precook the tortellini i just let the soup simmer thank you for a great recipe
i love to make soup this one has become one of my family39s favorite
i didn39t change anything except that i buy bulk italian sausage it39s cheaper than links and it has become my family39s absolutely favorite soup i love it because i can make it after work and know it will be a hit i39ve also brought it to friends who need a meal great recipe
i liked this soup i made a couple of small changes i did not add the water and i39m glad that i did i used a lowsodium organic chicken broth i also added about 1 tbsp of tomato paste i used hot turkey sausage so i didn39t need the red pepper i love basil but i chose thyme and oregano as my seasoningthis recipe came together fast and it is very good thanks
amazing flavor for a quick soup
this recipe was enjoyed even by my picky hubby i added a can of cannellini beans rinsed and drained and it was terrific
pgreat recipei used pork italian sausagefrozen spinach and frozen tortellini because that is what i had on hand and it worked just as welli definitely will keep making thisp
thus pie is so yummy
my new favorite summer pie so refreshing
i have made this pie multiple times in the past we loved it so easy and light also
what a great recipe i made one with lime one with strawberry and an orange one for a picnic your recipe is fantastic and so very versatile
i have made this with no changes many times and it never lasts long i also use this recipe but use strawberry jello strawberry yogurt and if i have them on hand fresh strawberries sliced both are great for those warm summer days
to dolores9364 why give one star to something you don39t choose to make if you don39t like the recipe and haven39t made it keep your opinion to yourself
1 important point that was missed the mixed ingredients should be completely cool before folding in the whipped topping actually in my case i let the gelatin mixture completely cool before adding in the cold yogurt that way the whipped topping retains more of its volume i made this and it was very good not as good a real key lime pie but way less calories
the pie shell was too big i39m with danital46 will not make it again
will not make this again it was good but did not get fluffy like the picture and did not get firm when refrigerated maybe because i used regular jello instead of sugar free
while this a traditional key lime pie still a good pie if you are looking for something light and slightly sweet this is it also varied the flavors and made peach and strawberry really good and always gobbled up
this is a very good and easy pie i have also substituted strawberry jello and yogurt and some sliced fresh strawberries for another yummy pie
fyi all you pie fans a key lime is a small seasonal lime a separate fruit from a persian lime only use key lime juice in pies or it39s just a lime pie
please review ingredient list it says a small package of lime jello 3 ounces i think that39s a mistake our small packages are 3 ounces not 3 so i used the complete packageand it tasted delicious note i did not use reduced fat ingredients
this was very good both my daughter and husband loved it i did use regular lime gelatin because i couldn39t find sugar free and i used regular whipped topping very easy to make
excellent light key lime pie easy and quick to make want to try other flavors such as raspberry which someone suggested maybe with a chocolate crumb crust and arranging some fresh raspberries on top
omg this is so good one of the best key lime pies i39ve ever made super easy only took 10 minutes and so versatile you could use numerous jello and yogurt flavors
whoopsi forgot to rate the recipe
i39ve been making this for years amp it is one of my families favorite dessertsexpecially in the summer for a cool refreshing dessert i started making my own greek yogurt a couple of years agoamp i have even used it to make the pies amp use a real lime or lemon to flavor it i also make different flavors using fresh raspberries strawberries amp peaches it39s hard to tell which one my family loves best i do freeze the pieswhich i think makes them even better
delicious
this is delicious but i used plant based whipped topping found at whole foods have tried line but would like to try raspberyt good low sugar dessert
yummy and light i have been making various flavors with this recipe for years we used to go camping and i would take the ingredients then make this to share with our campground friends and it was always a hit
this has been a favorite in my household i use 12 oz 1 amp 12 bars of cream cheese instead of the yogurt not a fan and use an additional 4 oz of cool whip on top i use various jello flavors it is especially good with strawberry jello and 1cup frozen sliced strawberries mixed in the filling i also use the larger 9oz graham cracker crust to fit it all in love how easy this is i always get compliments when serving to others they can39t believe how easy it is to make
great recipe susan i wanted to say that the 03 is correct the sugarfree jello 03 ounces and regular jello is 30 you use the regular
this is a wonderfully easy tasty amp healthy dessert my only comment is that the amount of gelatin is incorrect since it says 34one packet34 i used the smallest size which is 30 oz not 03 oz just a typo when it was posted i39m sure i used the full 3 oz packet and it came out fine
this is an easy wonderful light dessert i have made key lime raspberry and strawberry so far and plan to try more different flavors i used regular gelatin and lowfat greek yogurt and light whipped topping i didn39t add all the whipped topping to the pie so i could put it on the pie along with fresh fruit when i served it delicious
this recipe is for me i followed the directions to the letter and it was fabulous i made a low cholesterol graham cracker crust without butter to go with it we put one of the pies in the freezer and it was a lovely frozen desert
this is a delicious pie i was first introduced to it at a weight watcher meeting it39s a treat for those avoiding sugar
i am diabetic and love this pie i also make it with sugar free orange jello and orange yougart makes a wonderful orange cream pie
loved the crust made it with brown sugar the filling wasn39t very tasty added lime juice which helped a little will add more next time i make it my family loved it as is and ate all of it
love this pie it tastes great and only takes 10 minutes to make sometimes i just make the filling and sprinkle crushed graham crackers over it
love this easy flavorful summer recipe if you are a key lime pie snob obvious from the ingredients that it is not going to be key lime pie however call it creamy lime flavored pie either way mine came out delicious and it is great to serve on a warm summer evening i used chabani key lime flavored yogurt just because i love the flavor of this yogurt by itself stick it in the freezer for about an hour before serving and like eating an ice cream pie yummy
i made it and it tasted great however a package of knox gelatin was needed to make it firm today instead of key lime i made it with strawberries excellent
this pie is super easy you can also change up the flavor just by changing the yogurt
this is absolutely the worst key lime pie i have ever tasted maybe it39s because i am a native floridian but this is terrible no one in my family would eat it and i had to throw it away i made it on a trip to st louis because i couldn39t get key lime juice but it was a waste of time and money disgusting by the way key lime pie is never green if it39s green it39s not the real thing
i added juice from 14 of a large lime at the end and folded that in as well best key lime pie ever
great recipe i have made this pie twice the first time i made as key lime and the second time i used strawberry gelatin and strawberry yogurt and they were both delicious our guests really enjoyed these pies i am thinking of trying orange next so quick and easy
i39ve been making this one for years hard to believe it39s so easy and yet so delicious i use sugar free gelatin and light whipped topping i39ve also made it with lemon gelatin and lemon yogurt sometimes i make it in an 8 x 8 square pan using just some graham cracker crumbs on the bottom instead of a crust to cut down on carbs that way i get 9 servings instead of 8
easy and quick
this was very good i used regular lime gelatin not sugarfree since the sugarfree gelatins always take forever to dissolve completely the pie was very tasty and looked cool and lovely i brought it to a club meeting and it disappeared almost immediately
this was a disaster for me the jello turned into little balls when i whisked in the yogurt the only thing i can think of is that the yogurt was too cold and caused the jello to start to set maybe it would have worked if i had allowed the yogurt to warm up a bit first i had to throw it away
you can make other flavors simply change out the gelatin and the yogurtstrawberry peach lemon etc i39ve been making this for many years it is always a hit
excellent i made this using regular ingredients no sugarfree or fatfree and both hubby and i loved this pie so easy and a great summer recipe next time i plan on using an oreo cookie crust i also plan on trying a lemon version of this pie
my husband just yelled out 34good pie34 guess that means i can make it again will try it in a different flavor maybe orange in a chocolate graham cracker crust hmm that sounds good this is so quick and easy to prepare
follow recipe as written soooo good quick and easy mjanderson
quick and easy
you do not have to use the same flavor jello as the yogurt i really like raspberry yogurt with peach jello for example i usually use an oreo crust with most of my pies just because i like the look and taste and i always add plenty of fruit most of the time i will also use a juice or flavored iced tea in place of the water but that does bring up the sugar count love these pies
great recipe we used carb master yogurt to cut the carbs my daughter is a type 1 diabetic so we gotta watch those anybody knocking this recipe or anything sugar free some people aren39t as fortunate or have no choice with certain things my daughter can still consume sugars etc and to be honest white bread would spike her more then a snicker bar lol contrary to belief
so easy and delicious

i39ve made this many times with different flavors of jello and yogurt even mixing and matching like orange jello and lemon yogurt no one even knows it39s made with sugar free or reduced fatsugar products if you want to reduce the sugar there are low sugar yogurts out there even without aspartamethe one thing i never done yet is put it in a pie crust i never saw the appeal of it in a pie the filling is great as it39s own thing a fluffy cool and flavorful dessert
this recipe is so quick easy amp goodi have tried many flavor variationsraspberry yogurt amp raspberry jellostrawberry yogurt amp strawberry jelloif you garnish it with fresh berries once it sets it looks really fancybut it is so quick amp easy to makeit tasted great in every flavor very light amp fluffy yum oin the future i am going to try coconut yogurt amp pineapple jello pina colada pie
yummy i made two pie39s so simply and so good i39m giving the other one to my sister in law for her family for easter thank you leeann treacher
very nice and very easy can also be modified using different flavors of jello amp yogurt
i39ve made this pie twice so easy to make and they came out flawless and scrumptious my husband loves the recipe and so do ithis is a definite keeper and our families will be enjoying it in the future i followed the recipe but also added a little lime juice to increase the 34tang factor34
i made this pie today and give it a huge thumbs up my husband and i both loved this pie so easy with only 4 ingredients it makes a great last minute dessert i highly recommend this pie as a field editor for taste of home
well this was a big hit with hubby and i made it just as the recipe was printed would definitely make it again and again
this dessert was a fluffy little piece of lime heaven i used regular jello and whipped topping as some other reviewers did this would be a perfect dessert for a summer gathering it just tastes like summer and is so easy
this is a good pie
this recipe is at least 15 years old nothing wrong with that from weight watchers it is very good but i agree with the first reviewer not a fan of cool whip and i39m not a fan of anything that is sugar free there are some funky ingredients in both cool whip and the sugar free jello
i recently came across this recipe and i am so glad i did this key lime pie is absolutely delicious and refreshing i have made it 3 times each time changing it up a little for example even though i use the ingredients it calls for the first time i used 2 containers of light yogurt w some fresh lime juice the second time i used 1 light yogurt and 1 regular yogurt and this third time i used 1 light and 1 regular yogurt and again added fresh squeezed lime juice i tasted it before pouring it into the crust and it was delicious third times a charm it39s just now setting in the refrigerator but i think from now on i will be adding lime juice bc it enhances the flavors and makes it a bit more tangy yum
wonderful i did make my own crust and used i2 the sugar and 2 tsp stevia sweetener yogurt i used plain greek yogurt and put in 12 tsp vanilla stevia to taste and squeezed a fresh lime into it it is to die for i am making it a regular summer treat oh who am i kidding year round treat
i39ve made this for my diabetic husband and sons and everyone loves it i make it with low fat and sugar free ingredients no one at our church pitchin knew it was diet and lowfat
very light and fluffy next time i am going to add cream cheese
loved it i did not have key lime jello so i used unflavored gelatin and substituted lime juice for the water the pie was awesome this will be a repeat at our house
yum this pie reminds me of my childhood and eating ambrosia salad i know our family and friends will enjoy it this year at thanksgiving i used a pillsbury pie crust in place of the graham cracker crust thanks for sharing
my husbandwho doesn39t usually like lowfat foodsloves this pie i love it because it39s delicious and super easy to make
delicious and so easy to make
very good amp easy
absolutely delicious it was so easy to make and turned out just perfect definitely will make this over and over
loved this pie recipe my mom used to make a similar pie called frosty fruit i added drained crushed pineapple and a half cup of pecan pieces to this recipe my husband loved it
easy easy easy light and fluffy and taste great what more could you ask for
this pie was very quick and easy to prepare i39ll definitely make this over and over again such a light lime taste
fyi use caution when you serve this to those who want sugarfree this recipe isn39t check all your ingredients39 labels first before you serve this as sugar free if you used the yoplait yogurt as i did there are 14g of sugar per serving plus the graham cracker crust might have some mine will be for our dinner dessert tonight
i made this for a gettogether along with a couple of other pies it was a hit everyone loved it it39s perfect for a light ending to a big meal
i prepare a dessert bar for the fire dept39s monthly fundraising dinners and i always include a diabeticfriendly dessert i will definitely try this recipe key lime pies go over well with our guests so i know this keylimelike substitute will make our sugarconscious guests very happy i can39t wait to try it with other flavors too this sounds like a winner thanks star rating for all things about it add39l star missing only because i haven39t made it yet
it39s a wonderful pie if you don39t want to make it and miss out on a delicious light dessert simply because it doesn39t use actual key limes then don39t make it but if you do you39re in for a real treat by the way the color doesn39t affect the taste
for those hung up on the color of this piekey lime pie really is not green unless food color is usedkey lime pie is a pale yellow green i intend to make this soonlooks so good and inexpensive and light on the calories and fat the other flavors people have mentioned sounds great too
i have been making for years i39m diabetic and this is one of my go to desserts when i want something light super easy to make
first of all it is called key lime pie because it is using key lime flavored yogurt secondly you can make this pie with cherry jello and cherry yogurt or strawberry jello and strawberry yogurt or whatever compatible flavors you like it is a delicious light pie that everyone seems to enjoy whenever it is served
actually key lime juice is yellow not green and the limes themselves are more a yellow color they39re a lot different than regular limes but that is neither here nor there this is a very simple recipe for a nice treat especially for diabetics i39ve had this and it39s tasty
read the ingredients key lime yogurts enough said
the key lime pie i have ever had was greenlimes are not yellow i have been making my grandmother39s key lime pie for 40 yrs and love the green look and taste this one looks yummyam going to try
lighten up people so its not the real thing its still good
great recipe easier on glucose readings and delicious thanks for sharing with us i don39t care if it is green but for those who do don39t make it this so called sad imitation as amateur cook called it is better than most 34key lime39 pies i have eaten in some of the finest restaurants that not so amateur pastry chefs made
i agree with pjmcbride a key lime pie is not green where is the key lime juice what part of this pie even comes remotely close to a true key lime pie i would never ever ever make this sad imitation
will surely make this one
i love key lime pie and don39t eat it because of my diatbetes so was very excited to see this easy recipe for a lime flavored pie it was simple and very good still can39t eat too much of it but it39s a nice treat i added some lime zest to it for extra flavor definitely make ahead of time so it has time to really firm up before serving giving it a 4 rating only because it isn39t really key lime other than what is in the yogurt
ahhhhh how can you even call this key lime pie no key limes in itkey lime pie is not greenwhat are you thinking
i39ve been making this for a long time and with various flavours always goes down a treat
easy quick and yummy my favorite kind of recipe
it39s a hit this is so easy inexpensive and absolutely delicious made this 3 times this week it39s so popular with friends perfect light dessert for summertime
light low cal and doesn39t taste like it also is a weight watchers recipe
i have made this also with strawberry adding sliced fresh strawberries peach with sliced well drained canned peaches and with orange cream yogurt with well drained mandarin oranges all are veryy light and fantastic
i found this recipe in 2012 for st pat39s day and have made a variety of flavors this and all the variations have been big hits the banana split one is the bestvery well drained crushed pineapple strawberry yogurt and jello with fresh strawberries chopped some coconut too and small pieces of dark chocolate mixed with the cool whip is a great flavor too slice a banana on the bottom and pour all the rest on top in the graham cracker crust decorate with a few sliced strawberries and or coconut
this is a very tasty dessert i have made it for my diabetic sister and my dieting self it39s really good the only thing i did differently was i froze it instead of refridgerating it
i added 1 tablespoon of lime juice to the recipe
very good and summer good
quick and easy very light
made this for my office for st patrick39s day everybody loved it am planning to make again to take in for easterone in peach and one in strawberry super yummy
this was very light and easy to make i make it for work on st pat39s day
very easy to assemble am wondering if other flavors could be easily substituted as well strawberry raspberry seems it would work as long as you have matching yogurtjello39s
i do not like lime flavor typically i love this recipe the sour lime taste blends so well with the sweet graham cracker my family loves it as well cool delicious and easy
very good recipe my husband is a diabetic and he loves it
so easy delicious and light love it
i made this pie for my kids amp they really liked it
this was so great on a hot day i did not put in a crust but in dessert cups i have also made it in peach and i plan on making lemon and raspberry as long as the jello and yogurt match you can make any flavor we love it
this is delicious quick easy and fun to make my grandsons and i have made it several times this summer we also decided to expand the idea we have since made orange pie using orange yogurt and orange jello and lemon pie the same way next week we are going to try cherry we think there is a lot a variety possible with these ingredients
very good also tried with strawberry yogurtjello and orange creme yogurtjello these were a hit for summer
i don39t care if it39s 34fake34 key lime this was a hit with family and guests since it39s so easy to make i plan to keep the ingredients on hand to make it often
i make this recipe for my dad who is diabetic and he loves it you can also get cool whip in sugar free eliminating even more of the sugar i39ve also tried it with different flavors of jello and yogurt and it works great it also tastes great even if you aren39t diabetic
this dessert is definitely simple but it tastes exactly like what it is just yogurt and coolwhip sweetened with jello mix
i got this recipe from my mom awhile ago who makes it for my dad who is diabeticit39s so easy to make and so yummy and it39s not insanely loaded with sugars and calories like most other desserts my boyfriends loves it too so it39s a nice treat for us
this is an easy to make pie that is delicious and low in fat the filling makes a little more than will fit in the crust so i just get out a spoon and eat what39s left in the bowl i have made it several times and my family loves it
this is a perfect summer recipe especially if you use a readymade crust since there39s absolutely no baking involved i love citrus of any kind but lime is my favourite i can see that i39ll be making this again and again over the summer
i have made this recipe several times twice for events i catered and also for my family everyone loves it its so quick and easy but people thing you really fussed
pi have used different jello flavors with matching yogurts on this onepeach is greatp
i actually made this with berry jello and whipped strawberry yougurt everyone that ate it loved it i can39t wait to try this with another flavor
my son loves this pie and asks for it often very easy and no as rich as the cooked i use regular jello
this was awesome light amp fluffy and low calorie i made it for work and even coworkers on a diet ate some
i made this at easter using lime juice instead of water for all my fussy eaters everyone loved it my daughter has since made it using different flavors of jello juice and yogurt and it continues to be a hit a friend put the juice back on the heat after stirring in the jello it quickly dissolved completely i actually added a little lime zest to my pie for extra lime flavor yum
i loved this i used the yoplait thick yogurt i have also paired this with other flavors of yogurt and jello with the same great results
i made this today for st patricks day it is so refreshing light and delicious
this was great the only thing is you can not get lime yogurt here so i mixed rapsberry yogurt with the lime jello and it was a great combo
i love this recipe i tried it with a raspberry gelatin the chocolate and rasperry whips yogurt and added a few raspberries and it was delicious and still super easy
added 12 teaspoons lime juice to bring out the flavor this is a light delicious dessert to serve i have made this dessert now three times this month
this is so good and ez to make i serve it to may grandchildren and they love it and it is good for them
this is a great pie i have made it with several different jello39s and yogurts i really recommend this pie for diabetics and people wanting to lose weight

i have already made this 7 times everyone enjoys this very much

i made this for my husband who is a diabetic and took a piece to my mother it was 3 days old and she loved it
this recipe is a favorite in all flavors i have been making it for years now i seldom put into a pie crust therefore saving even more calories norma
this was easy to make and made a hit at our party on sat i also like that you can change the flavor
i made this last weekit was wonderful my only mistake was to put the jello and hot water into a metal bowl for some reason it did not dissolve well and when i added the yogurt it globbed up but it still tasted fantastic i am sure lemon or strawberry would also be great
i made this wonderful pie with an oreo crustwow this easy and tasty pie is a definite keeper will try different flavors and colors for special dayc
i made this and took it into work everyone loved it it was light creamy delicious and low fat carol
i made this pie for a family st patrick39s day celebration it was quick and easy to make and everyone enjoyed it i used the extra large sized crust and it was still nice and full

i prepared this pie for my family it was easy and quick to prepare everyone loved it and it had a richer taste than the usual 34cool whip34 pie yogurt added was a simple way to add calcium to diet toomwparsons
i made two of them for an office potluck on st patrick39s day i had to leave before the luncheon started i was told they were 34wonderful34 i39ve been thinking of all the flavor combinations of gelatin and yogurt you could make into a pie thanks
i tried this pie last night i was a huge hit i did however use an oreo crust looked pretty and tasted wonderful everyone liked it and the people with health problems were not afraid to eat a big piece it is so easy and hits the spot after a big meal this recipe is a definite keeper lilbit2
i only had one lime yogurt and one lemon yogurtmade it anyway and it was delish made it for a st patty day treat and what a yummy treat it was
a super recipe hubby loved it however even though i heated both the mixing bowl and the measuring cup the boiling water did not dissolve all of the lime gelatin think i will dissolve the gelatin in a small sauce pan next time and then pour it into the mixinf bowl
i made this for our st patty39s potluck and no one even knew it was sugar free and low fat i had 3 people ask for the recipe i may try a different flavor next time peach sounds really good to me
why is it called 34key lime34
i made this pie for st patrick39s day as lime is not my favorite i will make it only for special occasions like st patrick39s day but it was quick and easy however i found that all the jello did not get completely 39folded in39 as there were a few chewy pieces of the jello spread throughout the pie i also found that the crust apparently absorbed some liquid from the filling as it was a little softer than i would have liked maybe that was because i used dream whip instead of cool whip which i did not have on hand and no time to go out and purchase some
this recipe came just in time for irish night at my church i was responsible for desert for 80and this fit the bill perfectly i doubled the recipe and put it on a graham cracker crust in a 9x13 pan i made 6 of them and there was one piece left over it was hit with everyone who attended the event easy to make and very tasty oh i drizzled hershey39s chocolate sauce over the top just to dress it up a bit wish i had taken a picture
this is so easy to put together i have made 3 pies for various occasions within a week39s time and have received compliments each time it was a great st patrick39s day treat thanks for a sweet light way to end a filling meal
we made this on vacation everyone loved it i changed the flavors around and made four different pies lemon strawberry orange and berry they were all very good the men like the lemon and key lime the best they didn39t even know it was a healthy desserthehe i have been recommending this to everyone
i made this key lime pie on st pattys dayi thought i would try making the gelatin with lime juice it was a hiti myself that it was too sourbut guests overruled me
no i have not tried the pie yet but i do plan to do so soon
this was really good i am wanting to try it with strawberry instead of key lime
i am dieting ww39s and this dessert was ideal easy and very good will do again soon
this is a great pie the first time i made it though i did not wait for the gelatin to disolve enough i got great reviews though on my key lime 34flop34 haha
this recipe is great i39ve made it many times for guests i also like to make it using strawberry jello and yogurt also i thought using peach jello and yogurt would be great in the summer when fresh peaches are in season i39ve given the recipe to my sisterinlaw
deliciouslowfat dessert quick and easy to make what39s not to like
getting the jello to dissolve in the hot water was a bit difficultthe church ladies said it was delicious and so did my husband46041
this pie is so yummy i got the recipe several years ago from weight watchers i make it quite oftendonna
the taste was outstanding but it didn34t set that well so i tried it again with two boxes of jello and twothirds of boiling water for the two the second time i used a different flavor which was with two boxes of raspberry jello and two cartons of raspberry yogurt after setting i sliced and froze it what a wonderful summer frozen treat
this pie was delicious i made it for a friend for her birthday and she loved it too very light and refreshing
warm bowl should be used for jello and hot water mix with cold bowl jello does not dissolve as hot water 39cools off39 too quickly
this recipe is very easy and very delicious we also made a raspberry pie but changing the flavor of the jello and flavor of yogurt anybody can do this one
this pie was so easy to make and really good next time i will make it with orange jello and orange yogurt you can use any flavor of jello and yougurt
the same rubbery pieces happened when i made the pie i used black cherry jello my husband39s favorite and cherry vanilla yogurt
made this pie and brought into office went over really well this is so easy to make and so tasty i made a raspberry the next day and i want to make it in strawberry next time using strawberry cool whip
hubby and i really liked this key lime pie easy to make only thing wrong is for some reason i had tiny pieces of rubbery lime jello in the pie even though i mixed it really good any help with that
i made this with a chocolate crumb crusr amp it was a big hit fast easy amp deliciousjab
made this on 31509 my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed this dessert will make it again using other flavors
my pies set up very well i tried it with nosugar red raspberry jello and reduced fat raspberry yogurt it disappeared as fast as the keylime pie
this pie is great can be frozen so i make 2 at a time if you use no sugar yogurt and cool whip you have a delicious dessert a with low low calorie count
my husband and i loved the taste of the pie but the texture was very runny even after refridgerating overnight it was still 34soupy34 and did not hold up when cut it didn39t keep us from grabbing a spoon and devouring it though
i made this to go with our stpaddy39s day supper great hit loved by all the cool lime flavor would go great on a hot summer day very easy and quick to make could easiely be made in several flavors by changing the jello and yogurt flavors will make again often thanx
i love this recipe i made my own graham cracker crustbetter than store bought amp easy to throw together you can definitely pick out the gelatin flavor you like and match a yogurt to it for peach strawberry or any flavor you like most of the ingredients i had on hand
this was quick and easy to make anc very tasty it would be good with any matching jello and yogurt flavor yummy my next one will be raspberry
i made two of these pies last saturday for a lunch gathering i needed something quick well this was just what i needed it is really great everyone loved it i made another one later but changed it all to peach my next one will be strawberry
this pie was so simple to make and tastes so delicious the next time i make it i will try using a different flavor of jello and yogurt

i made this dessert for st patrick39s day i give it an a i did however get the same recipe off the keebler graham cracker pie crust package i39m going to try it with some other flavors this summer
i made this pie with peach gelatin and peach yogurt as my husband loves anything peach flavored i added some sliced peaches too and it turned out to be so delicious it is a wonderful light dessert
this was so easy to make and a wonderful light refreshing lowcal dessert there was no tartness like a regular key lime pie and my whole family grandkids to grandpa enjoyed it jodi c
this was so good and so easy you could easily switch the jello and yogurt flavors to make the pie different
this is so easy and fast to make i will try it with other flavors too
awesome finally found a key lime pie my husband loves thanks
i made this pie boiled the gelatin but wound up having tidbits of gelatin did not mix well with the yogurt but it does need a tad bit more of lime juice i like that it was light and airy will make again but try to boil the gelatin longer maybe
this recipe was extremely easy to make and very tasty i used a chocolate crust instead of a graham cracker crust i will make this again and try it with different gelatins and yogurts strawberry sounds good with fresh strawberries layered in the bottom
i made this key lime pie and it lacked some things wish i had added some lime juice to it and maybe cream cheese or something it just did not have the tangy taste i like in lemon pies
was a bit too fluffyi prefer a more substantial pie but the taste was good
i made this for our bible study adult group and used 1 carton of cheesecake yogart and one vanila then added 1 tbl key lime juice it was wonderful and everyone loved it shared the receipe with all present
wonderful wonderful wonderful and easy yumho
very refreshing and so easy you can make this with different flavors next time i39ll try strawberry
i have been making this for several years i also make it with strawberry
this pie was so easy to make and delicious my family and i loved it it is so light and you feel good about going back for seconds thanks for sharing
i loved it i am going to make two for a spaghetti fund raiser for the youth at our church everyone that had a piece of the pie loved it my husbgand isn39t into yogurt low fat etc he gave it a thumbs up thank you helen
this was greatand you don39t feel terrible getting another piece i plan on making it again with other flavors
i made the orange dreamsicle version and it was great will definitely make this again
i made this over the weekend my husband and i are both diabetic so i used sf jello and sf whipped topping i didn39t put it in a crusti just crushed several graham crackers and spread them on the bottom of pie pan and then poured the topping on it was great re the comment about the pie not setting up i wonder if she put too much water in it you don39t put the two cups like the jello box instructsthis recipe only calls for 14 cup
help i tried this recipe yesterday and it did not set up it had plenty of frig time any suggestions would be great the family loved it anyway only change was used regular jello as i did not have sugar free on hand
weight watchers has put this recipe in their handouts for years i have made it many times amp it has always gone over well you can make it it in many flavors try using peach yogurt amp jello
re fluffy key lime piei also agree excellent recipe have also tried several different flavors our favorite is still the key lime have also done the recipe without the graham cracker crustbarb c
i have made this pie for a couple of years and it is oh so fast and easy i have taken it losts of places and everyone likes it so i share the recipe lots rena
this is a great recipe very easy and oh so good i39ve experimented with other flavors of jello and yogurt and have had wonderful results strawberry jello and strawberry yogurt lemon orange etc
this recipe is wonderful love love love
i always use chocolate crumbs for the crust and a little sprinkly on top instead of cool whip i find carnation milk healthier you freeze the milk until crystals are forming along the sides and then you whip it
i have made this with strawberry jello amp yogurt lemon jello amp yogurtorange jello amp yogurtraspberry jello amp yogurt and peach jello amp yogurt amp they are all delicious
i use only sugar free cool whip it doesn39t taste any different to my husband amp i i am thrilled we have it available as he is a diabetic
i am also a diabetic and this pie sounds wonderful they do make sugar free cool whip in the frozen aisle too which would bring the sugar content down even more
i make this every year for easter i make 34 pies using different yogurt amp jello combinations they look so pretty on the dessert table
this sounds wonderful since i am a diabetic i am always looking for something yummy i love key lime can39t wait to try this
i have made this also and instead of the boiling water i use boiling lime juice
i have made this recipe in the past it is the best and easiest keylime pie recipe ever i have tried lots of keylime pie but nothing comes close to this one
i39ve done a variation on this just jello and key lime yoghurt but this looks even yummier and will be on my 34mustmake34 list for summer desserts thanks
to use real key limes add them to yogert and to juice them use a garlic press works great donita lindamood
this recipe is so easy and delicious i also have used different varieties of jelloyogurts key lime is my favorite but i like the orange dreamcycle also this dessest is so lite you always have room for it
i make this pie all the time and it is wonderful it is low in calories sugar and fat so is a good snack for those of us that have to watch our weight try different jellos and yogurts black cherry is especially yummylkkboyd
for a true key lime flavor use 14 cp of fresh key lime juice in place of the water
pthis is 34easy as pie34 and i have tried it with lemon jello and lemon yogurt it39s light as a cloud and oh so yummyp
fixed this last night for my weekly dinner with my grandsons there was not a drop of it left it was that good
i made this tonight and it have been easier plus it was really delicious this is a keeper as i write this review my husband is getting himself seconds
hello from clarion pa krista in meadville she probably has nothing to do with the actual post and just a blurb about the restaurant let alone the comments section and will never see this i am going to hope she does see it this turned out great i did a few swap outs because teenager i used crushed tomatoes instead of diced i 100 recommend putting soup over your rice or grain of choice i have made a few different versions over the years and found out say kind of the hard way the first time i made it to separate the grain and soup you really store or reheat it well with it added in during cooking i got gloop instead of soup the next day
love this recipe even my husband loves it and he does not like rice this one is a keeper
just made and it is yummy the brown sugar must be one of ingredients that makes it so tasty
this delicious soup like so many other reviewers have said will now be in the dinner rotation even my extremely picky husband enjoyed it
love this recipe it39s my go too my taste of home recipe is from 2012 and calls for 2 quarts of water i substitute 6 cups of beef stock we like a thicker soup a few other tweaks i use 14 cup of uncooked rice and 12 teaspoon of pepper this soup never stays very long in the refrigeratorif it makes it that far you won39t go wrong with this recipe
made this for the second time today followed the original recipe the first time and then today incorporated ideas from some of the reviews and we liked it much better instead of 6 cups of water i used 4 cups of beef cooking stock and 2 cups of water also added 34 cup of onions with the beef and 34 cup of celery and couple teaspoons of garlic when adding the tomato sauce etc lastly i added 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce for flavor and the result was great
sounds delicious could this be frozen
i really liked this soup i found it interesting that the rice needs to be cooked beforehand and cook in the broth while the soup simmers for 30 min but followed the recipe aswritten and give this five stars was a bit sweeter than expected so next time i might decrease the amount of brown sugar
i used 3 cups of chopped green peppers plus 2 red bell peppers served it with cornbread outstanding recipe this is one of those dishes that tastes even better the next day guess what i39m having for dinner tonight gt
this was great added some stuff lots of garlic 2 onions a dash of worcestershire 3 jalapenos diced with a house full of extremely picky eaters they all loved this soup i think it39s a first for me
i do a lot of cooking and have been making this since i first saw it in toh years ago it is my absolute favorite soup in my large repertoire people that tell my they hate bell peppers ask me for this soup when we get together i use green red and yellow i have on hand i do add a little garlic and worcestershire but fine without it very hearty healthy and comforting
this recipe is great but to make it better i used half beef half bulk sausage i also added one onion medium size for a single recipe or a large for a double recipe i used all beef broth instead of water and bouillon and if you are a garlic fanatic like me then add a couple of tablespoons of garlic you can start out with less and add more if you would like last but not least if you feel that you still have enough flavor use about a tablespoon or so of onion soup mix that definitely secured the flavor for me ok alljust my little tweaks oh and you must serve this soup with homemade bread topped with land lakes olive oil and sea salt butter spread delish
use leftover meatloaf it39s really tasty the recipe needs salt about 12 tsp
this recipe gave me a starting point i had a bunch of peppers of many kinds chopped em up used ground turkey i had on hand plus a can of rotel and another of diced tomatoes threw in some clamato juice pretty tasty but i didn39t think it went very well with rice which i kept on the side so i can freeze the soup leftovers when i that it out out i may add chili powder and beans as it39s a good base recipe for chili overall pretty tasty
great recipe love changing the peppers when local produce is in season very tasty and the smell is great thanks
this soup is so good
next time i would use a little more spices i only had half the tomato sauceso added 15oz of tomato with green chilles i also added tbs of worcestershire minced onions and garlic i would also add celery
tasty 34mistake34 we loved i made 12 batch for the 2 of us and accidently used diced tomatoes and green chilies 145 oz can in my pantry right next to diced tomatoes on shelf it gave it just a little more 34kick34 i didn39t add salt and i stir fried about 12 cup of chopped onions with the ground beef it was delicious and my husband really liked it
i have made this soup 6 or 7 times it is so good i have also taught a couple of people how to make it since they loved it when they had it at my house i also used beef broth rather than bouillon and water and also added onion and garlic we also use 2 green peppers and 1 red pepper this is a recipe use for years to come
this soup is absolutely amazing my kids thought it tasted like tacos and enjoyed topping the soup with shredded cheese sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips for a fun fiesta kind of feel
i39m not a big fan of stuffed peppers but i love this soup i make it with ground chicken or turkey brown rice and add more chopped peppers delicious
one of the best soups ever i use beef bullion but used 1 litre of beef broth and 2 cups of water also as others have said added an onion chopped celery garlic a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and a few dashes of hot sauce if your kids like diced tomatoes omit them and add an extra can of tomato sauce
best stuffed pepper soup i have ever had only change i made was adding 4 cups of cooked rice instead of 2
delicious will make again
this soup is yummy and the hubby loved it too i added a large onion two cloves of garlic and a few splashes of worchesire sauce i did not put rice in it will definitely make it again
soooooo yummy
my family enjoyed this
we had an abundance of tomatoes and green peppers in out summer garden so i was able to those fo the diced tomatoes and green pepper i did not use cooked rice but since the soup was simmering i let the rice cook in the soup everyone loved it
beth use the vegan ground meat substitute from the frozen food section of your market you honestly tell the difference i also use vegetable stock instead of beef stock or boullion when i make this for my daughter who is vegan this tip also works for chili too
i don39t eat red meat or pork is there anything i can use to substitute for the beef
my whole family loves this soup easy to put together and the ingredients are probably staples in many kitchens hearty and flavorful great for a cold winter day or a rainy day although we didn39t make any changes initially since we dont like tomatoes we decided to try substituting 15oz of tomato sauce for the 28oz can of undrained diced tomatoes wonderful most people will probably enjoy the recipe just as orginally submitted and it is wonderful thank you for sharing the recipe
made it with and without brown sugar and much better without the sugar in my opinion
this is delicious and even better reheated another keeper i love making homemade soup that39s quick and easy and tasty enough for after work preparation this one fits the bill
really good soup kids don39t like green peppers or tomatoesuse red peppers and run tomatoes through the blender use better than bullion in place of water and a dash of worcestershire sauce
i often rave over my own cooking but this soup is amazing i added a large white onion marjoram and sage reduced the simmer time to 30 total so the veggies stayed crisp best soup ever
this is a keeper made as written except i reduced the sodium using lower sodium tomatoes tomato sauce and bullion very easy to put together and was excellent
another 34go to34 recipe for me i39ve made this a number of times but do not use the rice in the actual soup since it gets mushy for leftovers and i love them instead i just serve the rice separately so each can take the amount they want i learned this from motherinlaw who served her chili this way
love this soup modifications used no salt added beef stock instead of water and bouillon cubes added chopped onion used ground turkey 99 lean and added 1 t worcestershire sauce i will freeze this soup without rice my recipe makes 10 servings uses 12 c cooked rice per serving we are following ww and this equals 4 points
absolutely delicious my husband made this soup for dinner but without the rice for we39re on the keto diet it39s a comeback to recipe
have been trying new recipes found this to be in top 3 easy ingredients always in pantry one pot wonder everyone would place rice in bowls first then sauce over left over rice will be used in another recipe nothing goes to waste mmmm mmmm delish
this soup was delicious i only used 1 lb of hamburger but that was plenty for us i did have a lot leftover so next time i39ll add the rice to each bowl and not to the entire pan of soup it soaked it up and was no longer soup the next day it was easy enough to thin out with more stock but the rice got a little mushy still good and none went to waste
this recipe was great it was quick and easy using ingredients that a lot of people have on hand i cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton i would make this again i added some grated parmesan cheese to mine
wonderful recipe i left off the brown sugar i am diabetic and added a half an onion diced and about a 14 cup celery which are two additional ingredients that i include in my stuffed peppers i cooked it in my crockpot on low for 8 hours i will definitely make this again
this soup is delicious i browned the ground beef and then threw everything but the rice into a crockpot amp cooked on low for 6 hours during the last 1 12 hours i added the cooked rice to the crockpot i had roasted red peppers so i used 1 cup of those amp 1 cup green peppers leftovers are great too even though it is thicker
very easy and delicious i doubled the green peppers and added onion garlic and a little cayenne pepper i add the rice to the soup but put a little rice in the bowls and ladled the soup over the top i served it with some delicious crusty bread my husband and i both loved it this recipe is a keeper
this recipe has been so popular so many great reviews i am happy to finally be adding mine i add much more then what has already been spoken for a greet good satisfying soup one that really matures overnightit has the perfect name it does taste like a stuffed pepper due to some diet restrictions i made the following changes no brown sugar or tomato sauce i used 1 very large fresh tomato i used a packet of beefy onion soup mix and added some better than boullion beef base to the mix i upped the amount of green pepper and used less ground beef and i used no ricethis is all about the beefy taste wrapped around green peppersit was most enjoyabletohvfe
this recipe is excellent my family loved it my husband who is not big on ground meat would have liked a bit less but did love the taste it is very hearty and great with a salad and crusty rolls
amazing growing upstuffed green peppers were my favorite i did not wish i had know there was such a thing as green pepper soup until i was at an upscale restaurant a few months ago and it was one of my choices for soup i tried it and was blown away how good it was it reminded me of my mom39s that night when i got homei searched online to find this v recipe i had all the ingredients so the next day i made it and now it is a monthly dinner plus enough for my lunch the next day i did add a few splashes of worcestershire because that was something i remember my mom putting in her stuffed peppers amp with my eyes closed it was liked eating my mom39s stuffed peppers amazing to put a slice of american cheese on top of each bowl will blow your mind makes it creamy and delicious i am a picky eater so to find this recipe is the best to make it thicker add a little more cooked rice other than that enjoy
we loved this soup i made only 12 of the recipe to make sure that it would be one that i truly like like others i added the white rice to each bowl first then topped it with the soup and mixed it in i wanted to avoid the common complaint that the rice expanded and got gummy as it sat in the refrigerator the only change i would make is add more green pepper and reduce the amount of fluid i cooked this on the stove for a couple of hours adding fluid as needed i used beef broth and a bit of water and only 1 beef bouillon cube
so easyso good
tasty but way too sweet cut the brown sugar by at least half
this soup is a christmas eve tradition in my family i use a 32 oz carton of beef broth instead of boullion amp water and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce amp diced tomatoes since hubby doesn39t like tomato chunks i also use instant brown rice amp add it during the last 10 minutes of cooking hearty amp delicious
so good i used 1 pound each of ground beef and turkey and added some sliced cabbage too definitely a keeper
absolutely the best soup recipe a definite keeper
this soup is awesome my husband raves about it and we especially enjoy it with corn chips
this 34classic comeback34 was republished in the septoct 2017 issue where i saw it for the first time i just happened to have made stuffed green peppers the day before had two leftover so i combined this recipe with my leftovers and it was terrific now i may just make the soup and skip the stuffed green pepper altogether wonderful
very good hardy and quicksand essy use it again five stars
please dont rate recipes if you dont follow the recipe directions make as is and rate it otherwise there is no point to it
my husband begs me to make this awesome soup i did use no salt added tomatoes and sauce and i cut the water to 5 cups andthe second time 5 12 if there is any left over from the first making i put 2 cups in a quart freezer bag for when my husband begs againjim39s wife sharon
this recipe was delicious i used fresh peppers and tomatoes from my garden i emptied the 28oz can of tomato sauce and used that to measure my own diced tomatoes i also used about 1 cup more of cooked rice which made it a little thicker but it was still soup since there39s just two of us the recipe made enough for me to freeze two more dinners great for a cold fall or winter day for sure
a new fave made recipe as is except substituted ground chicken for the beef great the next day too
i made this for the 1st time and definitely not the last time this soup is amazing i doubled it because i share it with family and friends i added fresh chopped garlic and chopped onion i also added 2 envelopes of goya seasoning we slurped it up with some garlic toast and couldn39t stop raving about it as we ate it what a perfect soup for fall and a cold day i will definitely be making this in the winter too thank you taste of home for a most excellent recipe
for those of you who do not want to add brown sugar to the soup try a can of stewed tomatoes the sweetness in that type of product should be just right
delicious as written tastes just like stuffed peppers but much easier to make
this soup was excellent i followed other reviewers39 suggestions and added chopped onion and garlic i didn39t have a 28 ounce can of tomato sauce so i used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes i followed the rest of the recipe as written six cups of water did not make it too thin i measured out 1 quart of the soup without rice into a saucepan and added 12 cup of cooked rice for our meal the recipe says it yields 2 quarts but i got 3 additional quarts without rice to freeze i will add 12 cup of cooked rice to each quart when i prepare it so the rice doesn39t get mushy this will be a regular goto for our wednesday soup night
this soup is awesome i make soups and desserts at a local supper club and i love making this soup i tweak it a bit to my taste and added a few other ingredients definitely a 5 star recipe
i pulled this recipe out of the recent taste of home magazine i was looking for a quick meal to make and i had all the ingredients on hand with some swap outs i used ground turkey instead of beef sauteed a half an onion with it i thought that 6 c of water would be too much so i cut back to 4 c and used 1 whole low sodium beef bouillon cube for the diced tomatoes i used 2 145 oz cans and partially drained them before dumping in the pot i only used about 2 tbsp of the brown sugar and no additional salt instead of rice i served it on top of 39cauliflower rice39 it was a hit i39m giving this a 5 because the flavors are amazing and i39m betting will taste even better tomorrow
this is excellent easy quick and l39m sure it will be even more flavourful tomorrow great make ahead dish i could not bring myself to put sugar in so i didn39t i used home canned tomatoes so 2 32 oz jars i mostly cooked the rice then let it sit and cool awhile so it would not turn to mush and must admit l remembered wrong and added 3 cups of rice also l put a dollop of sour cream on each bowl before the garnish great recipe janet vfe
we loved this didn39t change a thing also made great leftovers
this tastes delicious i make it often and everyone who tries it says it has great flavor it reminds my of my mom39s spanish rice from when i was growing up
this was fantastic i did add some garlic and chopped onion everyone loved it defiantly a keeper
loved itadded onion 2 more cups waterbullion1 more pepperwill be one of my go to meals so easy
i made this recipe incorporating some changes recommended by other reviewers we are just two unless our grown children come so we halved the recipe except for the rice and green peppers added onion amp garlic and sauteed them with the green pepper amp ground meat used beef broth instead of water added the rice right at the end despite the changes i am giving this 5 as the end result is so delicious and it is so easy to make we loved it and the leftovers as wellnext time i will try it without brown sugar and adding some smoked paprika for a little spicier taste
way too much water
this is a winner with my family and our boys39 college roommates i added 1 onion a jalapeo 4 cloves garlic 2 grated carrots amp 1 quart water with beef base because i cook the rice separately it freezes better that way too
i took this to an annual soup and salad lunch my ladies group has every january and it was a hit i only made slight changes as the recipe is written here i added a small chopped onion as i was browning the meat reduced the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons and added one quart of beef broth instead of 2 quarts water and the beef bouillon everything else was the same as the recipe written here i say that because the recipe published in the magazine in 1996 did not call for any water at all why does the website recipe say to add 2quarts of water did the restaurant notify the magazine after it came out that they had forgotten to include it in their recipe when they sent it in or did the toh test kitchen add it if so why i39m not complaining just wondering anyway i will be definitely make this again
i always follow a recipe exactly the first time i make it then make my own changes here is what i changed it was too watery with 2 quarts of water so i used no water and a 46 oz bottle of v8 also instead of all that rice i used half rice and half quinoa instead of beef bouillon granules i used roasted beef base absolutely delicious
soup needs onions and i won39t be using brown sugar as for the rice i always cook it or pasta in a separate pot as was suggested to me by a friend who is a chef when you are ready to serve put rice or pasta in the bottom of bowl and ladle soup over the top no gross soggy rice or pasta ever again
this was wonderful i also halved the recipe as there are only two of us i omitted the brown sugar and added chopped onion as one of the reviewers suggested i39ll definitely make again
make sure you stir occasionally as i didn39t and some of the rice stuck to the bottom of the pan
this recipe is delicious i39d prepared it 111315 this was my adaptation of the recipe one can 8oz sliced mushrooms drained one can 14oz italian diced tomatoes undrained 2 cups instant brown rice cooked 1 large green pepper chopped 1 medium onion finely chopped 1 beef bouillon cube 1 cup water 1 lb ground turkey cooked 1 to 112 tsp salt for taste 12 to 1 tsp pepper for taste 1 cup marinara sauce this soup tasted just like stuffed peppers too it is definitely a keeper recipe delowenstein
i made this exactly as the recipe calls and it made a ton of soup it was delicious i will definitely make this again although next time i will half the recipe or reduce the amount of liquids i didn39t have a problem with mushy rice at all
easy to make and tastes great
i did not use the brown sugar but added 1 whole onion chopped and 12 to 1 teaspoon of garlic powder i also only added 1 quart of water for a thicker soup this is awesome
delicious like others said i added diced onion to the ground beef since we like thicker soup i started out with two cups of water with the option of adding more but it ended up being more than enoughi let it cook down once i removed the lid i used white minute rice and added it in once the soup was done rather than letting it cook the entire time also i only added one tablespoon of brown sugar splenda blend and skipped salt since the beef bouillon made it plenty salty
this soup was delicious the first time it was served however the rice soaked in a lot of the liquid so the second time i served it the taste was great but the texture was mushy i will definitely make it again but won39t plan on leftovers as other reviewers suggested i added chopped onions
great soup to kick off the cold weather today my changes were i added 12 cup finely chopped onion while browning meat then i simmered the peppers alone in olive oil for 10 mins with some basil oregano and the salt amp pepper used 34 cup brown sugar only 1 beef cube amp added 1 can of chicken broth made extra rice for those who like less hearty fare
this soup was very very good
always wanted this recipe easy fast and delicious thanks
very yummy my husband amp my parents really loved it and my dad is very picky nowadays i used 2 pounds of meatloaf mix meat instead of only ground beef cause beef is just so expensive and it was wonderful i also kicked up the spices a little with montreal steak seasoning when browning meat and a little crushed red pepper so good and those of us who wanted added a little texas pete to soup when we ate with grilled cheeses had plenty to freeze too even better reheated will be making a lot
this was very easy i used fresh tomatoes and beef broth instead of can tomatoes and the bouillon it felt like maybe something was missing for our tastes so i added garlic and cayenne pepper it was the little extra something we liked in our soup to take it to the next level i will definitely be making it again
super easy and tastes delicious
ohh my gosh so yummy and easy made tonight for dinner
oh my goshthis is a terrific dump and cook soup we enjoy this soup each and every time i make iteven for company
this will easily become one of my favorite soup recipes it tastes just like stuffed peppers and oh so easy to make not sure why the recipe says that it makes only 2 12 quarts i cut the recipe in half and still had 10 cups of soup
i gave the recipe 5 stars but none of them showed up o
i gave the recipe 5 stars but none of them showed up o
my husband and i loved this i have to say i went through my cabinets and used random cans of tomatoes and sauce one can of tomatoes was garlic the other was with onions and green peppers one of my tomato sauces was italian and the other was plain i also did the minute rice in the last 10 or 15 minutes mine turned out more like stuffed peppers without taking all of the time of boiling and baking i will definitely make this again thank you
delish
great recipe but i did make a couple changes substituted lg carton of beef broth for one of the two quarts of water added a cup of chopped onion and substituted crushed tomatoes for the tomato sauce also simmered it 6070 min
excellent recipe i mixed red yellow and orange with the green pepper for color and a milder flavor i also added an extra pound of ground beef and served it over fresh bowtie pasta if desired on the side to add some substance and stretch the batch to all the enthusiastic consumers
this looks awesome and i love some of the reviews i too thought about 12 c chopped onion and also changed to 1qt water and 1qt chicken stock makes the juices a little richer i love those like me that think to tweak a recipe to maybe make it a little better yum
my husband said that this soup is the best he has ever had i added a half cup of chopped onion when i browned the hamburger and i used minute rice adding it about ten minutes before serving then i sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on to serve it
this soup is delicious i belong to a soup club at work and it was my turn i used two smaller cans of diced tomatoes one with onion and the other with roasted garlic everyone loved it
love this soup making another pot today
have been on the hunt for the best stuffed pepper soup and this is it i used a box of beef broth and no added salt for half of the water and a can of italian tomato sauce also added 34 cup orzo pasta i debated using the brown sugar but don39t be afraidit is delicious
great soup base add garlic add cayenne pepper i used the larger diced tomatoes and it made enough soup to try and freeze love this recipe
i used 3 cans of garlic flavored pasta sauce in place of tomatoe juice i increased water and added 4 peppers added two cans stewed tomatoes 4 cups rice
my hubby loves this more than stuffed peppers he says you get more of everything in 1 bite and it is much easier to eat
great soup for some more flavor use the garlicherb diced tomatoes adds great flavor to it
family loved this soup
tasted great
my husband loves this soup it39s perfect for a cold winter39s night with some crusty bread and butter
this recipe was so good i39m an older senior who needs easier things to make i love stuffed green peppers amp i cook a lot this made it so much easier to get that taste without all the work i put in 12 the brown sugar as i don39t care for sweet food
easy and is very good
this recipe is so very tasty followed the recipe and we all loved it
made this last night and husband loved it that39s enough to make me add this to my recipe collection this is sure to be a regular at our house
i39ve made this recipe for years great stuff also make a great pasta sauce if made a little thicker adjust spices to suit your taste on any given day
so so good we spiced it up by using italian sausage instead of hamburger and made it thick by using 2 cups uncooked rice instead of cooked rice plenty of liquid in the original recipe to allow the rice to cook up well
this is nice
i made this over the weekend and planned on using it for a couple of meals throughout the week my suggestion do not put the rice in until you are ready to eat it i put all the rice in and the next morning it was just a big ball of riceall the liquid absorbed i was very disappointed
i made this several weeks ago with minor changes omitted the brown sugar and added hot paprika i also didn39t add the rice until just shortly before we ate because i don39t like mushy rice there wasn39t a drop left
i found this recipe very bland if i make this again i will add some italian seasoning or basil it was disappointing the way the recipe is written
i39ve made this soup several times and its always a winner in our house i can39t stand green peppers but can tolerate the milder yellow and orange varieities so thats what i use i also use less water to give it a richer taste all in all one of our favorite soups
i made this tonight and everyone loved it it was the perfect taste on this chilly fall day it has so much flavor
woah so how did i not know this soup existed yumi added everything except the bullion cubes and switched out the plain diced tomatoes for rotel instead and added the worcestershire sauce like another review said to and it39s got just the right heat with the rotel you won39t need anymore bon appetit
this is a very yummy and quick soup to make usually have all the stuff on hand my only changes were to brown the beef wthe green peppers and added onions celery and garlic as i just love those flavors in soup and substituted beef broth for the water and bouillon and added 1 extra cup of rice mmmmmmm
this recipe first appeared in the 1997 toh cookbook and it39s been my family39s favorite ever since in fact everyone who has ever tasted it has asked for the recipe
the best i have tasted
we love this soup at this time of year we have an abundance of peppers and tomatoes so when i make it i substitute 3 cups of diced fresh tomatoes in the winter i use canned tomatoes and green and red peppers that i have frozen with great results
i made this last night and declare it a winner i made just a couple small changes first i halved the recipe i omitted the brown sugar and added chopped onions even halved it made a lot of soup this is a delicious soup and i will definitely make it again worth five stars
this soup was wonderful i will make it often i sauteed the peppers a bit before i browned the ground beef and added onion nothing to change the taste it was delicious we all loved it
i would not change a thing marvelous
a big hit with my husband amp sons i used homemade tomato sauce amp fresh chopped tomatoes great way to use up garden produce102014 my sons now call this 34my favorite soup34 i use half the water i usually use stock if i have it on hand to replace the water 12 the sugar i usually use sucanat double the green peppers or any color peppers i have on hand and canned or homemade tomato puree if i have fresh tomatoes i just chop those up to replaced the canned tomatoes or put them in my food processor to puree them in place of the tomato sauce i have used cooked barley instead of rice and all varieties of ricered black jubilee rice brown riceinstead of white rice each pot is always met with rave reviews you can definitely boost the nutrition of this with a few simple changes thank you so much krista muddiman for a soup that i39m sure one day my sons39 wives will request the recipe
despite the 97 degree temperature i made this because of all the peppers from our garden we thought it was a tasty soup i did add onion garlic and worcestershire sauce and substituted beef broth for the water
i came i saw i made i loved it
yummy
this recipe is absolutely awesome the only thing i did different was add 4 envelopes of swanson beef boost this soup is sooooooooo good
absolutely wonderful i wouldn39t change a thing i made it for the first time yesterday and have already shared it with several friends
this is great on any day i had frozen green peppers from my garden and added them very good
i do substitute beef broth and it could use more green peppers but it is yummy on a cold night i think that it39s funny that some folks substitute all of the ingredients is it still the same recipe
excellent that39s enough
i made this for my boyfriend and his kids they loved it and it was my first time trying it along with my three year old son and well lets just say their wasnt any left
wow this was a hit during the latest deep freeze in the northeast i followed suggestions here and added an onion amp minced garlic to the beef used beef stock marinara sauce better than boullion beef base amp diced tomatoes with jalapenos plus an additional cup of peppers brown rice into the bowl when serving because its what i had on hand a nice sprinkle of parmesan cheese is a mustit isn39t stuffed peppers without the cheese my family amp neighbors enjoyed this so muchi may never make traditional stuffed peppers again thank you hosses for the keeper recipehahawell look at that making it again after a storm almost three years exactly to the date yummo house smells crazy good
one of the most delicious soups to make when it39s cold outside so many flavor layers i did use ground turkey added some worcestershire sauce vegetable stock instead of water used honey instead of sugar quinoa instead of rice and used 1 can of italian diced tomatoes and 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes
very good i cooked the hamburger and peppers together and added an onion substituted beef broth for the water and left out the beef bouillon husband a very picky eater agreed that it was very good we ate ours with a little cheese on top
made this for my family and everyone loved it i will definetly make this again
i own a deli and serve soups every day i look for new ideas all the time i saw this recipe tried it and it was a hit i did substitute beef broth because i don39t like water in soups i also added more pepper and rice this is a keeper for plain nuts deli
my husband and i enjoyed this soup i made a few changes to make it smaller since there are just the two of us 1 ground beef 1 can beef broth in place of water and boullion 14 oz diced tomatoes and cooked instant white rice we had in pantry otherwise i made as listed and it was great much thicker the second day and was great with cornbread muffins
i look for hearty soup recipes this one is delicious and fillingi made some modifications to it i used venison sausage instead of beef added 3 cups of rice instead of 2 reduced the pepper and eliminated the salt only used the salt in the beef bouillon cubes served with homemade rye bread big hit
outstandingsome changes i madei browned the ground beef with a diced onioni also used one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with habaneros for a bit of kickand used more rice to make the soup thicker
very good i did make a couple changes though i was worried about the brown sugar since i don39t like meat to have any sweetness to it so i gradually added white sugar and decided 1 t was enough i also added a t of garlic powder as for the rice i added a cup of uncooked instant rice toward the end of cooking time and it was still plenty 34soupy34 oh and i also added a small chopped onion when i browned the burger
i tweaked the recipe a bit i only had 1 lb of ground beef i did not use tomato sauce just the diced tomatoes 28 oz i used only about 3 cups of water and only 18 c of brown sugar i added a diced onion minced garlic about 1 tbsp of worestershire and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce since i reduced the amount of brown sugar i added just a dash of clove instead of rice i added 1 c of barley it was amazing
recipe was very good with the exception of the rice i think it would work better with uncooked long grain rice otherwise the soup is too watery i ended up using 2x the amount of rice called for to make it thicker
marvelous
haven39t made it yet but was wondering if you all used 28 oz of tomatoe sauce
excellent comfort food made simple
loved it it39s an easy and quick way to eat stuffed green peppers hmmmm
great soup let alone from my mom in laws hometown awesome
my family is very pleased with this recipe i did read through the reviews before making and decided to make some adjustments of my own i started off by cooking the green peppers with 1lb of ground beef not 2 which i seasoned with garlic powder onion powder and a little seasoning and kosher salt i also used beef stock instead of water and cut it back to about 465oz 1 32oz box container and one 145oz can instead of 2 quarts my family and i like a thicker consistency with our soups so i added a little at a time making sure it was just right i also used 3c of cooked instant brown rice that39s what i had in the pantry since another review recommended it this soup turned out way better than expected and my so says it39s definitely a keeper i also liked the idea of serving it with bread so i added hawaiian sweet rolls to our meal yummy
i love this soup
my husband who doesn39t like stuffed peppers loved this soup it was an instant favorite from the first bite awesome recipe i didn39t add all the water called for and used half sausage instead of all beef a keeper for sure
update had a ton of leftovers and froze them i39m happy to report this soup freezes and reheats extremely well
this was good but i did add some onion and italian seasoning and salt and pepper diff will make again even thought about adding 12 hamburger and 12 italian sausage
decided to try this recipe after my boyfriend requested stuffed peppers we both thought the leftovers from this recipe would be better for reheating than actual stuffed peppers based on other reviews i added a whole chopped onion amp 3 cloves of garlic to the ground beef as it browned i used 15 quarts of reduced sodium beef broth and brown long grain rice i also reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and added 1 tablespoon of dried basil and 1 teaspoon each of dried rosemary and thyme we topped it with shredded extra sharp cheddar and had crusty french bread on the side it was extremely filling and fairly healthy i used 937 lean ground beef and with the additional spices we found it very flavorful i hope it will reheat well as my freezer is stocked full of it
my sister passed this recipe on to me and it39s delicious i add much less water and reduce the s amp p we like the thicker consistency i serve it with a hearty bread umm umm good
very easy to make and delicious serve with crusty bread
i used 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb sausage i also reduced the salt to 1 tsp it was excellent it really makes a lot will probably have to freeze some my kids even liked it
i try to find recipes that are quick and delicious for my job at an assisted living facility i thought this one looked good tried it out on my family yesterday my husband and i really enjoyed it i will make it for the residents this week thank you
i love this recipe but my problem isn39t the recipe itself but the comment made by the 34submitter34 that leads pple to believe they created this recipe the recipe has been around for a lot longer and there39s a starlite tavern in pa that has one of the first versions of this not this place good either way though and i recommend it
this is a very delicious soup getting ready to make it again
i cut this recipe in half and added a can of tomatoe soup its delicious
i39ve made this recipe for a year and love it then tasted a friends stuffed pepper soup and she added a can of rotel tomatoes that has chillies and about 13 package of taco mix this really adds to the whole recipe
this was great i added celery and onion to the meat while it was browning otherwise i followed the recipe exactly as written i will definitely make this again
made this last night for my husband39s study group of graduate students great recipe easy and made enough for seconds for everyone delicious will make it one of my routine dishes
used red yellow and orange peppers in addition to the green had to leave so after bringing to boil covered turned off the heat came back 25 hours later it was outstandingdefinitely will make again
i made this recipe with some slight variations diced half an onion and saute39d the peppers and onions in a tbsp of extra virgin olive oil for several minutes then i added a clove a fresh garlic minced instead of beef i used ground turkey to cut down on fat and used beef broth instead of water omitting the beef boullion granules came out great and we loved it will make it again
the brown sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness excellent soup
this soup is easy to make and very very tasty as well as filling we loved it and i would make it again
absolutely delicious
this was an awesome soup but i did make a few changes as others didused beef broth added a large onion amp a little garlic to meat when browningalso spiced it up with a palm full of dried basil and a lesser amount of dried rosemary thyme amp marjoramtasted just like the stuffed peppers mom used to make everyone gobbled it up also used sweet red and yellow peppers since some have digestion issues with the green
this recipe was good i used beef broth in place of the water and the boullion and also only used half of the amount called for for a thicker soup the flavor was rather mild and could use some spice but it was good i added velveeta cubes on top that melted over the soup which greatly enhanced the soup makes tasty leftovers too
a great filling soup that39s perfect on a fall or winter evening will definitely make this a regular meal
i have made this recipe for several years if you like stuff bell peppers you will love this taste exactly the same i add an envelope of lipton39s onions soup and about a tablespoon of minced garlic
i only used one pound of hamburger and a little less water it tastes exactly like a stuffed pepper my husband says it39s a keeper very good
very very tasty i substituted 4 boullion cubes for the granules used less tha 14 cup of brown sugar and used 4 tsp kosher salt for the regular salt very easy and quick i took this to a 5 person luncheon and brought home very little everyone asked for the recipe thanks
this really tasted like stuffed peppers without all the fuss i used red and yellow sweet peppers very good
i thought the tomato base tasted on the bland side so like one of the reviewers i added a couple dashes of garlic powder when browning the ground beef which definately zips it up plus i added about 34 dashes of worcestershire sauce and 3 shakes of cayenne pepper to the soup this recipe is easily customizable to your family39s taste buds i will definately add to my recipe file thanks
i followed the instructions as given except i made a topping to make it taste more like my wifes stuffed peppers i used buttered croutons with some grated cheddar cheese it was fantastic thanks jim
this soup was delicous even dh who is not really a soup guy loved it i did make a couple improvements to the original recipe instead of water i used 2 qts beef broth i added one small onion diced i used seasoned pepper instead of regular pepper i used left over rice and added it to the bowls before i ladeled the soup over garnished with a touch of shredded yellow cheese yummy
i made this recipe a few days ago and we are just finishing up the leftovers this soup was great i did make a few changes to it but didn39t do anything unusual i used 1 12 lbs ground beef and added 4 cups of cooked rice to the soup 2 cups of rice wasn39t nearly enough it had too much broth with that small amount i did use beef stock instead of water because water doesn39t 34bring anything to the party34 if you get my meaning the soup was excellent and i will definitely make it again thank you for a wonderfull recipe
i added a small can of whole corn wpeppers and it realy made it great i realy like the system 34taste of home34 has for printing out the recipes you can select the sizecolor pictureif wanted and health info
i have been making this for years i add a big can of tomato juice and lots more peppers to it we love it and have had many requests for the recipe
i would give it a 5 star but it is just a little too watery for our taste i only used 1 lb of hamburger and added extra rice but next time i will cut back a bit on the water
this is the second time i have made this soup and it just gets better both times instead of cooking the rice before adding i put it in raw using brown rice and it makes it get nice and thick
love this souphave made it lots of times and have given recipe to family and friends definately will make again and again
needed a quick and easy meal on a cold rainy evening and this turned out really great
our family loves this recipe we do however replace water with beef broth and green peppers for sweet peppers cook the rice separately it is a nice heart bold soup
this is the best soup we use sweet peppers in place of green peppers and it is to die for
excellent
a great soup for winter
amazing soup i dont even like green peppers and i loved this i like my soups more hearty like a stew so i omitted some of the water and i added extra green peppers i also tried doubling the recipe except the beef because i think 2 pounds is a lot and it turned out fantastic yum
i made this recipe with stew beef cubes instead of ground beef and diced fresh tomatoes in place of the diced canned i cooked the rice separately and added it at the end i would definitely make it again and want to try it with ground beef next time
i was specifically looking for this recipe i used to make it and lost it i throw everything into the crockpot except the ricelet it cook all day then stir in instant rice when i get home itis fantastic
this soup is wonderful everyone who tried it raved it was so good
update to previous review i seasoned the leftovers with just a bit about 1 tsp of garlic powder and it made such a dramatic change it was delicious
use 2 quarts beef stock omit the water and beef bouillon cook rice on the side
this soup was really good i was skeptical but the photograph looked so good i decided to try it it was my first time making it so i followed the recipe next time i make this i will cut back on the amount of water but other than that it was perfect it does actually taste just like stuffed peppers with much less work
this recipe does call for 342 cups cooked long grain rice34 so i don39t know why it would turn out gummy you are supposed to cook the rice before you add it to the soup this is absolutely a wonderful soup even my husband who doesn39t like stuffed peppers or green peppers at all for that matter loves this soup i add a small chopped onion and saute the onion and green pepper when i brown the ground beef drain then add the rest of the ingredients delish
made with ground turkey diced tomatoes with chilies omitted the salt and used 3 cups rice
this soup was just average to me i think that if you like a stuffed pepper soup this is great but i tend to like a more creamy soup i probably won39t make this again
i used a vegetarian meat substitute morningstar farms crumbles instead of ground beef i also used 4 cans of vegetable broth instead of the water and bouillon i did make it with 2 cups of cooked brown rice in the pot the entire time and it was fine great recipe my family loved it
the recipe is good but the rice should be cooked separately or only for 20 minutes it became gummy if recipe is followed need improvement
awesome i used 1 large green pepper and 1 red pepper the flavors were awesome also i used 1 lb ground round 14 lb sweet italian sausage and about 13 lb of left over meatloaf and brown rice definitely a makeagain recipe
this is sooo good my kids don39t like stuffed peppers but they love this i39ve served it in bread bowls made from dough using my bread machine and then baked i don39t cook the rice beforehand i put 1 cup uncooked rice and 2 cups extra water in the last 20 minutes of simmering turns out great i also subbed chicken bouillon for the beef 39cause that39s what i had on hand delicious hearty soup
pyum just needs some extra 34humpf34 to get five starsp
i love this recipe so easy and i usually have all the ingredients on hand i make it several times a year and my family loves it
i made this with lean ground turkey for a healthier version and it was delicious we ate it all week and i39m making it again tonight
i couldn39t find plain diced tomatoes so i used the kind with green chilies in it it was way too spicy i39ll try it again without the chilies and hope it39s not so spicy will definitely make again though
this soup was hearty and wonderful on a cold winter night i did substitute about 4 oz of sausage and used ground round instead of ground beef i also used both green amp red peppers it is a lovely dinner soup
how many cups of batter does this make
this is my goto cake now everyone that i have served it to raved about this cake i use my favorite lavazza coffee for the brewed coffee i substitute canned evaporated milk for the whole milk my favorite frosting is a peanut butter frosting and i use it with this cake i put a few piped swirls of frosting on top and top each swirl with a reeses peanut butter cup
is there a high altitude version of this recipe we love it but have moved to colorado and i cannot get the cake right
i made this for mother39s day desert fabulous everyone loved it moist and really quick to put together the icing is excellent as well not to sweet i put almost a cup of good raspberry jam on the bottom layer and put the icing on the bottom of the top layer shaped them together and it was perfect i decorated the cake with fresh raspberries the leftover cake is now 3 days old and just as delicious as the first day i bake the cake a day ahead and iced in the morning this will be my go to chocolate layer cake
this is the second time i39ve tried to make this cake and it just falls apart this time i put it in for almost 20 mins longer and still completely fell apart it tastes great i39ll give it that my mil swears by this cake but i39m starting to wonder if she actually makes another one it39s really frustrating bc now i39m cakeless for my son39s birthday after the same for father39s day i bake and decorate cakes as a hobby but have never had this experience before maybe cutting the coffee or another liquid in half would work better or a higher temp idk either way i probably won39t be trying again with this recipe
this for chinyere if you are worried about the coffee flavor in the cake you can39t tell it is there if you don39t want the caffeine use decaf yes you can use regular cocoa i used hersheys i made it in a regular cake pan 2 different times and it turned out great cooking time at 325 was 40 45 minutes kick it up a notch with this icing httpswwwsouthernplatecomgrandmapearlsflakychocolateicing be sure to double this icing recipe
i cannot wait to try this but i would rather bake it a bundt pan has anyone tried that
the best chocolate cake and icing ever moist and delicious reminiscent of sara lee cakes of days gone by icing is perfection just sweet enough and super creamy similar to seven minute frosting and easier goodbye buttercream icing
please is there any substitute for the brewed coffee and can l use the normal cocoa powder
i have been making this cake for over 30 years it is the absolute best everyone loves it
delicious have been looking for a cake like this for years icing is amazing thank you
i have been making this cake for 26 years my favorite cake and i love the frosting moist and delicious
cake is tasty but worse icing ever both in taste and texture just threw the whole lot in the bin
this was very good i made it the day before and kept in fridge eating the cake chilled may have made it better i did double the icing recipe and made 3 layers of cake i will definitely make this again for an event better than store bought bday cake
first time to try this recipe it39s easy and i love it
love this recipe
awesome recipe made a few times and always consistent results
an amazing cake not difficult to make and delicious following some of the reviews i used blackdark cocoa for half of the cocoa and made an extra half batch of icing using a bit more vanilla to bump up the icing flavour we found that the icing really complements the cake definitely a make again
this has been my favorite chocolate cake recipe for years now and has been my go to cake recipe my aunt loved the cake so much that she asked me for the recipe and made it for a bridal shower and everyone loved it my cousin also asked for the recipe and entered the cake in a contest at school and won i got this recipe from your magaine years ago
this has been my go to cake whenever i feel the need to bake gonna make full sheet itll be quadruple the recipe cant wait
i just had to make this cake because i was intrigued with the frosting as with other reviewers it did take longer than 30 minutes per recommendations of some of the comments i made 50 more icing than what the recipe calls for this cake is wonderful and the frosting is great
i know different areas cooking time can be different but in oregon it took my 28 inch round cakes 45 minutes to bake
wonderful chocolate cake worth the effort my new favorite chocolate cake it took my cake layers about 40 minutes to cook until they were done in the middle
this moist chocolate cake is excellent and the delicious frosting takes it over the top
its a great recipe my grandmothers was the same minus the icing and i know this because this recipe has been on the back of the hershey39s cocoa can for 3 generations at least lol
best chocolate cake recipe ever
this is the perfect chocolate cake it39s super moist it took 43 minutes to bake not 30 which is no big deal also next time i make it i think i need a little more frosting which was equally awesome ps in the frosting use all butter it39s tasty
best chocolate cake recipe i39ve ever made my family loved it
1 cup whole milk 5 tablespoons allpurpose flour 12 cup butter softened 12 cup shortening 1 cup sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract additional baking cocoa optional
icing ingredients only lists 1 cup milk directions say combine milk and flour how much flour
this icing recipe is my mom39s 34french cream frosting34 exactly and is wonderful not quite as sweet as most but still plenty sweet and ever so smooth can39t wait to make this cake
this recipe is great however if you use only butter 1 cop the frosting is much better whip butter and sugar till light and fluffythen continue as stated
what kind of sugar is used in the frostingconfectioners or regularwould superfine work
i have found my chocolate cake recipe this is exactly what i was looking for rich dense but not heavy great chocolate flavor very moist delicious i used vegetable oil because it39s what i had came out beautiful definitely a keeper
oh my gosh this has been our family39s favorite cake since i first made it when toh debuted in 1993 we have six children amp all of them frequently requested it for birthdays nameday treats halfyear birthdays we celebrate a lot in our family baptismal anniversary days etc our oldest daughter asked me to make it for her wedding reception in oct 2013 the only change i make is to make 1 12 times the amount of frosting amp then use the recipe for the frosting in the toh 296 issue for pastel chocolate cake we call the resulting cake 34rainbow cake34 i don39t change a thing in the recipes
i39m still waiting for my cake to finish baking it39s all giggly in the middle and i need it in an hour and a half for my moms birthday i may be throwing it out and buying one what went wrong
we make this recipe all of the time since i received my first issue of toh it is the requested chocolate cake we do like it with the frosting recipe that comes with it but i have also done it up with chocolate frosting i have reduced the amount of oil to 34 cup and the amount of sugar to about 1 12 cup
i use a very similar frosting recipe that was my mothers however it calls for confectionary sugar instead of granulated white sugar which incorporates much easier and faster with no grittiness you can also easily add more powdered sugar if the frosting isn39t sweet enough for your taste
this has been my goto chocolate cake since it was originally published in 1993 i have made it countless times and it has never failed adding coffee to enhance chocolate is actually a very old trick the unique frosting is also a keeper that i have used on this cake and many others i have never seen frosting using a white sauce paste and granular sugar anywhere else i will say i am glad to have a stand mixer now for the frosting since it takes so long for the granulated sugar to incorporate even if you use fine grain
perfect chocolate cake i have used this recipe many times and refuse to use any other chocolate cake recipe
similar to my moms cake but we used i think quarter cup mayo and no canola oil or coffee and raisins try it not salad dressing real or low fat mayo she preferred hellmans raisins optional ill have to try the coffee
hands down favorite chocolate cake recipe the coffee really helps with the color and flavor i swap out the oil for butter and it gives it a richer and a bit denser taste and texture yum
this is my birthday cake for our whole family it has never failed it is always so moist it does not have a taste in case someone is curious it is not chocolate but just right doubled it before when making my kids multilayered multishaped birthday cakes everyone always complements it i have made the frosting listed in the recipe but have made other frostings instead too mostly because i use shortening i use all of my organic ingredients and follow the recipe exactly someone said the center comes out rawthe recipe does state that the batter will be very liquidy and it is however it does bake thoroughly without adding excessive time i typically average a few extra minutes and perfect it also does freeze great without frosting when making shaped birthday cakes i freeze my cutoff extra pieces as layering and then take them out for a later day sometimes i frost the pieces after removing from the freezer when serving but not always great without it too
the cake was phenomenal my family loved it and when i brought to my bake sale it was the only item that was sold out completely the only thing i added to it was a little more flour because the recipe was a little too liquidy other than that it was an awesome cake
our favorite birthday cake to make so moist and heavy i rarely bakebut this cake always comes out perfect no matter what your 34skill34 baking level is its the best
i am an experienced baker and this cake was less than disappointing the middle was completely raw and sank to the middle so mch so it looked like a giant crater had to throw outand start over i cooked it for so long that the edges were getting burnt dont bake this cake
delicious family loved it
i make this same cake only i use no sugar added applesauceinstead of oilno difference in the tasteis still very moist just a whole lot better for you
hi michelledirection 4 is the beginning step for the icing the flour is there
i have made this frostingicing before and use it in my whoopie piesit is amazing as is the cake
delicious i did use half and half regular cocoa powder and special dark cocoa and it is better the second day great cake
good cake
excellent
there is obviously a typo in this recipe our oven temp is correct we even got out the thermometer just to make usre but it took an hour to cook 2 934 pans and they overflowed 3 cups of liquid oil coffee and milk will not work with only 2 cups of flour i39m with leehigh69 this recipe is missing something like another cup of flour perhaps you don39t notice so much in a larger 13 x 9 pan
i think this is a good starting point but it didn39t have much flavor and we won39t be making this again
hey how can i half this recipe but still use 2 eggs and the rest i would like to half
i have made a wacky choccake for years and this has similar ingredientsbut i question that this recipe has only 2c of flour not 3c likel theacky cakei have not baked this cake because of the flour discrepancyare you sure it is 2c flour for the liquid sugarand cocoa amount it does not seem proportional to the liquids
loved it didn39t make the frosting but it is awesome just like that thank you
love this cake first time i made it i hesitated putting shortening in the frosting but it39s so good very moist and chocolateymy kids always ask me to make it for their birthdays definitely a keeper
reminds me of your grandmother as well specially of her moist cakes
this cake recipe is delicious i used a different recipe for the frosting so can39t comment on the icing provided on here my only complaint is that it sunk a bit in the middle
my favorite cake and frosting perfect every time
gram9 when shortening is listed as an ingredient it39s always solid hope that helps
my aunt gave us this icing recipe 60 years ago i remember she had 34blue hair34 the cake is excellent too in warm weather i use all crisco in the icing also i use my hand mixer to blend the flour amp milk while its cooking no lumps
is the shortening liquid or solid
i39ve been eating this cake for the past 60 years and making it for the past 45 it39s a bit time consuming and the icing takes practice to get just the right consistency for the cooked milkflour icing butit is soooooo worth it this is truly my favorite alltime cake recipe
this is the hershey39s cocoa recipe for the cake and the waldorf astoria recipe for the frosting but regardless of who created it the cake and frosting are delicious together i39ve been making it for around 10 years the coffee adds a really rich flavor to the chocolate cake but doesn39t make it taste like coffee the cake has a very moist crumb also i39m not a huge chocolate fan and i can39t do chocolate frosting on top of chocolate cake so i love the contrast of the vanilla flavored frosting this cake keeps well in the fridge and maintains its moisture nicely
loved the cake and the frosting my mother and i had a similar version only we didn39t use vanilla which is a great extra and shortening was substituted with margarine instead
i loved the cake so moist chocolaty and soft this will be my new go to chocolate cake recipe however we were not fans of the icing it was kindabland and runny not really runny but thinner than i would have liked
i have loved this recipe ever since i found it in the first issue of taste of home the cake is moist and delicious and the icing is superb
does the icing use powdered sugar or granulated sugar
this is the best cake i have ever made my family loves it it is always a hit i did have to cook it longer my oven runs a little bit hot and i usually have to reduce cooking time but with this recipe i cooked for an additional 10 minutes
i love this cake
my husband is famous for making this cake in the icing we use 2 t cornstarch instead of the flour and add 14 12 teaspoon almond extract it is addictive
this is almost the same as a cake i make all the time except there is a lot more oil added some have said there was not enough flavor i always use hershey39s special dark cocoa in mine and it makes a huge difference and the frosting recipe is what i use as a filling inside the cake and use a buttercream on top
loved loved loved this cake i not read the reviews beforehand did not use parchment paper but mine thankfully did not stick i had deep pans also so no overflowing either but i will say cook time was way offit was considerable more but it turned out so yummy very moist cake i will use again but with a differ icing was not a fan of that icing at all
although moist i didn39t find it very flavorful maybe i didn39t measure right
this known as ginny39s chocolate cakeyes instant coffee works or coke worksbuy wondra flour for the icing and use real vanilla
this cake was very moist with a light not very sweet frosting i followed the recipe with the minor suggestion of adding a smidge more cocoa powder for anyone that might find this helpful the cocoa powder was hershey unsweetened for the frosting i used unsalted butter and regular white sugar not confectioners the frosting is enough to generously frost the whole cakei baked in a 9x3 round pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sprayed pam all over the pan baked at 325it did not overflow it baked maybe 451hr i didn39t take the time i also added strawberry filing with a thin layer of frosting in the middle as a personal preference but the cake itself is moist
very easy to make i lined pans with parchment paper as suggested and it still stuck a bit on sides though i liberally greased pans very good cake my dad loved it
this cake look exactly like the display cake and is so light and moist the icing is similar to whip frosting like i love i will definitely make this again and again in the near future
this is the best cake recipe i have found and i have been looking for a long time i first made it for my motherinlaw39s birthday and we were all very happy with the results the next time i baked this cake i flavored the icing with mint extract and i am now in the process of repeating that icing for the cake for christmas i have found the cake for any and all of my chocolate cake needs and desires
this cake has been our go to birthday cake since i found the recipe many years ago in taste of homeit is simply the best and all my family and friends look forward to birthdays so i can make it for them the frosting is so yummy too i have been using a rich european cocoa and this certainly does enhance the flavor and for an additional twist you could use mexican vanilla for the regular vanilla awesome cake i have also made it into cupcakes
i love this cake and the frosting is so light and fluffy it39s like my great grandmothers my middle daughter always wants this for her birthday cake i have found refrigerating the frosting overnight makes it creamier i have added red food coloring so my brother can have his 34special red velvet cake34 he don39t have a clue
i absolutely love this recipe moist and very flavorful 1 question though i am going to make a 12in round cake could anyone tell me how many cups of batter this recipe is i39ve never measured it before with making just 2 9 in round cakes thanks
the cake was delicious i did not make the frosting i made it in 2 9 by 13 pans for a layered birthday cake it was a bit hard to stack but i expected that because i made it in a different pan than intended absolutely delicious though very moist
i just made it then it was delicious love this recipe mmmmm mmmmm d im in australia and substituted copha for the shortening this recipe is amazing d
i just made this cake yesterday ohmygawd yummy i lessened the amount of sugar in the icing and also used powdered sugar instead yummy what a keeper and the cake is moist love it i just wasn39t able to use two baking trayspoured it all in oneand ended up with a volcanic cake haha but taste wiseyummeh httpsinstagramcomp7gg5mkyunjtakenbymissgladysl
i just made this cake but it stuck so bad to the pan it could not be used as a birthday cake warning use parchment paper it tastes great though
i have made this cake time and time again my family loves it and i have shared it with many friends i did adjust the temperature up to 350 from 325 and bake time to 35 minutes i still check the center at 30 minutes but that39s just a habit the frosting is so light and fluffy if you start the first half of the frosting before you begin putting the cake ingredients together it saves time
this chocolate cake is amazing easy moist and nice chocolate flavor you can taste the coffee in the batter but not in the cooled cake it just adds a deeper fuller taste sometime i substitute half the cocoa powder with dark chocolate powder i occasionally try different chocolate cake recipes and even if they are good i always come back to this cake as a reliable delicious go to option i have never tried this frosting recipe
so good
just made the cake it was reallygood
this is our very favorite chocolate cake we have been making it for over 20 years we renamed it suzie q cake because that39s exactly what it tastes like
best and easiest chocolate cake ever however it is not light and airy but rather very dense and heavy fabulous also the icing listed here is extremely heavy and if refrigerated is very thick and almost solid it is better using a different lighter icing
i made this cake for valentine39s birthday cake my family loves it it did stick to pan so will use waxed oaper next time put red food coloring and it was perfect
cake is absolutely awesome prepared according to recipe without modification no issues with batter running over cake pans although one pan came close suggest using deep pans cook time was 35 minutes frosting is a separate subject although it turned out without issues was not runny or grainy and did not have strong flour or shortening tastes i will not make it again the only positive thing i can say about it was that it was not a terribly sweet frosting which i liked i did not like all the fat and hydrogenated oils and will look elsewhere for a frosting recipe to compliment this outstanding cake
this is the second time i39ve made this cake and it came out great both times the cake is very moist and has a smooth chocolate flavor i actually prefer this frosting because it39s not as sweet as most it allows for the chocolate flavor of the cake to stand out after baking it it does tend to stick a little to the bottom of the pan so i might try the parchmentwax paper suggestion next time i didn39t have problems with the baking time both layers were finished in the 2530 minute suggested time
this the the best homemade cake i39ve ever made or eaten moist with great flavormade this twice and it came out perfect both times
i had intended to make a different chocolate cake for an event but realized i didn39t have all the ingredients the day i was going to make it just 2 days prior i had come across this recipe and had all the ingredients on hand i normally would not try a recipe for the first time for something special but i had promised to bring a cake so i went for it i made it in a 9x13inch pan putting waxed paper on the bottom of the pan and using cooking spray before pouring in the batter and baked it for 4045 minutes i used a buttercream frosting that i had already planned on everyone loved this cake there were other desserts there but mine got eaten first i will be making this again
the cake is super moist however the flour and shotening in the icing should be swithed out because it gives the frosting a bad taste the amount of the frosting needs to be decreased because it ran over the cake and everywhere else some of the batter stuck to the bottom of the cake pan perhaps a lining of parchment paper would have been better other than that it was a wonderful cake
before i make this we don39t drink coffee so have none in the house and don39t wish to buy it just for this recipe can someone suggest an alternative how about orange juice water almond milk thank you in advance for your reply
i made this for my grandson39s birthday i did not use this frosting as chocolate frosting was requested it did take a little longer to bake but the awful part was while baking in two 934 pans the batter ran over the top and i had a huge mess in the bottom of the open i would have to have put it in two 834 pans when i make this again i will definitely use a 13 x 9 x 234 pan
one of the easiest moistest best cakes ever i have made it several times with no issues and my mother made it often if you have issues you are not following the instructions exactly and correctly it39s that simple
i read all of these reviews and finally i found one that had the same issues i can not believe no one had issues i used 934 pans the dough over flowed and created a huge mess the pans were greased floured and cooled and the cake stuck to the pans the cake was moist maybe to moist the cooking time was way off i cooked it for an hour and yes my oven39s temp is correct the icinghad an after taste of flour and i still had grit from the sugar after doing patch work on the cake i salvaged it to a degree no i would not recommend this cake to anyone it was a disaster
wonderful made it yesterday i too only used butter for the icing and also curdled a bit but was magic the flavour is amazing what i did add in was some panettone essence to both the cake and icing adds a wonderful flavour will make again
made this today and it was incredibly moist and delicious the frosting was a little curdled in appearance i used all butter and no shortening as others suggested but the flavor was fantastic i always use hershey39s special dark cocoa for a dark chocolate flavor will definitely make again
made this today first time i39ve made a cake from scratch that wasn39t dry it was so easy and quick turned out fantastic changed the icing a bit used all butter and added a bit of cream cheese and cocoa to make a chocolate icing we loved it
is the dry chocolate part the hersheys can unsweetened cocoa
awesome nothing else is needed to be said
usually i make box mix cakes but this cake was delicious and easy enough that i will definitely make again followed recipe exactly cake was moist and delicious the coffee flavor does not come out in the end result if you are worried about that cake cooked in 33 minutes the recipe for the frosting was really nice as well make sure you whisk the flourmilk mixture while its cooking also granulated sugar is the correct sugar to use end result is not grainy at all the end taste of the frosting was light and delicious look was very glossy and shiny frosting was good but the cake is so good on its own you don39t need that much frosting next time will cut frosting recipe in half great recipe
love it the cake and the icing thanks for sharing so we can try it
great cake easy to make i use brewed coffee but instant will work as well you just need the flavor of coffee to intensify the chocolate i had never used this icing before but it was great too thanks for sharing
can39t wait to try this recipe but would like to know if it would work as a sheet cake i gave it 5 starts because of all the tremendous already 5 star ratings it has gotten i would though use all butter instead of using shorting in the icing
love this cake i used to make it years ago i couldn39t find the recipe and then i opened my email and there it was i think one could use instant coffee just make a cup of it then add to recipe
for 34bushbabe34 i have several recipes that call for brewed coffee and all i use is instant just make it like you would for a cup of coffee and add it into the recipe any recipe that calls for 34espresso powder34 i also use the granulated instant but i crush it to make it a powder then i measure
this sounds delicious we only drink instant coffee in our house does anyone know the results if instant was substituted for brewed i39m anxious to try it but don39t want to waste the ingredients and ruin it by using instant coffee has anyone baked this with instant coffee
i39ve been making this cake for over 20 years and everyone loves it the coffee enhances the chocolate flavor peanut butter frosting put it over the top
i have used this wonderful recipe for many years my children and i have won many blue ribbons and best of show using this recipe i often use a chocolate butter cream frosting
have used this recipie for years using all butter or margarine for icing no shortening 5 tbl flour is correct
i can39t help but noticing 5 tbsps of flour for the icing is this an erroralso baking cocoanot sure if i can get it here so can i substitute with the regular cocoa which we mix for tea apart from these 2 enquiries i39m ok and dying to get started
i use a similar recipe for icing but use 1 cup butter instead of the buttershortening mix 4 t flour everything else the same if you beat the butter and sugar well it shouldn39t taste grainy we really like it because it isn39t as sweet as regular buttercream frosting
this year i was in charge of my uncles birthday cake i make chocolate cakes a lot but i have never made such a good one i loved it and so did everyone else even my dad who eats lots of chocolate cake and is picky about what he gets said that this was one of the best he had ever had i have never done this before but i printed out this recipe it is definitely a keeper i cooked it for 28 min and used a different vanilla butter cream frosting recipe and it tuned out fantasticbestcakeever b
this cake sounds wonderful will be trying it sooni wouldn39t think the shortening would make the frosting not taste good because a lot of butter creams are half shortening half butter as in decorating cakes and reading the frosting recipe i would think either sugar would work i do know cheap shortening does not work as well and you don39t want it to be more than a couple of months old but as others have said regarding frosting you really need to beat it good you can almost burn up a hand mixer trying to beat it sometimes thanks for sharing
i made this today and its delicious in fact my whole family likes it i followed the directions exactly baking the cakes in 934 pans they did take about 15 minutes longer to bake than directed but i know that there are oven variations various types of pans etc that would account for the differencefor those hesitant to make this because they don39t like coffee i can promise you the cake doesn39t taste like coffee i39m in my mid 5039s have never in my life had a cup of coffee but still enjoy this cake i was a little hesitant about making this frosting as its different from anything i39ve ever made but it turned out great its not gritty as some said and i like it because its light in texture and not too sweet
baking time way off i39m at 45 minutes and still gooey in the middle
wow this cake was so good i followed all the directions exactly i brought it to work and everyone raved over it one lady i work with who tends to be critical said it was the best chocolate cake she ever ate i loved the icing too great texture and flavor just make sure you whip it well
what an amazing cake usually i do boxed mixes but this was far superior and not much work very moist rich and delicious it was even better the next day i didn39t do the frosting recipe but used canned vanilla frosting a thin layer was all you needed because the cake is so rich on its own
i have never rated a recipe before but this was very very good i followed the recipe as written including the icing and everything turned out great thanks for sharing
extremely moist cake the recipe really does make two 8 inch round cakes plus cupcakes so be prepared i attempted to make the frosting but my shortening was bad i had no idea it went bad i agree though with the wyopink that it tasted waxy next time i would use a cup of butter instead this time i substituted a can of store bought chocolate frosting and my chocaholic loved it that39s all that really matters
this cake is amazing you really must try it do use the coffee as well it doesn39t taste like coffee i made it with regular and decaf and preferred the decaf cake my husband and our 3 boys also loved the flavor this cake is very moist i won39t ever buy another box cake again nowthe frostingnot very good it tasted waxy and like shortening it turned out just as stated but doesn39t compare to buttercream i used this frosting recipe the first time i made the cake and was disappointed in it the second time i made it and used a vanilla meringue buttercream and it was perfect thank you for the wonderful cake recipe
i was very nervous about baking a chocolate cake i have had my share of to drybut not this one it was wonderful the only adjustment i used just a little more then a quarter cup of coco powder the color was just right will bake again very very soon
made this cake today and it was delicious nice and chocolaty i used 8 inch round pans and baked at 325 degrees but had to bake for 45 minutes not 25 minutes as stated in the recipe will definitely make this again
made this recipe this weekend for my motherinlaw39s birthday it was so moist and tasty everyone loved it and asked for more i used cream cheese icing and it was just the right amount of sweet you definitely cannot taste the coffee in it just chocolate yummy chocolate
excellent cake very moist and wonderful flavor i followed the directions exactly and no issues with grainy texture for the frosting this is a keeper for us thanks so much for sharing
this is a delicious cake moist with a rich chocolate taste and a lovely icing i followed the directions and the frosting frothed to wonderful consistency thanks to ms kreitz for sharing it it39s absolutely a keeper
easy as anything i39ve ever baked and awesome i did not use the coffee on second one but my hubby is a big coffee drinker so he prefers to add it
love love love this cake definitely moist and creamy everyone should try this recipe it is easy to make and even if it wasn39t it would be worth the wait
this cake is so delicious the only change i made was to use 12 tsp vanilla plus 12 tsp almond extract since i love almond in chocolate i am not a coffee drinker and did not taste any coffee in this cake i took it to a potluck at church and came home with an empty plate the frosting sounded very familiar as i believe i made it many years ago it was not too sweet at all
delicious and simple for the icing i used granulated sugar and followed directions to a tee using my wire whisk attachment on my mixer to beat for 10 minutes did not turn out grainy at all
i have been making this cake for years with love my dear motherinlaw who has passed on gave it to me with a shower gift before my wedding the whole family giggles when someone shows up with this cakea cousin has been making it since she was a child and she told me it never let her down it39s called 34never fail cake34 in my household the coffee deepens the flavor and the texture is fluffy amp moist but it is not a coffee flavored cake sometimes i ice it with a peanut butter frosting and then stand back and watch people lick amp scrape their plates yeah it39s that good if i have to see one more 1 star rating from a 34reviewer34 that has not attempted the recipewell i39ll just have another piece of cake and laugh this isn39t pinterest or someone39s blog it lowers the rating unnecessarily
this was one of my mom39s mostrequested recipes this is so delicious and the light nottoosweet frosting brings back memories of mom this recipe is a classic and never disappoints
loved the moist chocolate cake recipe the frosting comes out light and sweet i prefer one of those richer frostings so i think i might try a different one maybe even chocolate frosting as well cannot say enough good stuff about this cake that coffee i used was donut shop blend and cooled it before using in the cake delicious
cake is wonderful just as is for the frosting it39s granulated sugar and you must follow the instructions and beat 10 minutes using a whisk attachment if you have one for me it would be better using 1 cup of butter rather than half butter and half shortening as i don39t enjoy the shortening taste but it was definitely a nicer consistency than my mom39s traditional buttercream and i39ll be making this again using all butter
i followed directions exactly and the cake turned out wonderful i had no problems with the frosting i used regular sugar i just made sure i mixed it well before adding milk mixture this recipe is definitely a keeper
confusing frosting recipe cake turned out great but i used regular sugar for frosting and i think it should have been powdered sugar instead it was gritty it did not specify please correct 3 star
this is a wonderful cake i also have made it in a 13 by 9 sheet cake and it is great i wish that all those that rate without trying a recipe would please stop there are forums to ask questions in to understand components in the instructions before rating and this would be helpful to them and eliminate unfair ratings for the recipes
any suggestions for altering this for high altitude
for new bakers if a recipe simply says 34sugar34 it means granulated if powdered or confectioner39s sugar etc is to be used the recipe then specifies accordingly my students did a great job with this cake
i39ve been making this cake for 43 yrs from the old grange cookbook it is the best chocolate cake ever it is so moist and also tastes great with peanut butter icing for those who do not like coffeeit does not have a coffee taste
i need to tell you this is a cooked icing you cook the flour and milk stirring constantly so there is no lumps and bring it to a boil then take it off the stove to cool down put in fridge until cold take white sugar not confectioners and other ingredients and mix until sugar is dissolved then add the flour and milk mixture and beat for 5 mins till it is light and fluffy i have made this icing for years and it is wonderful good luck
coffee makes the chocolate more tasty and you absolutely do not taste any coffee also the recipe says sugar not confectioners to rate a recipe you haven39t tested is indeed poor taste
i have been using this recipe for years ever since it was first published the absolute best cake and frosting you can imagine
i am typically not one to eat chocolate cake but since it is my mother39s favorite i made this recipe for her birthday i made it exactly as listed and it was amazing i have never had any type of cake that was so moist i can39t wait to try the recipe for cupcakes
i have made this cak for over 20 years an it is still a good nw asthe first v trie it everyone a work raves over it
i made this cake for my sister39s birthday and it was excellent since i baked it in a pyrex bowl it took over an hour to bake i was a little worried since i made it half whole wheat and only put in 1 34 c sugar but it turned out super moist and yummy it was fairly dense but really good i didn39t try the frosting though
i made this cake for my mother39s birthday and everyone raved about it it was really moist and the icing was fluffy and tasted like whipped cream i made it in a 9 x 13 and had to increase the baking time to 43 minutes i will definitely be making it again now my family wants the recipe
absolutely delicious very moist great flavor i baked it in a 9x13 and only make half of the frosting called for and it was the perfect amount will make this again
this is my goto chocolate cake i usually do it in a 9x13 or as cupcakes most of the time i make a different frosting or use storebought frosting i like this frosting recipe but it is a little time consuming and i don39t have a stand mixer
very delicious and moist i am not a coffee drinker and you really don39t taste the coffee
the most amazing cake and frosting ever
love i forgot to add oil and the cake was still marvelous this is a keeper
a2thpro you will never taste the coffee i am a cake baker by trade and use it in all chocolate cakes i hate coffee too
have made this for yearsfamily loves it and the frosting is excellent
looks great going to try it
i was wondering if the icing uses granulated or powdered sugar i really want to make this for my dad39s birthday on friday i am trusting the reviews and that i won39t ruin it
excellent cake also delicious with cream cheese frosting
i dislike coffee flavor of any kind could i substitute water i know coffee is supposed to enhance the flavor of chocolate but yucki love chocolate but can39t even take mocha
best cake i ever tasted i made this when it came out in the magazine and thought the icing recipe looked strange it is so light and delicious i have been looking for this recipe ever since i lost it so glad to have found it again
best cake ever
pdid anyone add the 5t of flour to the frosting i39ve never added flour to frosting before and am afraid to try it doesn39t mention flour in the directions very confusingp
best chocolate cake and icing ever however i would 1 12 the icing this cake needs 4045 minutes baking
very good
best cake ever
the cake was moist and delicious the only problems i had was that it took a much longer time to cook because i used one rectangular pan and i had issues getting the lumps of shortening out of the frosting the cake was delicious and you didn39t notice the lumps when the frosting was on the cake so overall amazing will make again
this cake came out as good as everybody said it would i made an 8x8 square cake and twelve cupcakes with the recipe given since i didn39t have round cake pans with the 8x8 cake i poked holes in it and poured chocolate syrup all over the top instead of frosting it was amazing i will definitely be making this cake again
best chocolate cake recipe extremely addicting you have to try it it was gone so quick i made it with chocolate icing next time i39ll have to try the one on the recipe
this is a favorite of mine i can39t believe a scratch cake can be so chocolatey and moist the frosting is not so rich and is great for decorating if a buttercream frosting is your preference check out the one at the cake recipes are the same i lost my magazine and was thrilled to find this online
years ago i obtained this recipe from one of the taste of home magazines that i received on a monthly basis from the first time i baked this cake and made this icing i have never selected another chocolate cake recipe i have used other icings like cream cheese frosting which is also delicious on it i have made this over and over for friends and family and have always been told it is the most wonderful and delicious cake they39ve ever tasted once i made it and took it to a church social and it was chosen to be auctioned off to church members to raise money for the young people it was a lot of fun to see people bidding for it and it sold for a great price as they all knew it was wonderfully delicious i39ve been asked for the recipe by many family members and friends i have never had this recipe to fail when i made it i love it
i made this today for a birthday wanted something different from what i had made before this is an excellent cake received raves from all my family in fact i will be making it again next month for my nephew39s birthday i had seen recipes for this kind of frosting before but had never made it it is a new favorite for my family
i have made this cake countless times and it is absolutely the best chocolate cake i39ve ever had i have never made the icing i usually top it with cream cheese frosting this cake is at its best when you make it a day ahead in order to bring out its delicious moistness
we love this cake i go back to this recipe quite a bit and the icing is so tasty if i had to choose between this and a buttercream i39d choose this one always not so sweet
i thought that the batter was deliciouse but the final product had a flour taste that was not very good the frosting was also disappointing
a very moist cake i put sliced strawberries in between the layers topped it with whole strawberries and drizzled it with chocolatei would prefer a buttercream frosting over this one
this smells so good and taste so good
wow this was more than words can describe fantastic very mosit cake and the icing was super super good
this is the only chocolate cake that i make and have been making it since it first appeared in 1993 it is the best
i read other reviews after i wrote my own two people asked about the unusual icing recipe the answers are yes it uses flour and it uses granulated sugar it does take the 10 minutes to beat the icing did you ever wonder how the filling in a commercial filled cookie or cake like oatmeal cream pies or devil dogs is made make this icing and you will see after i had made this cake with the icing i read a recipe for whoopie pies the filling for them is the same recipe as this icing just a different quantity i recommend you try the icing excellent so you know how much i like this recipe i just spent hours trying to find it on this website because i can39t find the magazine with the recipe this is the chocolate cake
ever since i got the magazine in the mail with this recipe in it this has been my chocolate cake recipe it is the best the frosting is different but a very good different i39ve been using this recipe for nearly 20 years i do not use the coffee however i use water in place of the coffee oh and never use sour milk for the milk it really rose that time what a mess if you forget the sugar you can add it at the end ask me how i know the only time this cake was not the right cake was when i was using a special shape cake pan scooby doo and this cake was too moist for the pan
this cake is so yummy and moist it39s the best chocolate cake i39ve ever made
loved this cake this is my new chocolate cakevery moist very good i was a little worried when it was baking because it formed a wet ring and kind of looked like a doughnut but turned out just fine when done i didn39t use this icing recipe i used a homemade peanut butter icing instead
can someone please tell me if the sugar used in the icing is granulated or powdered i39ve never heard of granulated for icing unless cooked but it doesn39t specify
i love this recipe cake is moist and flavorful i have found though that the baking time is off by about 1015 minutes i have increased baking time accordingly for the icing it calls for 5 tablespoons of flour which is used for thickening the best icing i have ever had you won39t be disappointed
awesome cake this is my most requested cake recipe especially for birthdays
this recipe came with my very first taste of home magazine i had looked and looked at that cake and thought to myself that that cake couldn39t tastes as good as it looked oh mother of pearl i was wrong over the top it is i didn39t think my husband would eat it because he can39t stand coffee and it has coffee in it but i was wrong this is the only chocolate cake they ever ask for suits me it is out of this world fantastic i have made it over and over again it is soooooo wonderful thanks for this recipe
this cake was moist i39ll give it that but as far as taste goes the flavor was very lacking i tasted almost no chocolate and that was after i added more cocoa than it called for i would not make this again to me a chocolate cake should taste more chocolatey than this cake did
this cake is spectacular the best chocolate cake we39ve ever eaten very moist with that 34can39t get enough34 taste no 1 on our list
best ever
i have made this cake ever since it came out in the cookbook back in about 1992 i love it it is failproof if you want it to fill a 13 x 9 full just do one and a half batches of the recipe after it cools slice off the extra it is the best part and then turn the cake out onto the cooling rack
i found this recipe in the premiere edition of taste of home it has been our family39s traditional birthday cake ever since made for every family member taste39s best after it39s been refrigerated beware this cake can be addicting
my family and friends love this cake i saw this recipe when toh first came out almost 20yrs ago i39ve been making this cake ever since i make a lot of cakes but this is the one everyone asks for and there is never any leftoversyum
pexcellent that39s all that needs to be saidp
best chocolate cake ever
this is by far the best chocolate cake ever better than a cake mix
wow was this ever an addicting cake to eat i couldn39t stop eating it i made it for my daughter39s 7th birthday i made cupcakes amp one round cake and doubled the recipe for the frosting because i didn39t want to run out it was perfect
the best chocolate cake recipe i have ever made i use to only make it for special occations but they are far and few so now i make it regularly very moist for days and the frosting isn39t sickly sweet a keeper
i39ve made this special cake for many family birthdays my husband loves the frosting and it looks beautiful on the table
this is the chocolate cake recipe in our house we love it both plain and or with the frosting we like the frosting because it39s not overly sweet as so many frostings tend to be our older son insisted on this cake for every birthday when he was little a surefire winner
ever since receiving the first edition of taste of home i have been making this cake my daughter who is now 28 years old has requested it for every birthday since she was little i don39t even bother looking at other chocolate cake recipes they can39t compete this is the chocolate cake and icing for me and my family delightful
this is the greastest chocolate cake i39ve ever had when i was very young my mom received the premiere issue of toh we made this cake and i39ve been making it ever since
i have made this recipe for family birthday parties since my first issue of taste of home and it turns out everytimemoistchocolately and rave reviews i always use 8 in layer pans and make a half dozen cupcakes for later i noticed that today when i went to make it for my best girlfriend39s birthday lunch tomorrow that i couldn39t find my recipe due to my kitchen under renovationwhen i went on the toh website the cake didn39t turn upso finally at 330 pm found it in a boxand made itturned out perfect once more
so good i had rave reviews after taking to work for a birthday
i have made this cake for years we love it and it is a staple for our birthday cakes i sometimes try other recipes but this is the best
this was the very first recipe i ever made from taste of home and i39ve lost count of how many times i39ve made it since i39ve tied many many chocolate cake recipes and none can compare to this one as a bonus it39s outrageously easy i39ve even baked this in heartshaped layers and decorated it with rolled fondant after icing of course and fondant roses for a valentine39s treat its texture is substantial enough to hold up to the fondantwe like this cake best chilled my husband and i call it 34whoopie pie cake34 as we are from maine and think that it really captures the flavor of those yummy maine treatspersonally i usually do bake it at 350 as i39ve found that at 325 it takes rather a lot longer than 30 minutes but that may be my oven at any rate this is an absolute 34keeper34 recipe
does taste of home not publish negative reviews this cake was a disaster for me today i used 9inch pans and the cake came out over the top and spilled into the oven i followed the recipe to the letter but i think it should have been baked at 350 degrees rather than 325 and perhaps part of the batter should have been used for cupcakes as described if one used the 8inch pans too much batter for 9inch pans
the first day i received the premiere issue with this recipe i baked this cake now it39s my family39s favorite chocolate cake and a must for my husband39s birthday every year
this is the only chocolate cake recipe my family will allow me to use the best
we really enjoyed this cake very moist and the frosting is light i did add 1 cup powdered sugar to sweeten the frosting like another person did and i baked 2 8 inch and 6 cupcakes my cakes ran over the sides of the pans next time i 39ll do 9 inch and cupcakes very yummy
one of the best cakes i have ever made when they say moist they mean it it39s a nice moist rich chocolaty delight a slice of heaven on a plate in my book
this by far my family39s favorite cake adults and kids love it it is like a big 34woopie pie34 it is a nice light bbut moist cake great
we make this cake for my daughter39s birthday on new year day because i didn39t have a box mix this is the best chocolate cake we have ever had better then any box or bakery cake the frosting is perfect and not to sweet i made a double batch of frosting and used all of it on a two layer cake
not a big fan of chocolate cake but this one always makes me go back for seconds
excellent recipe it39s just as moist as a box mix i made the cake with whole wheat flour and couldn39t tell the difference
i have been making this cake for at least 20 years my children now grown have never asked for any other for their birthdaysit was originally in the taste of home magazine
i have been carrying this recipe around since i found it in an issue of the taste of home magazine that is dated 1993 i have shared it with everyone that has asked for a moist chocolate cake and the icing recipe that is with this cake is excellent it is not sweet at all you can actually eat the whole piece of cake without scraping the icing off due to heavy sweetness i truely believe that every cook out there should have a copy of this recipe for it is the bestbarb smith
this cake is deliscous it melts in your mouth the icing is good but i doctored it a little after about 8 minutes of beating i added 1 cup of powdered sugar to sweeten
any tips for high altitude i39m at 7000 feet and my cakes overflowed into my oven then sunk dramatically in the center they taste good but could have turned out a lot better
this cake is fabulous very moist with lots of chocolate flavor the icing is really light and has a wonderful taste not overly sweet definitely a 34keeper34 recipetrish d
i made only the cake portion of this recipe and it is truly spectacular very moist and flavorful not one of those sickeningly sweet cakes i will be using this recipe again
pabsolutely delcious and so easy to make i just made it this afternoon with my kids and it is a huge hit i used the 34vanilla frosting recipe34 from toh because i needed something simple for the kids to help me with thank you so much for sharingp
this cake is the best 34moist34 chocolate cake i39ve ever tasted i have had nothing but praises from all those who have tasted it amp numerous requests for the recipe
this is absolutely the best chocolate cake of all i have made this cake many many times over the years and have yet to find one that could top it very rich and moist
i have made this several times and my wife and i love it recently my wife is on a special diet and has lost a lot of weight because of this diet she cannot use crackers or breadcrumbs her weight loss coach told her to use pork rindschicharones as a binder i used that and it did not affect the taste at all she also cannot use the topping so she has special ketchup that her coach told her to use
pi liked this recipe quite a bit the one thing i would change is the amount of brown sugar i have a real sweet tooth but this seemed like a bit too much sugar to me especially for an entree next time i will likely reduce the amount of brown sugar by half but overall a very good meal loaf p
the best meat loaf recipe the sauce for the top really makes it special i will make it again
try catsup with horseradish family favorite
i used crushed cheezits instead of saltines amp sloppy joe sauce for the top
i usually just use ketchup for the topping too much sugar in one39s diet isn39t very good the recipe is great i give it 3 stars
i think many of us take a recipe and addchange things to make it our own i have never had very good luck making meatloaf it was either way too dense or it would fall apart this recipe is absolutely fantastic i did however addchange a couple of things a while back i ordered 34tomato powder34 from the spice house i always forget that i have it but i saw it in the refrigerator keeps it from getting hard as a rock and figured i39d add it in to the ground beef i used about a tablespoon i suppose you could always use a couple of tablespoons of the double concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube i also used mostly 9010 ground beef but figured i39d add some 8020 in for some extra moisture and obviously more fat my mom always used ritz crackers for meatloaf or meatballsso i combined ritz crackers and saltinesnot really sure it made a difference then i added about one or two teaspoons of kitchen bouquet to the mixture i39m not sure if my changes made any difference at all from the original recipe but this was absolutely the best meatloaf i have ever eaten my 29 year old son asked me if it was any good and i told him to taste it and let me know he called from the kitchen and said 34dad this is the best meatloaf what the world did you put in this34
almost all meatloaf recipes lack one thing that will take it to the next level that is one medium grated carrot
this recipe reminds me of my so moist and seasoned so well i just finished the last bite thank you for this delicious ness
family39s favorite recipe is easy to put together and the leftovers make great meatloaf sandwiches
fabulous meatloaf the only tweaks i made was to add 12 cup a1 steak sauce and 14 cup brown sugar but i doubled the recipe made my top glaze from another 12 cup a1 steak sauce and 14 cup brown sugar
i had never made a meatloaf before but decided to make one using this recipe with a couple small modifications i only used 13 cup of milk i used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers and i baked it for 75 minutes it came out absolutely fantastic
i started making this recipe years ago when i was about 14 years old my grandmother gifted me a taste of home recipe book and i found this recipe after i made it the first time it the first time for my parents and brother it was a hit now i make it for my husband and five daughters such a wonderful recipe and turns out delicious every time
this was the worst meat loaf there was no taste and it was too runny will never make again
loved this recipe to cut calories i didn39t put any sauce on until the very end and only used a mixture of 14 cup bbq sauce 18 cup ketchup and a t of mustard still very moist used 12 pork sausage and 12 beef i didn39t have sage in the house so i skipped that
we loved this meatloaf recipe great flavor and taught me how to make it moist while still holding together i threw some mushrooms on top and some cheddar cheese
amazingly easy to prepare first i cook on auto pilot this means i end up with a modified recipe bu it turned out perfect and delicious plus i have never made meatloaf without tomato sauce i choose this recipe as i could not bare making my fabulous recipe today she was a wonderful cook almost day and i miss her every day i find healing though cooking and am even inspired by asking my 91 year old dad to share his own cooking tips with me may will be a celebration by sharing with my family some of favorite dishes
i have five kids of varying ages and this is something they all love made it for guests before thinking it may be too simple for a meal but everyone left raving about it all asked for the recipe this one is a definite winner
i don39t know how many meatloafs i39ve made over the years or how many different versions i39ve tried but this is my very favorite i make a couple of changes though i use 2 pounds of ground beef or meatloaf mix that39s good too otherwise it turns out too 34loose34 for our taste i grate the onion instead of chopping it that way its taste is distributed evenly throughout the loaf and finally instead of one freeform loaf in the middle of my 1334 x 934 pyrex pan i make two that way there39s more surface to be covered with the sauce and we just like it better that way leftovers make awesome sandwiches too thanks for sharing this great recipe michelle beran
delicious next time though i39ll follow the advice of a previous review and add the worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and skip the sauce my family only likes a little sauce on top and this recipe made way more than we needed instead i39ll just add a little ketchup to the top before cooking i used 225 pounds of ground beef instead of 15 pounds because that39s how it was packaged and i didn39t have a need to save a small amount it still turned out fantastic much better than using the meatloaf seasoning packet like i39ve always done before
i have 4 very very picky kids the oldest is 13 they pretty much all 4 live on pizza every day no kidding until i made this and made all 4 of them at least try it guess what i am now making it at least once a week and all 4 of them absolutely love it so i39ve been doubling everything and they eat every last bit of it at least by the next evening all 4 kids and myself would like to thank you for this wonderful meatloaf it39s a huge hit in our home god bless
this is very similar to my with a couple of small exceptions she added the worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and then just used ketchup to top it i think i would miss the brown sugar delicious and thank you for sharing your version
never made a decent meatloaf which family care for anyway found this recipe in taste of copycat favorites book bingo change a thing and has now become a favorite i am feeling
very similar to my mom39s meatloaf though we use ritz crackers a couple eggs and the topping is brown sugar ketchup mustard worcestershire sauce i do like the comment to wet d oi wn your 34crumbs34 prior to adding to the meat mix
this is basically the recipe used for many years minus the sage which i only like in cornbread dressing i like to soak the crackers in the milk until they are soft before adding to the meat you can also add chopped bell pepper for extra flavor the only meatloaf recipe ever use
instead of baking in the oven i cooked it on my smoker we all loved it
i39ve been making this recipe for years and we love it i substitute plain bread crumbs for the saltines but it is great either way
my mom always made her meatloaf with 8020 ground beef
tried this recipe last year and we love it makes tasty sandwiches the next day too
i have always loved meat loaf but know how much till i tried this recipe it is now my go to meat loaf recipe love it
my husband and kids loved this meatloaf this recipe is a keeper
trying to eat healthier used ground turkey also added minced garlic good bread crumbs and chili sauce
this is always a hit my husband devours this meatloaf he even admitted that after all the years of loving his mom39s meatloaf he thinks this is even better
margycravathgmailcom great recipei added a touch of prepared mustard and a capsule apple cider vinegar to ketchup
i39m not a big fan of meatloaf but this was very good made it exact but will cut back on the milk next time great comfort meal thanks michelle
i tried this recipe without the milk onion and saltinesused italian bread crumbs for the saltinesa huge hit with my husband and i can39t wait to make it again and tweak it a bit
i learned this from my mom too the brown sugar is that secret ingredient that is the game changer i try to stay away from sugar but meat loaf without it is just 34meh34
it39s goooood
i got this from you magazine several years ago first of all it is delicious several homes brought it to love it at holiday time i am asked to bring it for our main recipe just the best recipe you will ever have also very easy to make you owe it to yourself and family and friends to try this one
i always add diced bell peppers to my meatloaf and several slices of bread crackers would add to much salt
i love this meatloaf very flavorful and the leftovers are great as well this one39s definitely a keeper
i have never been a fan of meatloaf either but this recipe won me over the only change i made was omitting the sage the meatloaf came out moist and flavorful my kids loved it and the leftovers didn39t last very long this is now my 39go to39 recipe when my husband requests meatloaf from now on
hellojust recently made your meatloaf but it didn39t turn out i followed the directions exactly but it seemed overly moist when trying to form into the loaf it actually fell apart during cooking any suggestions smelled wonderful and tasted great but would want it to hold its shape to be able to slice for presentation and sandwiches for leftovers
i made a meatloaf for my sweeties sister she loves meatloaf him not so much i had some caramelized onions left over from something else and decided to put them in a small portion of the meatloaf mix for just him then i topped it with barbque sauce i lined the loaf pan with foil and made a separate section for his meatloaf by making a foil partition he loved it they will be getting both now she loved this recipe
yummy a simple and delicious meatloaf having fewer veggies in the recipe makes for a denser meatloaf so it makes it easier to cut into slices for sandwiches
i find best meatloaf is a combination of ground beef pork and veal
i have made this a few times although i always halve the recipe as there are only two of us eating it it is a very nice meatloaf being easy to make and very tasty today i used the ground veal that i got on sale at the store and it was just as tasty as the ground beef i think you would use whatever ground meat you have on hand
the best meatloaf i have ever had
we love this recipe so much that we had it for a christmas party it was a big hit reqested recipe
i use 2 lbs ground beef and 12 ozs of jimmy dean sage sausage no brown sugar and 1 chopped green pepper also 1 can of evaporated milk and a whole sleeve of crackers the sausage and green pepper takes it to another level still use the sage seasoning and one8 oz of tomato sauce instead of catsup use half in the meatloaf and half as the topping
this is my favorite recipe but instead of the crackers use bread crumbs
i agree with randall i made it today and followed recipe exactly as said sorry but this is the worst meatloaf i ever made i landed up giving it to my cats
the blending is great the ketchup and brown sugar combo topping is like having candy for diner i suggest using half a ketchupworcestershire in the blend and the rest as the topping no brown sugar
i made this meatloaf today and it turned out awesome i used chicken stock instead of milk and added more saltine crackers i used a whole sleeve at the end of 60 minutes i turned the oven off opened the oven door and let it sit there for another hour meatloaf was juicy and delicious i also used less brown sugar in the recipe
made this last night omg it is the best i must say i did make some changes but my hubby has always liked my usual meatloaf but he loves this one i replaced the milk with a can of golden mushroom soup packet of lipton onion soup deleted the sage not big sage fans the amount of cracker crumbs had to increased i used almost a full sleeve of crackers and probably could have been ok with the whole sleeve it is a winner in our book
my wife and i made this just by the recipe and it was nasty thought we had made a mistake so we did it again this is the worse tasting meat loafs i have ever tasted i39ll never make it again
very good recipe my go to i read all the comments and altered it like thisi used 8020 ground so i doubled the cracker to 1 12 cups ritz and i used 12 cup cream instead of milk to help make it firmer it39s important to let the meatloaf rest 10 minutes before servingi also altered the topping adding prepared mustard using less ketchup and adding less brown sugarcame out great
wonderful meat loaf recipe the saltines milk and eggs make it super tender and the sage doesn39t overpower at alljust adds a nice earthy warmth to it the sauce was a bit too sweet for us so next time i39ll cut back on the brown sugar but this is a great meatloaf and something i39ll definitely make againvolunteer field editor
i was never a meatloaf fan but i substitute ritz crackers and we love this recipe my 4 year old son cried when i told him i was making meatloaf he ate 4 helpings and now both him and his dad ask for this atleast once a week the sauce makes it perfect and it39s so simple definitely a staple in our house
doubled the recipe and made 2 i did not make the sauce just used ketchup straight from the bottle there was none left and everyone loved it thanks for the recipe
great meatloaf recipe the sage gives a special touch i love the sauce on the side to use as much as desired
switched milk with tomato sauce and it was amazingmy very picky family loves it and ask for it often
i don39t even like meatloaf but this was amazing kids loved it too my daughter who is very picky was nibbling at it all night very moist and the sauce was wonderful
sugar in a beef meatloaf just doesn39t sound right
too sweet maybe cut the brown sugar in half also think it needs more crackers as the texture was 34sloppy34 basically fell apart as soon as i lifted it outi absolutely hated it but my wife liked it i39d give it a zero she gave it a 4so my rating is half way between to each their own sorry for her but since i39m the cook i won39t be making this again if you like a sweeter tasting meatloaf this is the one for you
this is hands down the best meatloaf i have ever eatenmy 13 year old grandson loved it what better compliment than that there was enough for dinner and leftover for hot meatloaf sandwichesthe sweet and sour sauce is amazing
i loved this meatloaf i would have given this a 5 star however my family did not like the barbecue sauce
love this recipe i cook it in the crock pot i have substituted venison for the ground beef
very good and simple recipe it39s a go to at our house husband loves making meatloaf sandwiches the next day been making this for years and everyone always raves about it we love the sauce
this meat loaf is moist and flavorful another keeper
i have made this hundreds of times everyone raves about it i have modified it sometimes sometimes i add celery i often use 1 hamburg and 12 lean ground pork i put chopped green peppers in occasionally and used it to stuff green peppers i think is the sauce that people really like
20 years of proofbeing a working mom i was looking for a meatloaf my whole family would lovei made 6 different meatloafs one day and had the family try all hands down this was there favorite my kids come home and still want this over almost anything else i make one of there favorite foods and warm family memories go with this meal i now make this for my grandkids and for the stubborn eaters i now put chopped or mashed veggies in i cover with part of sauce not real heavy then put the rest in a bowl warm for those who like more try with your family and you will have a new easy family favorite
this is a great recipei no longer use any other i substitute panko for saltines and since my family doesn39t love sage in beef i substitute granulated garlic
this is a test comment
use ground chuck and a half pound of ground pork and also panko bread crumbs no sugar or salt use some diced green pepper and onion for added background flavor maybe a couple of bacon strips on top best ever and better meatloaf sandwiches the next day for diabetes person
botanner then tweek the recipe to cut down the salt
absolutely yummy this is a keeper
i have made this many times we love it i cut the salt to 14 tsp or omit altogether i use bread crumbs in place of crackers i shape it to fit my crockpot place it on aluminum foil with holes poked in it to release the fat put it on a rack or a couple of jar covers sidebyside and cook it on low for 45 hours pour the sauce on the top of the loaf for the last 3045 minutes this is delicious
the sauce i knew would be too sweet for our taste i didn39t use any of the brown sugar and instead used less milk and a little ketchup in the meat mixture and of course on top i also used more spice garlic powder marjoram and a lot of pepper as is our preference almost carmelizing the onions is something i39ve always done it adds a lot more flavor to the meatloaf i39ve never measured the crackers i just crumble until it looks right this recipe with my modifications is how my mom made meatloaf minus the onions
good recipe but the sauce was a bit too sweet and tasted more like a barbecue sauce i would cut the amount of sugar by half next time i baked mine in muffin tins at 350 for about 30 minutes
delicious this recipe is good i just changed two little thing instead of 12c sugar i do 1tbs and the sauce i pore everything on the meatloaf made it like this every time including the very first love taste of home recipes everything i made was delicious
this meatloaf was very good my whole family loved it and my husband is not a 34meatloaf guy34 i didn39t have any problems with it being dry at all or falling apart i give it 4 stars only bc it was a little too sweet for me as well and without the sauce the meat was pretty bland although my husband liked the fact that the meat wasn39t overly seasoned bc the sauce had a great taste the only thing i may do next time is season the meat a little more and probably not put as much brown sugar but i wouldn39t make many changes bc my family husband and 2 kids loved it i paired it with some mashed potatoes and green beans overall a great meal
i am sorry but this was not good at all very dry we threw what was left in the garbage followed the recipe exactly i have two other go to meatloaf recipes that i will continue to use what intrigued me was the crackers in it because mine falls apart a lot i will not make this again no flavor either i felt like i was eating dry hamburgers
i followed the recipe exactly and i ended up with a sloppy mess the loaf just fell apart also the sauce is way too sweet
i have made this in my crockpot for years best meatloaf recipe ever i never liked meatloaf before trying this recipe
this was really good my husband was never a huge meatloaf fan but he also gave this 5 stars i only put in half the brown sugar that the recipe called for because 1 i39m trying to cut down on sugar and 2 there were a number of reviews saying the sauce was pretty sweet with half the sugar it still seemed pretty sweet to me next time i will put in a quarter of the sugar that the recipe calls for
very good flavor for a traditional meatloaf
i have made this for many years it is my family39s favorite love the sauce on top and having leftovers for sandwichesthough i have to make 2 to have leftovers i used ritz crackers instead of the saltines this time and loved it just as much
i was never a meatloaf fan but reluctantly agreed to make it for my husband after constant requests i used this recipie and now i love meatloaf i make it all the time and no matter who is eating they all go back to seconds and there are no leftovers
this is delicious we have made it several times and i doubt we will ever stop
excellent i made this exactly per the recipe and will be making again for sure served oven crispy potatoes
made this for the first last week and have cooked it four times by special requests from familythey all love iti use 2 pounds of ground beef and increased other ingredients accordingly since my family does not like catsup i use sweet baby ray original saucethis meatloaf is gourmet i also substitute saltines in favor of club or ritz crackers instead of bulb onion i used about 6 green onions including the green parts this meatloaf has lots of flavor
love it i39ve tried several different meatloaf recipes my husband loves meatloaf and this is the one my husband thinks is the absolute best i39ve never been much of a meatloaf fan and even i truly enjoy it the only change i made was to reduce everything by a third since there are only two of us and we still have leftovers for the next day39s lunch at least he does
my husband loves my meatloaf but i39m always on the lookout for new recipes and ways to make it mine rarely turns out the same two times in a row but he always loves itseeing that this had 5 stars i decided to try it i made it exactly as the recipe was written yes it was moist but it was the most bland tasteless meatloaf i have ever made totally a waste of good ground beef sorry but i won39t be making this recipe ever again
this is my favorite meat loaf recipe
awesome we really liked this meatloaf recipe i rarely make meatloaf but this recipe might change that
i love it but some times i use italian bread crumbs instead of saltines
this is baking in my oven right now on a rainy cool sunday afternoon i have made this meatloaf many times beforeand i think the sage gives this meatloaf the unique flavor it smells so good baking i do use reduced sodium crackers worcestershire and catsup as a rule in cooking it is moist and flavorful served with yams and roasted carrots of many colors this meal is a winner in our home thanks for sharing michelle
i made this with 937 ground beef and skim milk my husband liked the sauce and also said it was moist and tender but held together nicely he still prefers his mom39s meatloaf recipe
best i have ever had
my family loves this recipe i do not use the sage i add a little ketchup to the meat mixture just cause i like a little tomatoy inside the loaf i sometimes poke holes on the loaf so the topping can seep into the loaf
i have made this and 34easy meatloaf34 several times for this recipe we really like the ketchup mixture topping
too much sugar in this recipe both added and hidden try using tomato paste with a little worchestershire sauce stirred in for your topping with bell pepper rings for garnish i like the yellow ones instead of a runnier sauce you will have a tangier topping that is absorbed into the flavor of the meatloaf in the top layer change the saltines to seasoned bread crumbs italian or garlic seasoned add chopped sundried tomatoes to bring hints of the tomato tang throughout the meatloaf and use chopped sweet hawaiian onions for a flavor balance
if i had ground beef in the house right now i would make this for dinner it39s freezing cold here in los angeles california and this sounds like it would warm our hearts gt perhaps i39m on my way to the market yep my husband had a dr apt and took me to grocer it39s in the oven right now made exactly as written i39ll report back39deeeeeeeelishsgwing gt 34use less what34kittiekatt gt all due respect to you as well my mil without fail always used crushed saltines for her meatloaf and meatballs they were always exactly the same and 2 of my favorite meals she made our kids well they adored it and her
this was very good but a little too soft for my taste i think next time i39ll use less and see if that might firm it up
i had never made meatloaf before and have never cared much for it either but my husband asked for it one night this recipe was super easy to make and tasted delicious my husband loved it and i did too he especially liked the sauce i used breadcrumbs in place of crushed saltines i would highly recommend this recipe
i39m a single dad who like many people i39m raising my child on my own i39ll be the first to admit that my cooking skills would make chef boyardee and martha stewart blush in shame however last night i tried this meatloaf and man you should have seen the look on my kids face after her first bite it was worth the time and effort what topped it off she asked for thirds thank you
this stuff is dope i almost never eat ground beef but was looking for something different to make for dinner seriously delicious made the recipe exactly as written used the extra sauce too and loved it great combination of savoury and sweet reminiscent of good southern bbq would gladly make again very soon thanks for this scrumptious dish
too sweet would just use a little ketchup and not add brown sugar or add very little
my family really liked this one and while i did too i think i might tweak it a little maybe a little diced green pepper in it or a little more worcestershire sauce definitely a keeper though
meatloaf is a family favorite and this is a good one i usually mix a 12 pound of ground pork with 1 pound of ground beef in my meatloaf served with some mashed potatoes this is comfort food at its best
great
i really enjoyed this recipe it made a lot of food and tasted great i served it with mashed potatoes and smothered with brown gravy on top instead of the reserved sauce and it was filling and delicious perfect for a chilly night thanks for the recipe
i too have commented repeatedly about the rudeness of the reviewers on this site i don39t see this as much on other cooking sites sure hate to try and meet their standards i appreciate suggestions amp honest critiques
wow delicious i used thyme instead of sage because i don39t care for sage put a couple dashes of worcheshire and ketchup in the meat mixture used 75 lean other than that i followed the recipe it is sooo juicy and delicious served it with baked sweet potatoes definitely a keeper thanks
yummy i added14 of ground sausage everyone raved i39m not usually a fan of this but it was the best i39ve had
i used oatmeal instead of saltines and did not add more salt the meatloaf was bland without sauce and i used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar great flavor on sauce i will follow recipe as is to get the true flavor and i used a meatloaf mixture instead of all ground beef i will make recipe again and post another review some times it doesn39t work when substitutions are made from early on or first time following recipe my bad
i have been making a recipe almost exactly like this for 40 years the only difference is that i use quick rolled oats instead of saltine crackers and omit the sage although i will try sage next time just to see if the family likes that spice in the meatloaf thanks for sharing our mothers before us knew what satisfied at the dinner table that39s why recipes like this are still around albeit with slight differences
this is my family39s favorite meatloaf recipe i have been making it for over 15 years if i try a different recipe they know it i believe the sauce is what makes it so good
good flavor
donalee2 first of all you don39t type in all caps as you are shouting secondly and most importantly why on earth are you reviewing a recipe you haven39t even tried seriously
this is a good meatloaf recipe i agree with the others i wish reviewers would not bombard us with their negative comments not all recipies are to everyone39s liking but please be considerate of the submitter and professional about your review
there are very few recipes that get this high a ratingagree with 120 out of 125 on this one also agree with another reviewerno need to be so negative on a recipe it can be done tastefully if you do not care for itie this has too much salt for me or it is a bit too sweet for my family
donalee not that many calories if you exercise a bit during the week you should wait till sunday to do your preaching this is our go to meat loaf recipe except if we use saltines we eliminate the salt most of the time we use italian bread crumbs
i have been making this for many years excellent recipe
i haven39t tried this recipe but it seems like it is an awful lot of calories for just one piece of meatloaf that is almost your whole meal worth of calories donalee 2
i39ve been making this recipe for years 11 and it39s one of my go to recipes the meatloaf is moist and very flavorful love love love it and my husband who grew up having meatloaf loves it too
held form well well and texture good a little too salty for my taste with saltines and salt may leave salt out next time
i made this into a spectacular bacon meatloaffantastic base recipechanges i fried 2 chopped thick bacon pieces in a skillet and blended them with the milk and eggs for 15 seconds then i added spices to the leftover bacon grease in the skillet and sauteed the onions in it until they started to caramelizebefore mixing it all togethersauteeing the onions and adding the blended bacon gives the meatloaf an extra delicious kick without changing the yummy texture
great meatloaf recipe that was easy to make
the worst meatloaf ive ever tasted i followed recipe to the 34t34yak
excellent
this was excellent thank you for sharing your mothers recipe with us everyone39s taste is different and tweeks things the way they want i think if you do not have something nice to say you should not say it at allwe loved the recipe
delicious can39t wait for leftovers made mashed potatoes and pioneers womans best green beans also made a fruit salad sooooo good
we love this meatloaf even my meatloaf hating son the sauce is the winner and is sooo yummy this isn39t to sweet for us but can easily be adjusted for others who don39t like it this sweet the only adjustment i do is use bread crumbs instead of crackers
excellent meat loaf made 8 mini loafs with this recipe added a 12 pound of sweet italian sausage to it will make this again
awesome i used only 1 lb of ground beef worked great
we loved this even though neither of us are big meat loaf fans thinking i had enough ketchup i ended up having to use about 12 cup of bbq sauce to supplement still turned out great
omg best meatloaf ever delicious
i love this meatloaf been making similar one for years instead of worcestershire in the topping i use tabasco we love the sweet hot taste especially good on those sandwiches made from the leftovers yum
a most excellent meatloaf my husband claims it39s the best he39s ever had i agree i did substitute 12 lb of mild italian sausage for the 12 lb of ground beef i will never use another recipe for meatloaf again thanks
this recipe is the exact same recipe as the one published in the better homes and gardens cookbook my version of the cookbook is just over 30 years old
this was awesome made it tonight for dinner and my family loved it will definitely make this again
i wouldn39t have thought this would be so different but it was and it was wonderful my hubby loved it too i loved it and am making it again today thanks for sharing the recipe
been making meatloaf this way for years except i use 1 1b ground beef and 12 lb ground pork i add a little minced celery and saute them with the onions and clove of garlic to soften them up as we don39t like crunchy veggies in meatloaf i also use crushed onion crackers vs saltines and add a pinch of dried mustard excellent meatloaf
i39ve been making this recipe for years won39t make any other meatloaf but this one plus it39s so easy to put together everyone loves it just the way it is delicious
i use this same recipe except i exchanged the saltines with oatmeal and instead of worcestershire sauce i use mustard i use ground turkey instead of beef my family loves it thanks for sharing
the only thing i changed was half the sugar i don39t like sweet meat yum
i39ve been searching for a meatloaf as good as grams used to be and this is it moist flavorful and thumbs up from the whole supper table only changes i made were used 2lbs of 8020 ground beef because that39s what i had and omitted the sage because i didn39t have any it still turned out delicious thanks for sharing this is a keeper
made this for my family tonight amp it was a hit future husband told me it was better than his mom39s super easy to make as well will definitely be my go to meatloaf recipe
i used a little bit of ground pork with the ground beef and used poultry seasoning instead of sage i didn39t think such a simple meatloaf recipe would come out so simply delicious so much more easier than the meatloaf i usually make this is ridiculously good my family loved it
i have been using this meatloaf recipe for almost 17 years now and there are never any leftovers i have played with it some over the years and it can be as sweet as you want it to be or just use less of the brown sugar my family loves this recipe thank you for sharing
awful to sweet
i have made this recipe for several years sometimes i add grated cheese inside sometimes i make into about 7 or 8 small loaves and bake about 45 minutes when i39m in a hurry
i have made this meatloaf for years i have 5 boys and double the recipe we never have leftovers i also made this for my parents 50th wedding anniversary party 50 people everyone loved it and wanted the recipe this is the best meatloaf ever would not understand how someone would not like it
really good i didn39t have any cracker39s so i used breadcrumbs also only one egg turned out great
this is very tasty we both loved it i used club crackers in place of saltines 12 tsp salt 1 tsp pepper minced garlic cloves 23 and used 2 to 212 lbs meatloaf mix and 1 lb 8020 ground beef i have tried so many recipes for meatloaf but this is my go to now
this was awful my husband loves meatloaf so i thought i would give this recipe a go i couldn39t finish my meal amp he proceeded to throw away the leftovers thanks for the 12 waste
to 39buddystar39 rubbed sage is just crushed sage that is rubbed between your fingers and then added to your mix this is a very good recipe but i omit the sage but at times i will add some chopped green pepper
this was a pretty good meatloaf i usually don39t like putting raw onion in meatloaf want to saute it but this came out really well will definitely make it again
excellent
my husband loves meatloaf this is the first one i have made that his loves
i39ve made this meat loaf several time amp never have any left over39s if i don39t have crackers i use oatmeal or break up bread amp add a little garlic salti add ketchup in meat amp top off with sugar amp ketchup on top amp bake very good
what is 34rubbed sage34
i did make some alterations to this recipe first change was i used almond milk used original that is what i had on hand because i have a son highly allergic to dairy milk then the 2nd change is that i added about 14 cup of a1 sauce to the ketchup mixture to add a little more of a kicki absolutely love the way it turned out if you need to substitute the milk because of allergies this is a great recipe
my husband and i have been together for 11 years and i have only made meatloaf once or twice he loves meatloaf but i hate ituntil now the recipe is simple to make and full of flavor my husband requested that i make it once a week i also cooked this recipe for a family gettogether and everyone kept telling me how good it was next day leftovers are amazing too
i love this recipe i accidentally added all ingredients togethertopping and all it was too moist but my family loved it next time i still put all ingredients togetherjust cut back on the ketchup the flavor were great together brown sugar sage and ketchup it is our family favorite out of mistakes comes something awesome
tasted just like my mother mae it good memory
i just made this today and it came out perfect i will never need to try another meatloaf recipe my husband loved it this is my first reviewi joined just to tell you how good this meatloaf and sauce was thanks for sharing it
delicious made this for the first time today doubled the recipe and my husband said he could eat an entire loaf himself my 11 year old son was amazed about how much he liked it in fact he said 34mom i want you to make that meatloaf for my birthday34 for the sauce i didn39t have ketchup so i used tomato sauce instead and cooked the sauce for a few minutes on the stove to thicken it a bit before spreading on the meatloaf
this is a delicious tender meatloaf i am not a fan of ketchup on meatloaf but loved this onethe brown sugar and worcestershire sauce make all the difference its our family39s favorite meatloaf recipe
i have tried so many good meatloaf recipes but this one is soooo delicious i will definitely be making this one more often so easy and the house smells wonderful while it39s cooking
this is a yummy classic meat loaf recipe who doesn39t love a classic meat loaf
this meatloaf is out of this world i did use breadcrumbs instead of saltines since i didn39t have any in the house and it still came out beautifully i will make this again and again for my friends and family
this was soo good and so easy first time i39ve ever made meatloaf and it came out excellent can39t wait to make it again oh and i doubled the worcestershire bc we love it so much haha
very easy to make and will definitely make it again it makes a lot of sauce for the top so the second time i made it i cut the sauce part in half and still had plenty for the top of the meatloaf
so delicious made with ground turkey i also placed some sliced pickled jalapenos on the meatloaf before pouring on the sauce yum
i made this meatloaf recipe times 2 and some mac 39n39 cheese to send to two different families who are coping with sick loved ones i was a little nervous because i hadn39t made it before i cut it into nice slices before packaging it up for sending which allowed me to taste a slice first it was delicious both families prefer simple homecooked foods and this was just the ticket when i told my sister about the recipe she reminded me that our mom used to use crumbled saltines in her meatloaf way back when i only made a couple of slight variations to the recipe here i used 2 lbs of ground round and i added about 13 of a packet of lipton onion soup mix to the recipe something my mom always used in meatloaf i also only made up a halfquantity of the topping sauce because i didn39t send any with the meatloaf for serving i kept a couple slices behind for dinner that night and my husband asked for seconds there weren39t any he doesn39t even usually like meatloaf
i39ve been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it it39s easy uses ingredients i usually have on hand and is great left over the only thing i change is that i usually add either fresh garlic or garlic powder
this is my most requested dish when i tell everyone i am making meatloaf the first time they are not so excited but once they eat it they are mad at me if i dont invite them over when i make it
great
i always cut the topping down by half because i39ve found it to be more than enough to cover the meatloaf and still leave some extra for a topping after it cooksalso since i usually don39t have sage handy i substitute 14 tsp thyme 14 tsp oregano and a few pinches of dried parsleyoh and the more onion the better
excellent meat loaf recipe i made a few adjustments to sub for ingredients i had on hand garlic amp herb breadcrumbs for saltines garlic powder for sage honey bbq sauce for ketchup also added bacon strips to the top before backing both my husband and seven year old love it
great recipe for a basic meatloaf i used 2 hamburger and increased the other ingredients a little i made 2 small loaves and poured all of the sauce on top before i baked them my family thought this was delicious i39ll definitely make this again
i served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it it was the best meat loaf i have ever eaten i don39t think there was any left over
i added some diced celery and 12 tsp of garlic powder and substituted thyme for the sage because i didn39t have any sage it was very tasty and i will make it again
this meatloaf is the best i39ve ever had i made it one night my mother doesn39t even like meatloafbut she loves this one
it was very tasty
i made this for dinner tonight it was easy and perfectly done all my family even my 3 picky eating kids loved it i will definitely add this to my weekly recipes
this was a hit with my picky eaters will definitely make this again
fantastic recipe definitely a keeper
delicious i added garlic powder and dried thyme the sauce on top makes it special
pmoist and very tasty it makes a lot of sauce so i cut the sauce portion of it in half and still had plenty of saucep
good meatloaf my husband said it reminds him of his mother39s meatloaf
very good and very tasty i changed a little bit by replacing some of the crumbs with bran and added garlic
excellent just the right size for two people
yum yum yummy will make again i also didn39t have an onion on hand so we used dried minced onions that you get off the spice aislethe conversions were on our bottle great to make if you have are running low on ingredients to make most other ground beef recipes d
my this meatloaf is one my whole family loves i made some gravy from the pan drippings for the mashed potatoes yummy
i have made a lot of meat loaf recipes but this is by far my favorite my family loves it just as much as i do it39s so full of flavor i have made this meat loaf many times and never get tired of it
this is a great recipe and the only meat loaf recipe i use we like the use of sage and the flavor it gives makes a wonderful sandwich from leftovers
i had been looking for a great meatloaf recipe and bought the magazine specifically for this recipe i have made this meatloaf several times and i absolutely love it i add in about 116 tsp of dry mustard and as i don39t like ketchup i substitute bbq sauce and it works great the meatloaf is tender and very flavourful also because i39m single i actually double the recipe and make two loaves slice them after cooling and freeze into individual portions i generally have some at least once a week it39s that good
not my husband nor myself cared for meatloaf until i tried this recipe now it is a favorite dish i have made this meatloaf for company many times and everyone likes it i break up the brown sugar and warm the ketchupthat seems to help the sauce mix better
husband loved it
i have made this more times than i can count and it is always delicious i double the worcesteshire sauce for added flavor
was told to put this meatloaf in the rotation for dinner
i took out the sage and worst sauce i have picky eaters to feed i also cut the ketchup to 14 and i glazed it after 30 mins it was so good i half wished i made more it was soooo good i served it with scalloped potatoes and steamed carrots and corn and a salad with red onion cucumbers mushrooms grated cheddar cheese and home made ranch dressing
made 12 recipe put in buttered loaf panexcellent
a true favorite of my husbands he loves the sauce
i did not like meat loaf or meatballs until i tried this recipe i make this quite often and just love it
so easy to make and the glaze is delicious
this is the best meatloaf ever i39ve been using this recipe since its publication i gave the recipe to a coworker who could not find a meatloaf recipe that her kids would eat and she ended up making it three times that first week at the kids request
this is the only meat loaf i ever use anymore have made it dozens of times not only for family but for special guests and people go back for seconds
delicious i followed the recipe exactly and my family thoroughly enjoyed it
this recipe was quite easy everything was mixed in one bowl so clean up was minimal it has a sweet and tangy flavor very good
it39s the topping that for me really makes this recipe i use it all the time even on top of other meatloaf recipes much better than ketchup
i started making this recipe when it was first published in toh and my family loves it they will not let me make meatloaf with any other recipe
i love this recipe in fact i have shared this with many of my family members who rave about it too my youngest son who is 8 requests this one oftenlara
this recipe has been a hit in our home since publication the only change i have made is we omit the sage
simple moist tasty meatloaf also recommend meat mixture for italian meatballs dott
pi had prepared this meatloaf when it first was featured in taste of home i did make the following adjustments i used italian bread crumbs 1 onion chopped 12 tsp italian seasoning 14 tsp pepper and 1 cup of barbecue sauce at that time since i didn39t have the ingredients to make regular bbq sauce i39d used a meatloaf pan to bake this meatloafppi would probably omit the brown sugar in this sauce if i choose to use prepared bbq sauce and i39d probably omit the worcestershire sauce since bbq sauce has all the additions in it already as i recall this meatloaf was really good thank you for sharing it with taste of home delowensteinp
great recipe my picky eaters ate it all up
this was a wonderful cake i say 34was34 since it didn39t last the weekend i split the cake batter into two round 9 inch springform pans and used a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges all the store had at the time and it produced a moist cake that was light but paired well with the frosting i had enough frosting left over my household prefers a lightly frosted cake to do a five cup salad variation for dessert as well will make this again and again
i have been making this recipe for years it is my mother in recipe and one of my favorites she calls it pineapple sunshine and one of my good friends calls it good it is so good and very easy to make also you can keep the ingredients on hand for a quick dessert to take to a potluck or just for company
that looks quite good for our restricted diets thanks for the recipe
my husband39s uncle wally introduced us to pig pickin39 cake over 30 years ago he explained that it39s called a pig pickin39 cake because it was the traditional dish brought to a pig picking in his neck of north carolina a pig picking being a 34neighborhood34 event that follows a pig roasting after the pig is roasted the women get together to pick and shred the meat from the carcass for the making of traditional carolina bbq our family39s version includes a golden butter cake mix box 12c oil the fruit from acan of mandarins and 4t of the juice and 3 whole eggs the frosting is 20can of crushed pineapple not drained with 1 box instant vanilla pudding mixed in after about 5 mins fold the whipped topping 12oz into the puddingpineapple i have made this as a sheet cake 2 layer cake cupcakes or in a springform cut into 3 layers always delicious and one of my very favorite desserts thanks uncle wally miss you
here in the south this little gem is known as a pig pickin39 cake if you39re super health conscious you can certainly make it according to this recipe but we like it a tiny bit more indulgent in my house we use the whole eggs indicated on the cake mix canola oil instead of applesauce for the cake itself and regular pudding mix and whipped topping for the frosting we also add coconut and orange extract to the frosting mixture it39s delicious and a hit every time
have people now days become so lazy that they can39t beaten sweetened heavy cream and use it in recipes that call for frozen whipped topping the quality flavor and comfort factor is so much better
recipe says add whipping cream but ingredients doesn39t have any ant advice
delicious recipe cooling and light if you had a dry cake more than likely it was beating the egg whites too long which gives a dry product thanks for this keeper
my polish granny made this for years from scratchi would like the try this quicker version than compare
a dear friend made this for us for our anniversary i had to have the recipe too because it39s so delicious and it is simple to make
so i want to make this for easter i just use the cake mix and follow the directions correct not the directions on the cake box
i have made this cake following the recipe many times it39s perfection every time there39s a potluck or treats taken to work i am told that i have to bring this cake it39s so light and tasty my workmates call it the sunshine cake
made this cake yesterday and it39s half gone already just two people eating followed recipe and it came out perfect i am curious as to why the name change from 34pig picking cake 34 to 34pineapple orange cake34 i sense a bit of pcness going on as for the review from momof3 re pudding size i used the 1oz box called for so i don39t know where the claim of 34typo34 error comes from anyway follow the recipe and you39ll have a wonderful dessert
soundz so delish it
it39s a toss up between a 2amp3 i was not impressed w this cake at all i thought it was dry and did not taste orange at all the pudding size is a typo too this recipe has potential and i will remake it but not without making my own tweaks to improve it to my own liking topping was great i have made the same topping using coconut cream pudding and pineapple
i have been making this cake for about 20 yrs and i know it as the pineapple dream cake i bake it in 2 round layers and have always drained the crushed pineapple for the icing it has always been a big favorite of my family amp friends and since moving to sc it has become a favorite of my neighbors love it
this cake is alway a big hit and so easy to make best of all it is semi healthywe love it and i am always giving out the recipe has such wonderful flavor it is hard to have just one piece
i wanted to make this cake for a long time however i can39t eat gluten so i was dragging my feet pilsbury recently came out with a gluten free yellow cake mix that is made in a 9x13 pan so i figured i would give it a try first of all let me say that the cake baked up fabulously in fact i followed the cake recipe only changing to a gluten free cake mix i did make the frosting with a 12 oz size whipped cream i had some left over and and figured why not this cake was so moist and delicious even better the second day if you need to eat gluten free go ahead and make this cake i know i will make this cake again and again next time i think i will put some maraschino cherries on top
i made this cake for a memorial day party i made the 34fullfat34 version and added more orange juice to the batter to bump up the orange flavor i also made it with a golden butter cake mix as that was all i had in the pantry for decoration i put tons of red white and blue sprinkles on top it looked really festive and the kids went crazy for it the hostess put out all the desserts and no lie everyone pointed to my cake for a piece the taste was buttery and flavorful with all the fruit in it the pudding made the whipped topping silky and delicious this recipe is a keeper
my mother in law introduce the original version of this cake to me in 1974 and i have loved it every since i tasted it i am only going to rate the original because i haven39t tried the non reduce version yet
i made this cake for the first time this week and its so delicious and refreshing the topping is almost like a creamy fruit salad i too made a nonreduced version i39d rather have a small piece of the real deal than a bigger piece of artificial sweeteners fat free whatever etc so the changes i made upon reading the reviews were to the cake i added a tsp of orange extract used three whole eggs as called for on the cake mix box instead of egg whites and used canola oil instead of applesauceto the topping i used regular instant pudding and regular frozen whipped topping
my family loved this dessert i have now made it several times by special request my only advice to be sure to fold the whipped topping the first time i didn39t pay close attention and used a mix master came out runny but still tasted great thanks for sharing this new favorite for our family
this is one of my families favorite cakes moist delicious and refreshing
my husband loves it me too
need more orange use larger can idea add banana on cake before the topping
for the reviewers interested in using orange cake mixi purchased some on mar 26 for this recipe but i have not made it yet it was orange supreme by dh39s
i have this recipe in a 1982 church cookbook i purchased in kentucky the recipe calls this cake piglicking cake another recipe in same book calls it pig pickin cake but it adds orange juice in the mix whatever you call it it is a very good cake
i made this cake for our church bingo and it was gone in a flash we were surprised that people offered to pay two dollars for a second slice because it was so good
i have made this cake many times it is a favorite in our family but i changed it to use banana pudding mixsugarfree and use a small can of crushed pineapple which is sufficient also use 12 cup canola oil instead of applesauce my great grandson39s special cake it tastes like a banana flip
have been making this nonreduced cake for almost 40 years i do however add orange and pineapple extracts to intensify the flavor especially good on a hot summer day right out of the fridge
easy to make and very easy to eat
this is now my favorite cake it turned out flavorful and moist and best of all the caloriecount is reasonable for a dessert i added 2 teaspoons of orange extract to bumpup the orange flavor bettyann in san antonio texas
i also made this as a poke cake with orange sugarfree gelatin it is incredibly moist and adds more orange flavor sometimes i sprinkle it with toasted coconut love it
very moist super easy to make definate make again
i made this cake and it was good moist and lemony but i used lemon pudding instead of v as nilla i gave 8 people a piece and they all wanted the recipe
this has been a family favorite for years have no idea why people have had tasteless dry results never had that happen have been asked for recipes whenever i have served it at parties or brought to gatherings always make sure i have copies available wonderful summertime dessert we are a family of diabetics so this treat is special
i can39t wait to try this although i won39t use sugar free because my daughter in law doesn39t like the children to eat anything with artificial sweetener oh by the way it39s pig lickin not pig pickin
i was very disappointed with this recipe i agree with tilda 04 it was dry and had no flavor i was expecting an orangey tasting cake and could taste no orange i made this for my grandson age 13 and he did not care for it at all he loves everything i make for him and is so easy to please but this did not please had to throw it away
i don39t know what all the ravening is about this cake was not good at all made it yesterday i didn39t think it was moist in fact it was a little dry and didn39t have a taste i will not make it again
wonderful cake the grandkids love helping make this cake we enjoyed this very much thank you for sharing
nice light refreshing cake my husband does not have a sweet tooth so he appreciated this cake the most he can39t stand super sweet buttercream type frostings the mixture of pudding pineapple and whipped topping was perfect the cake was much more spongey than most cakes which made it come out of the pan without any problems at all i think i overmixed it because there were very few discernible bits of mandarin orange in it next time i39ll mix it less for sure thanks for this lovely alternative to the heavier sweeter quick desserts
i don39t get what all the fuss is about i made this for my family of 4 plus my motherinlaw who was visiting none of us thought it was anything special it was okay but i can39t see that i39ll be making it again
on my gosh is this wonderful refreshing and so tasty my group loved this ate it up within 5 minutes this is a definite keeperin answer to marykauhi i just used the small package of jello instant puddingi think that 1 oz pkg is a typo try this i39m not a fruit type dessert fan but wow is this yummy
i originally got all mixed up and put the pineapple in the cake and the mandarin orange in the topping which i made with 8 oz cream cheese instead of the whip topping yesterday i made this again and was careful to follow directions exactly i very much preferred my mixed up version and will be making it that way from now on
this has been a hit with everyone who has tried it from family friends and coworkers many have asked me for the recipe
light and delicious and a hit with everyone who39s tasted it i prefer to make the topping with regular instant pudding instead of sugarfree so there39s no hint of an aspartame aftertaste
i made this the other day and it was fantastic a keeper for sure
very delicious cool n refreshing for the summer i did add a tablespoon of grated orange rind to the cake bake batter though
i made this exactly according to the recipe and took it to a funeral dinner it was loved by all had several requests for the recipe light and moist definitely a keeper
good one
i made exactly as directed easy and a good recipe my family of 4 enjoyed and my husband just took the leftovers to his card night so hopefully the guys will like it also
this is one of my husband39s new favorites i made it the 34lesshealthy34 way and followed the yellow cake directions with added mandarin oranges i also added coconut to the coolwhipcrushed pineapple frosting out of this world good next time i plan to use the mandarin orange juice in place of the water in the cake mix and also add chopped mandarin oranges to the frosting
my whole family loves this cake i make it for every occassion diebeties run in my family this is good but i use a sugar free white cake mix best i have ever tasted it is a family favorite for all time

easy to make and a very good desert
simple and good however i didn39t do the local lofat noyolk method wo guilt next time i will use mandarin oranges instead of pineapple in the topping as well as in the cake the pineapple overpowers the orange flavor which i love to almost nonexistent

i made this recipe as part of our mother39s day menu and it was a total hit my father is diabetic so after reading another review i purchased the reduced sugar yellow cake mix by pillsbury i also used a can of light mandarin oranges used the egg whites from a carton in the egg section rather than cracking eggs and used sugar free cool whip it was delicious and my dad39s sugar didn39t shoot through the roof perfect the cake tastes much better after being in the fridge for at least 12 hours and got even better after that wonderful light dessert
me and my mom made it but it did not tast done so we put it in up to an 1hr but it steel was not done
how long do u leave it
one of the best if not the best ever i have made it several times and always a hit shared the recipe with lots of friends
you can make this cake up to two days ahead and it actually tastes better than when made and eaten on the same day it tastes very rich but isn39t nice cake for springtime
this cake is fabulous and so easy to make it39s a new family favorite
this should be 5 stars but the website won39t let me give it 5 stars
one of the best desserts on the planet
pi like other people prefer not to use sugarfree ingredients so i use regular pudding mix and regular cool whip tastes great ppalso wrong cklee i39m not sure why you felt the need to correct people a simple google search would have told you it is pig pickin39 not pig lickin39 i have no idea why you39d try to correct people without first making sure you were correct you39re notp
we like plenty of topping so i used about 12 oz of the whipped topping and about 1 12 pks of the pudding mix added a half cup of coconut spread it over the cake popped it in the fridge overnight and it was a wonderful light cool dessert perfect for the hot texas heat i will definitely make it again
so good and easy to make it is delicious and takes the guilt away from eating something sweet

i made this cake last sunday when i had friends over fo a wrestling show and they loved it some asked for seconds it was very good
my family and me thought this to be a excellent and yummy cake would not change a thing
my cake totally flopped i made sure all the ingredients were correct the cake was only about 1234 high the worst part was i took it to a potluck the only thing i can think of was i sprayed the dish with pam like the receipe said amp maybe it got on the sides never used spray before to grease a cake dish any thoughts on what happened would be appreciated
tasty my family really liked the texture of the cake and will definitely make it again i was surprised that it didn39t have much of an orange flavor but loved the topping
have made this by the original recipe and think this updated lower fat version is much better the topping could served in small dishes sprinkled with nuts or some other topping for a great light dessert
this cake is very good quick and easy to make
made this cake for my birthday to take to work everyone thought it was great it is a great light cakedont feel so bad when you eat this one great recipe

this recipe was really delicious my family loved it i wouldn39t change a thing about it
this is a very simple recipe and so refreshing will definitely make again especially this summer i shared the cake with my coworkers got very positive commentssandra sanborn
this is yummy very easy to make refreshing change from chocolate cake will definitely make it again
this was so simple to make very moist and tasty and much more volume than a regular cake good pot luck dessert
this is a delicious recipeand i have made it many timesvery light one of my husbands favorite
i don39t know what i did wrong but it turned out very heavy more like apound cake it was moist taste was ok but not what i expected i wanted it more like cake like the picture
this is a refreshing dessert and it is light i think personally the topping has too much pineapple but i39m not a strong pineapple lover i like the coconut idea just adds more calories easy to make looks good and tastes good
i made this for a small group of my friends and everyone really loved it it is very light and delicious
i made this for a fun party evryone loved it they wanted the recipe i am going to make for easter and add a little coconut on top and some peeps
this cake was delicious but i still lightened it with egg beaters egg whites and fat free cool whipthe cake itself was a tad on the heavy side but still very tasty
yes thank you for all your recipes the orange cake went it in a hurry delicious will make againjacqueline spencer
i made this cake to take to a dinner amp i did not think the cake part was very moist i liked the frosting i bake amp decorate cakes amp this one just did not seem moist it was sort of dry i thought
i made this cake for a party i was having i was very happy with how easy it was to prepare as i didn39t have alot of extra time my guests and family really liked itwhen i told them how easy it was to make they all wanted the recipe i will definetly make this cake again jeds
i have a local hawaiian recipe very similar the icing is a bit different calls for 8 oz cream cheese use light or fatfree 1 cup cold nonfat milk and 1 box vanilla instant pudding i haven39t tried it with sugarfree pudding it also called for a 20oz can of crushed pineapple drained the pineapple juice was used as liquid in the cake mix for icing beat cream cheese and pudding together slowly beat in milk to desired consistency fold in drained pineapple fold in 1 carton fat free cool whip spread on top of cake sprinkle with chopped macadamia nuts if desired refrigerate
amazingly moist cake family didn39t care for the icing thoughmostly a texture thing but also thought it made it too sweet used plain whipped topping instead
i fixed the cake for the first time turned out great i think you can drain the pineapple juice and would be fine
the sugar free instant pudding is 15 oz that should work just fine
the package they are referring to is the 4serving instant sugarfree pudding without sugar it weighs almost nothing i have also used lemon or butterscotch sugarfree instant pudding for something different two very ripe bananas are also good instead of the oranges it39s one of my favorites also
does anyone know how much pudding to use recipe says 1 oz but you can39t buy 1 oz pkgs
will a 102g vanilla instant pudding mix be the right amount to use in this recipe
pineapple orange cakeis the 1 oz pudding mix correct sizesb
banana will work in place of applesauce
a though to try other than apples pumpkin i have used this in recipe to bring down the fat and add nutrients that are good for you after reading this recipe i think it would be good with pumpkin
i39m allergic to apples does anyone know of another ingredient i could use instead of applesauce i have this difficulty with all recipes that are low in fat and use applesauce to provide the necessary moisture
that sounds great and nice and refeshing and will be good for my husband almost like my other angel food cake grace
sounds yummy and can not wait to try
i make this cake regularly without using the light stuff i add a lg can of mandarin oranges to the cake before baking i also add a whole can of drained oranges to the top of the cake after it39s topped with the cool whippineapple mixdelish
great comment mlowry this should answer the question about the pudding mix in this cake for those who want to try it i39m making this cake this weekend amp i can39t wait to taste it
one variation of this is to mix one small box of orange jello according to the box directions let the jello cool and pour over baked cake that you poked holes in you can use a fork to do this frosting the cake and chill in the frig overnight it39s tasty and pretty when you cut it
yes you do
re pineapple orange cakei just made this cake for the first time it was so easy it tastes absolutely wonderful does not tast like a light cake at all which makes it even better thanks for the recipenikki chorniak
doesn39t using a cake mix add partially hydrogenated oil to the ingredients therefore making it not heart healthy
the pudding mix will act as a thickener for the undrained pineapple
i am confused is the recipe wrong then the pineapple needs to be drained js
the recipe says 1 can 11 ounces crushed pineapple undrained
do you drain the pineapple or not it seems that the pudding would need some liquid jf
i make this cake and the pineapple needs to be drainedsmc
thank you for comment about adding the pudding mix dry i agree and will make it for easter
the pudding is dry and the pineapple with juice is added instead of mixing the pudding as directed on the box i have used this topping recipe with the cool whip to make a dream pie it is very good but it depends on what flavor pudding you use
i make a similar topping for a dessert and the pudding is not prepared first the juice and pineapple provide the liquid and when the whipped topping is added it makes a creamy topping with enough stability to spread if you prepare the pudding according top package directions it will be much too runnyit doesn39t include 34prepare according to directions34 because that is not what is to be done it states 34pudding mix34 instead so it should be added dry try it it is a great easy top layer for the cake
someone correct me if i39m wrong but i think that the liquid in the topping ingredients of undrained crushed pineapple and the whipped topping is enough to achieve the desired results for the topping of this cake
andrrea i believe the pudding mix is added dry to the topping normally instructions would state that you must prepare the pudding according to package directions if that is what is required
please post above comment about the pudding mix is it added without milk or made up first and then added to whipping i am going to make it for easter
this cake is fantastic and does get better each day i have used egg beaters instead of whites amp have used a yoplait orange or pineapple yogurt in place of applesauce a great cake naples fl
i39ve baked this cake a lot of times but i am going to bake it for easter using this lite version it is good with coconut added in the topping also
this is my favorie cake as well always turns out moist and delecious and so easy people think you really fussed and you didn39t
this is a fantastic recipe it just gets better and better until the pan is empty the pineapple really penetrates the flavor of the cake it is so much better the second day
sounds delicious but do you add the pudding mix dry to the pineapple
this is such an awesome recipe i have made is so many times no one can believe it is low fat it tastes so good on top of it all it is easy that is very important these days thanks for sharing it with us all
this is one of my favorite recipes i prefer to use white cake though
i make this recipe a lot i do add extra parmesan and another can of mushroom soup on top could not imagine leaving out the black olives that would make the recipe bland
we thought this recipe was rather bland the sauce was overpowered by the pasta if i make it again i would add more cheese tomatospaghetti sauce and less pasta
i usually try to make a recipe once the correct way and then make changes on the second time but for our maiden voyage tonight my whole family liked this a lot and they didn39t think we needed to do anything differently in the future as someone else wrote it seems a nice way to serve spaghetti to switch things up a bit very nice
very good could use a little more spice
a nice change from the usual spaghetti dinner i had fresh mushrooms that needed to be used so i chopped them up and put them in the onion and pepper saute my family really likes cheese so i doubled the amount of parmesan on the top this will definitely go into the recipe rotation
i will definitely make this i like every single ingredient in this so i fail to see why i wouldn39t like it
tasty hearty fillingdifferent enough to not seem like any other pasta dish don39t have veggie vans then cut things small and they really won39t notice like the idea to next time add pepperoni probably will double the parmesan on top
i found this recipe when i ordered my first taste of home recipe file it is easy filling and we love the taste this has been a family favorite for years it is just now just my husband and i now and i have found to with freeze well in foil baking dishes
i first made this spaghetti recipe when it came out in my first taste of home magazine it became a favorite and years later it remains so the taste is fresh and not overpowered by spaghetti sauce it39s a keeper
i have made this dish for years i like olives so i leave them out i love this dish because it taste like spaghetti just plain good
was just ok make again
this is yummy
this recipe brings such nostalgic memories when my father came to visit over 20 yrs ago we found this recipe and made it together he loved it and it became one of my favorite recipes my father has since passed away and i cant help but hold that memory dear when we cooked together i have six children and it always provided a much loved dinner i saved that old torn out recipe from the magazine so i never lost it so happy to see it is still being printed never stop sharing this recipe
this recipe is a family favorite since it appeared in the taste of home magazine back in the 90s and my go to casserole for potluck dinners many request the recipe easy to prepare as you probably have all the ingredients on hand thanks ruth koberna for this delicious recipe
this recipe has been a family favorite ever since it first appeared in taste of home in 1994 now that it39s just the two of us i bake it in two 8x8inch pans and freeze one to enjoy at a later date or share with a friend
i cut this recipe in half but used the full can of soup diluted with 14 cup water per the instructions using that amount of water the soup is too thick to 34pour34 and it really doesn39t cover the top of only half the recipe the olives and oregano give it some flavor but this casserole needs the optional beef or even sausage to make it delicious
this is a nice change from traditional spaghetti i left out the olives since my family doesn39t like them
questioncould i use my own sauce34vegetable mixture34 and use it instead of the sauce in the recipe and what does the mushroom soup add to the recipe moisture thanks for any help
very good i l doubled the amount of oregano and left out the olives nice to be able to make it ahead of time earlier in the day and baking later on for dinner
this recipe was really good i however put my on twist and substituted italian sausage for ground beef made it taste even better
the reviews were so good i couldn39t wait to make this recipe it was so bland i threw it out i just don39t understand all the great reviews i followed the recipeexcept used fresh mushrooms cooked and left out the olives it had no taste oh well
this great recipe is a 34go to34 whenever we have company i make it in the morning and put in the fridge until i39m ready to pop it in the oven i can spend more time with my guests and less time fussing in the kitch its always a hit and often requested by return guests
i have been making this recipe for many many years i take it to potlucks reunions funerals christmas parties you name it it always gets rave reviews i just made this for a church function but added pepperoni to it and everyone loved it
made this for a work function and it was an odd recipe but it was quite delicious it was a hearty meal to feed a bunch of hungry guys at first we were nervous when it was spaghetti with cream of mushroom soup but the combo actually made a delicious topping
just made this dish very tasty i would not change a thing
great recipe i used 2 cans of 14 oz rotel tomatoes instead of the 28 oz can of diced tomatoes
this is the best baked spaghetti it39s great for the family and also perfect for making for others because everyone loves it something about it tastes better every time we like it as the recipe is but it39s also good to mix sausage with the ground beef for a nice twist thanks so much for this favorite recipe
this is the ultimate comfort food anything baked spaghetti is always good
gad i love everything about the looks and sound of this can39t wait for a free night
loved it but used sausage instead of gr meat
my husband liked this recipe but i didn39t care that much for it but i used canned spaghetti sauce and a can of mushrooms so maybe had i made it according to the recipe it would have been better don39t know though as i doubt i39ll try it again
love this
my neighbor made this for me when i was in the hospital of course i had to get the recipe i love it next time i make it i39m going to try italian sausage instead of ground beef
my entire family loves this recipe it is great for multiple meals
this recipe is very good with just a few additions add salt amp pepper to taste to the ground beef then add garlic to taste add 34 cup of water to the mushroom soup that you pour over the top layer and then cover the top layer with shredded mozzarella cheese along with the parmesan i also added fresh cooked mushrooms to the meatdiced tomato mix now you go from good to great this version is tastier and more moist than original
loved it used red peppers since i had no green ones and also left out black olives would be great for a pot luck or just feeding a group of friends keeper
delicious meal good to make ahead for taking meals to people
cooked exactly as in recipe and it was delish a really different take on traditional spaghetti creamy and smooth taste
i really liked this recipe it was a nice change from tomato base i liked the mushroom soup in it
we found this to be bland and rather dry especially with next day leftovers it39s a time consuming recipe but it39s just okay tasting and not worth the effort as is i added 5 garlic cloves and some salt and pepper to the hamburger while cooking it but that extra seasoning didn39t go far enough to make this have real flavor if you like plain food then you39d like this but if i were to make it again i would use spaghetti sauce rather than diced tomatoes for sure the casserole doesn39t really have any sauce to it and the shredded cheese disappears when you bake the casserole leaving you with 2 layers of dry spaghetti noodles with some bits of diced tomato there are other spaghetti casserole recipes i would try here before this one it39s really not that good
like it very much thank you
good flavor easy prep will make again
really enjoyed this casserole my only change was adding minced garlic to the vegetable mixture and using golden mushroom soup thank you ruth and taste of home for a family favorite
this was a big hit with my family since we don39t like mushrooms i substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom soup and added pepperoni it was absolutely delightful
this is virtually identical to the chicken spaghetti recipe i39ve been making for the past 40 years chicken instead of ground beef and green stuffed olives instead of black olives it39s very good either way it39s been a staple at big family dinners for decades
one of my family39s favorite recipes i like to use spicy sausage in place of the ground beef it adds lots of flavor our guests always want the recipe
i made for a church function today and used crushed tomatoes and added another can of mushroom and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic but pretty much kept the rest the same oh substituted wine for the water and next time will definitely add wine to the sauce the bottom layer was too dry so will add sauce to the pasta before putting that layer down and before adding the burger to the sauce probably will make more sauce but all in all pretty well receivedthen again could probably be very good without layering and just mixing it all together definitely would cut prep time
i fixed this last night for supper and it was absolutely delicious i would have never thought that cream of mushroom soup on top of baked spaghetti would be good it was a big hit at my house
yum i also don39t like canned soup i make a white sauce amp add lots of mushrooms i eliminate the green peppers and olives just my preference
this was delish laholm you can use a simple white sauce flour milk butter instead of the canned soup
fabulous easy recipe and i gave it 5 stars because i copied amp printed about ten of the reviews with variations on the theme incredibly useful for the basic recipe and variations to suit my mood or the spices and meats i have on hand
this is my 1 favorite recipe that i ever found in toh magazine i made it all the time when my kids were growing up however the original recipe called for whole not diced tomatoes i don39t know why they changed it i39ve made it both ways and prefer it the way the recipe was originally written i add a little granulated garlic and i also use fresh mushrooms and saute them over medhigh heat until they get a little color ground turkey works great too love love love this recipe
this is my go to recipe for company i39ve been making it for years i do use penzys turkish oregano which i think makes the dish so tasty
i would prefer something other than canned soups your suggestions
i will try this recipe but definitely need to add garlic also i would use mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese love cheddar cheese but pasta needs garlic and mozzarella
wonderful full meal with garlic bread and salad sue
this has been our family39s favorite spaghetti dish since it first appeared in toh in 3994 can39t believe it39s been 20 years i misplaced the original paper recipe so i checked it out here thank goodness it was listed or i would be in big trouble with the family it39s easy to prep ahead of time and keep in the fridge till you39re ready to pop it in the oven avoiding the last minute dinner rush
great dinner for the family
i made this for my family tonight and this was deliciousthank you for the receipe
i will try this particular recipe but i have made one very similar and only takes 20 min on top of stove after step 1 i add one can of beef broth with the diced tomatoes i have used stewed also but i use my one hand blender to break up the tomatoes so they are not so chunky no need to add water when it comes to a boil i add uncooked bow tie pasta right into the pan about 1 12 c or so and cook for 10 min until pasta is done then add 14 c grated cheese no need to bake i don39t use cream soup or olives but every one i have made this for loves it
i have been making baked spaghetti for years umm good
longstanding family favorite lost the recipe and am glad to have found it again
i love this recipe but i put spaghetti sauce in mine we like it much better with the sauce
love this
yummy
love this recipe my mother has been making this baked spaghetti for over 20 years and now i am making it for the holiday get together
can39t believe i haven39t reviewed this before been making it for years every one enjoys it the only change i make i never buy canned mushrooms i used fresh mushrooms sliced then nuked in micro for a bit
i cannot tell you how many times i39ve made this and it is fantastic each time i do add italian sausage to the hamburger to kick up the flavor a bit
this is a good recipe the only things i did different was to omit the mushrooms and olives and instead of oregano i used italian seasoning i also used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup per another reviewer and for the tomatos i used hunts diced tomatoes with basil garlic amp oregano good flavor will make agan
wasn39t sure my husband would like it due to the mushrooms but he loved it great flavors black olives really livened it up
i39ve made this recipe so many times i39ve lost count my family loves itit39s great for family get togethers or when friends come over the only changes i made were adding the hamburger leaving out the olives and adding more cheese
i39ve made this recipe so many times i39ve lost count my family loves itit39s great for family get togethers the only changes were i added the hamburger left out the olives and added extra cheese
my family loved this dish i only had 1 small can of tomatoes so i added about 12 cup of spaghetti sauce and left out the black olives i would make it the same way next time i really liked the mushroom soup on top
absolutely amazing my family and especially my inlaws scarfed this down mind you my inlaws are 86 and 90 years old i39ve made a mexican variation of this recipe i sub39d diced green chiles for olives and mushrooms cream of chicken for cream of mushroom taco seasoning for oregano and mozzarella for parmesan cheese i cooked the pasta al dente in water with 4 tbsp low sodium chicken boullion 2 tbsp onion powder a pinch of kosher salt never table salt for cooking and 1 tbsp olive oil i used 12 can of the noodle broth to dilute the cream of chicken soup the hot water helped blend the soup quickly and evenlyplus the water was already flavored this is a definite make again hot dish bon appetite
i liked this because i felt it was a little different than the typical baked spaghetti casserole my boyfriend said he would have liked it better with more tomatoes i personally like the cream of mushroom sauce on the top and wouldn39t change it if it were for just me
i have been making this many years iest is my favorite baked spaghetti and my family loves it also with no changes as good reheated
i made this recipe because of all of the great reviews i39m not sure if i would make it again because i felt it was just ok
used this recipe for the first time for a christmas party this year i knew there was going to be a crowd so i doubled the recipeit made a huge amount the baked spaghetti was the hit of the party we didn39t bring one bit home did increase the amount of cheese i mixed the cheese into the spaghetti before putting it in the baking dish really spread the cheesy around nicely love love love this recipe the family has been begging me to make it again already
love this dish always make 2 pans 1 with pasta and the other with spaghetti squash cut open remove seeds ect then rub with cut garlic and olive oilbake about 45 minwhen cooled scrape out 34noodles34 we all actually like the squash better plus it39s diabetic and figure friendly i mix soup in with sauce cause it39s easier and tastes fine try this you39ll love it
i cook for bingo and i have made this several times everyone loves it and it39s easy to make i have also made it several times for my family they also think it39s super delicious i do add salt and pepper i triple the recipe and make homemade bread
i have been using this recipe for a long time it is so good if you39re in a hurry you can skip the onion amp green pepper amp burger as well as use spaghetti sauce although it tastes best following the recipe as stated
i used italian sausage instead of ground beef it was really good makes a lot
have been making this toh recipe to rave reviews for years it is my go to recipe when i make baked spaghetti making it tomorrow for my husband to share with his coworkers
i have been making this for years it is the best everyone loves it
i added some italian seasoning garlic powder salt amp pepper for a bit more flavor i cooked my beef and vegetables in olive oil for all i believe that all italian dishes must have olive oil also added it to the spaghetti water it needed about 1 12 cans mushroom soup and another 18 cup water i felt that it was a little dry so i willtry adding more tomatoes to it next time took this to a church dinner and still got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe
not bad it came out a little plain and had no taste i followed the recipe without any changes i would add more salt and seasonings before baking this dish i added seasonings and hot sauce to this after i noticed it had no taste and it eas then edible and i didn39t mind it but my husband barely touched his plate so i wouldn39t make this again
i must say this was absolutely delicious i made mine with whole wheat spaghetti ground turkey and followed the rest of the recipe to a tee i will be making this again thanks for sharing
unexpectedly good i was a bit skeptical mushroom soup but i trusted what the reviewers said gave it a try really good my fatherinlaw and husband both had three helpings i did change a couple things yellow pepper instead of green and fresh mushroom instead of canned since this is what i had i also left out the meat to keep it vegetarian i also assembled everything the night before and then popped it into the oven for dinner which made things that much easier on a busy mom i will be making this again
my first time baking spaghetti and absolutely in love with this meal hubby and kids loved it and would like me to make this again soon i used a bigger can of mushroom and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom love love love this recipe
this is the 1 favorite of my son so i make it often the whole family loves it we cannot eat bell pepper so i omit them
i make this recipe often and everyone loves it including the grandkids i even make it for bunco getting raves over it the only addition i make is a very small can of tomato sauce when i add the diced tomatoes it39s so delicious and comforting love this recipe
this very recipe came out in 1995 and i have used it many times since everyone loves it
i have been making this for years it is one of my families favorites i make it often for company for something different and it always gets rave reviews don39t let the different ingredients detour you it is a flavor combo that is unexpected delicious and packed full of veggies
i have made this recipe several time my soninlaw says this is the best it39s very good
very good although i made it without olives don39t care for them also made a side portion without meat for the vegetarian everyone enjoyed it
this is one of the most delicious dinners we have had it freezes well too
i started making this recipe in 1994 when i first saw it in a taste of home magazine i have found none to compare to this version of baked spaghetti everyone that tries it wants the recipe this recipe is not a traditional tomato based type but is rather creamy with enough oregano to give it that special ooomph 18 years is a long time to make a recipe it39s definitely a keeper this makes quite a bit i fed my growing family of four way back in 1994 and had leftovers for several days now i make it in its full recipe but freeze much of it so that i can have it later i don39t add the cheese to the top of the frozen ones until ready to bake this recipes freezes beautifully
i have made this a few times now i have made a few adjustments i add only 1 can of tomatoes also i add garlic salt and mrs dash spicey seasoning 2 tsps each to the mixture when i add the oregano i also add a little paprika to the cream if mushroom sauce before i spread the soup over the casserole i feel this adds enough extra spice to give it alot of taste everyone in my home loves this dish
this was the first recipe i ever tried from taste of home back in 1994 it has been a family favorite i can34t begin to tell you the number of times i have made it or the number of recipes i have given out the only thing i do differently is instead of diced tomatoes i use crushed my family does not like big chunks of tomatoes
i made this recipe when it was first published 1994 and it has been a favorite since that time on occasion i have used rotini instead of spaghetti especially when taking for something special
i make this every fall for my guys to take to hunting camp it39s their opening night tradition fillingand feeds lots leftovers are greatif there are any
i made this recipe about two weeks ago and my husband raved about it it makes quite a bit so we refridged the remainder reheated it next day at lunch and took the rest to our pastor and wife who were travelling everyone was delighted with it tonight i am making it again for family that is coming to dinneri did do one extra item for this meal though i added a can of hunt39s spaghetti sauce with the tomatoes and about a 14 of a teaspoon of thyme to boot mmmmm good stuff this
family favorite
love love love this recipe one of my favorite recipies
fairly easy to make and rather tasty we all went in for seconds on this one
very dry too much spaghetti not much flavor wouldn39t make this again i39ll stick with my regular spaghetti recipe not work the effort
i made this for the first time last weekend my husband and i really enjoyed it i will definitely make this again
this recipe is a family and friend pleaser my husband adores this recipe and friends can39t get enough
i39ve made this taste of home recipe for yearsi do add garlicand the mushroom soup adds a little extra something to it always get compliments and recipe requests
i made this spaghetti for my family earlier this year and they loved it my daughter isn39t wild about traditional spaghetti sauce so this recipe caught my attention because it only has the canned tomatoes in it i have since made this for my church wednesday night family dinner feeding approx 125 people and have had nothing but great reviews i did add a few additional ingredients fresh garlic salt amp pepper red peppers in addition to the green and i mix 1 cup 5 blend italian cheese with the cheddar cheese
i thought this was pretty goodadded garlic cause i think spaghetti has to have garlic lol
tried this at home for a different twist on the normal spaghetti and my family loved it i did add garlic powder and salt other than that it was perfect i also cook for my church weekly so since it was a hit at home i made it for 125 church members with received great reviews
we just didn39t care for the taste with the cream of mushroom soup it was just weird way to much work for something thats edible but not worth making agian
we love this spaghetti dish no it39s not like traditional spaghettiwithsauce dishes not as spicily seasoned but in it39s own right it39s a delicious dish i love the addition of the black olives in it
my mom started using this recipe years ago and it remains a favorite recipe wonderful flavor easy to make will remain a favorite family loves it
this is a easy to make recipe and my 6 yr old daughter ate it all up although she wasn39t to fond of the mushrooms but that39s an easy change will make again
i have been making this recipe since first published it is our favorite way for spaghetti have never used meat in it sometimes use the homrmade casserole mix for the mushroom soup and only one 14 oz can of tomatoes great leftovers too
i am new to this website and wow i made this recipe this week and my husband absolutely loved it due to what i had in my pantry i subbed spaghetti sauce and it turned out very yummy thank you so much for such an easy and delicious recipe
the review process asked if i39d make this recipe again and my answer is yes yes and yes my husband was never one to enjoy spaghetti with a meat sauce but when a friend served us this recipe he changed his mind about spaghetti it39s been years now since we first enjoyed it and it39s something that everyone i39ve ever served raves about i39ve taken it to my church pot luck dinners on many occasions followed by passed out many requested copies of the recipe thanks ruth koberna and taste of home for this wonderful recipejoyce halliseymt gilead nc
i love this recipe i have one exactly the same cut from toh mag probably 15 years ago i leave off the peppers amp i have made it with sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef amp used crushed tomatoes instead of the diced i use a mixture of cheddar amp mozzarella awesome serves well amp freezes well even in individual containers
i made this with keilbasa and no green peppers or mushroomsit was wonderful
we loved this i really liked the addition of the cream of mushroom soup my dh who hates anything that contains cream of anything soup even loved it
i followed the recipe with just a few changes i used a 14 oz can of diced tomates subsituted angel hair pasta for the spaghetti and mixed in some paprika to the mushroom soup before pouring it over the casserole i made this but was not expecting much i was surprised it was delicious my husband loved it will definately make again
for all the work this recipe takes it is so not worth it i had to dump it all back into a big skillet and add spaghetti sauce and spices to give it flavor so i didn39t have to eat the bland original definitely not worth it
blech
great recipe for a different taste try the 34mushroom soup with roasted garlic34 also delicious
i have made this since 1994 i always have request for recipe
we loved iteverything on handeasy to make
i have been making this since 1994 it39s a favorite for the whole family and others who have it here for dinner ask for the recipe
tried and true for years aa
excellent recipe serves a large number of people and freezes well my family loves it
pmy husband and i really enjoyed this baked spaghetti my only change i made was to leave out the olives because we aren39t fans of them next time to appeal more to the kids i will likely used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because they turned their noses up at the 34tomato chunks34 and be sure to dice up the peppers smaller than i didp
this is a taste of home classic that goes way back i39ve made it meatless for the vegetarians in my life but i personally like it better with the meat i always use chopped olives not the sliced it makes fabulous leftoverswhich is good because i will eat it every day until it39s gone i like to bring this casserole in a disposable foil container when i need a meal to give to a family if you enjoy casseroles this is the jackpot
made this recipe manymany timesnever added meat always made meatless husband39s all time favoritegreat lenten recipe
everyone loves this recipe i make a dish of it for my family and a dish for a friend it39s a great hearty twist on spaghetti
family favorite for years
tried this for the 1st time and will have to make it again to keep everybody happy everyone really enjoyed it
this is soooooooo good
my family didn39t care much for this recipe
delicious recipe was given to me by a lady i work with and she got it from taste of home
this is one of only a few recipes that i repeat constantly my husband loves it and will take leftovers to his buddies for lunch
i have been making this since the first issues of taste of home its a great recipe
i made this for the first time when i had company over and everyone loved it this is a great recipe thanks for sharing
i also have been making this recipe since 1994 my daughter now grown makes this for her familyher kids now ask her to make it
have been making this since it was in the magazine in 94 its a great recipe
love this i have 5 kids so i am always looking for recipe39s that freeze well both my husband and i could not tell at all that this had been frozen it tasted as though i had just made it very yummy and although i have only made it for company twice both have asked for the recipe kids like it too
i got this recipe out of the taste of home magazine probably more than 15 years ago and it is still a favorite of mine and my family i always get requests for the recipe i make it all the time for new mothers and when i take food for the families when someone passes away because it is easy and everyone loves it i keep the olives out and the kids love it too
we39ve love this recipe for years too i39ve made it so many times mainly to make 2 square pans so i can put one in the freezer
tried so many corn bread recipes out there and this one is the best one by far so happy i found this recipe if you have a few extra minutes this recipe is worth making
have now made this cornbread recipe at least 20 times over the past couple years it is an absolute favorite of my family and some lucky friends when i serve it with any kind of soup especially my kielbasa and kale soup deelish
i loved the sweetness of this cornbread and it was great fresh right out of the oven we ate ours with butter and syrup just like when i was a kid
i just made this and had a small piece of it and it is very good it came out a little bit drybut that could be my faultas i have never made any kind of corn breadand had it in the oven a little longerbecause my toothpick came out wet will i make this again absolutely i also creamed the butter sugar for exactly 7 minutes until it was a nice pale yellow color
best corn bread ever love the simple ingredient list we like them as muffins
to much flour not enough cornmeal
i like this recipe easy to make and tasty i made a few changes used pamala39s gluten free baking flour instead of sugar i used ½ cup monk fruit sweetener and cut the butter to ½ cup it baked up really nice i think i will put some corn kernels in next time
this is delicious corn bread i care what you want to call it thanks nicole
the buttery flavor and soft crumb is wonderful i always cut the sugar by half or more since my diet can39t tolerate all of that but give this a try
love this cornbread best recipe i39ve found been using it for awhile
love this cornbread followed recipe added just a little more milk because i thought the batter was a bit thick
very good i switch between this recipe
can this be made with sugar substitute
have not tried yet but had to commend frances for the best comment i have ever read on a review so so true to each his own and let others enjoy or not without your opinion of what they like
okso i thought this was very good and from virginia decided that i like cornbread at all but love corn cake instead we all have different tastes and found as gotten older that food i thought was good as a kid really that great
thank you nicole for sharing what looks like a yummy recipe i am looking forward to making exactly like your recipe stated
great recipe and my whole family loved it
i am a new englander we39ve been making cornbread corn cakes johnny cakes and indian pudding using corn since the time of the pilgrims no way is corn bread a one region baked good just like chili barbecue sauce and pizza vary from state to state region to region so does cornbread there39s no right or wrong way to make it it39s what you grew up with what your grandma made and what you came to love nowhere does this recipe claim to be 34southern34 cornbread or 34northern34 cornbread make your cornbread however you like just don39t tell me my way is wrong
i thought this was excellent i live in the deep south and cannot understand the love for the dry unsweet variety that is so prevalent here they don39t call this southern cornbread so the folks who are up in arms about this not being 34real southern cornbread34 should back off must be my northern roots but this is some of the best cornbread i39ve had and it makes a nice large pan of it too warms up great i found it sweet yes but not excessively so
my family is a huge fan of cornbread
very good and sweet cornbread perfect with spicy main dishes
this definitely is yummy but i do have to say it will be named corncake with a slash in my recipe file i do wonder if people saying cornbread from the south is dry is because of 1 in the north they rarely use real good olebacon grease and real buttermilk so this is1 2 most southerners that i grew up with counted on eating a slice from a castiron skillet the best way to stay moist and have a crispy crust
the best cornbread recipe i39ve ever had i made several copies so i can always find it easily
just a recommendationi would add to the name 34sweet34 buttery cornbread i like looking at
corn bread is like pizza there39s no right or wrong
first time having cornbread and i loved it recipe was very easy to follow i did reduce the sugar to 3tbsp as i was serving it with stew this scottish girl loved the finished result
great basic recipe i39m having mine with super spicy chili thank you
very good flavor and texture easy to make nice sweet flavor will make again
my husband and i had this with a big pot of ham and beans it adjust enough sweetness it is a big recipe13x9 so next time probably cut in half it tasted really good with the beans on the coldest night this year
excellent recipe to all the 34southerner34 commentors get over yourselves it is a matter of taste
i made it it was easy to make and i liked the buttery smooth texture and flavor it complimented my 15 bean soup very well do i prefer corn bread without sugar depends on what mood i39m in and what i39m eating it with if i were having it with greens i39d probably prefer the old fashioned no sugar cornbread
this is how my husband makes his neighborhood famous cornbread except he substitutes the last four ingredients for a package of jiffy cornbread mix he also only adds three tablespoons of sugar rather than a full cup half a cube of butter one egg 1 teaspoon of oil and it turns out great everyone loves it so easy he also uses whole milk
i was curious about this recipe 1 cup sugar no way was i going to use that much sugar personally i will go back to my 1 cup cornbreadflour ratio as family likes my old standby better but i find it interesting to try new cornbread recipes
this is the best cornbread ever i am a northerner but my husband is not and he says it can39t be beat i do substitute buttermilk for the milk but that is the only change i make like others have said it is very moist and does freeze well and if you have never had it with syrup give it a try you might like it
i am a southern cook born and bred if i added sugar to cornbread my sainted mother would be spinning in her grave also buttermilk is essential in my cornbread world however with all that written i have to say if this sounds good to youtry it if you like it then i am happy for you and i respect your opinion there is too much derision among us already to each his own in cornbread and in life god bless us everyone
so good try it
if you let your batter sit for around 20 min you will not have grainy corn bread
i made this exact recipe and it was too grainy and falling apart and too sweet it wasn39t horrible but it39s not great corn bread either
great sweet corn bread recipe made it twice sticking to original recipe it does make a large amount so i froze a few pieces in freezer bags and used them during the rest of the week you can defrost them or they reheat well in the microwave just a minute or less for a couple of pieces this recipe is very much like the krusteaz honey cornbread mix i usually buy if you like sweet cornbread definitely want to try this
love this recipe it39s the best cornbread i have had it39s better than the one they sell at whole foods most of the cornbreads i have had are dry this won is kind of sweet and you can cut down on the sugar i also used skim milk
i made this recipe gluten free the other night and it was very good even my wheateating husband said it was quite good and had several pieces i39m making it again tonight yes the texture is much lighter and 34fluffier34 than traditional cornbread but for someone allergic to wheat it was really nice to get a soft light bread that i can eatif anyone is interested i converted it by using my usual glutenfree flour and increasing the egg and baking powder a bit i did cut it to a quarterrecipe for the two of us and i baked it in a terra cotta bread dish which gave it a nice crispy outside with a light soft inside and as my husband noted kept it warm at the table too i used2 34 tbsp softened butter14 cup sugar1 large egg 1 egg white38 cup plus 1 tbsp milk12 cup plus 1 tbsp glutenfree flour14 cup cornmeal1 12 tsp baking powder14 tsp salt
my significant other is in a marine corps league he is in charge of their annual fundraiser which is a ham amp bean amp cornbread supper four years ago we started making the cornbread for this event since we were to be serving masses i searched for a traditional recipe that would make more than an 8x8 pan i came across this and we got great reviews the event has grown and several people have requested that we use the same recipe i have not heard a single complaint i just finished making 90 9x13 pans and by the way it freezes well
i cannot wait to try this however i would like to know what type of cornmeal this recipe calls for there is corn flour which i do not believe is the correct ingredient because it clearly doesn39t say 34corn flour34 but there is also fine grind medium grind and coarse grind each of which will produce a completely different result i39m a freespirit when it comes to cooking but baking requires a different approach i39m astounded that 144 people have had wonderful results while i39m still trying to figure out which type of cornmeal to use i39ve read all the comments and have only seen one reference to grind priscilla saying coarse grind may have made it grittier thank you priscilla so i39m thinking medium or fine and leaning towards fine can anyone who has tried this weigh in thanks
we all loved it it had a wonderful flavor and great consistency very moist i used a very coarse corn meal which i think i39ll get a finer one next time but that39s a small thing it just made it a bit gritter than i would have liked didn39t affect the flavor at all
theeee best i39ve ever eaten
made this recipe with two changesi used 14 cup of sugar and cooked it in an iron skillet according to my husband it was the best cornbread he had ever eaten so moist and delicious this will be my go to recipe from now on
i39ve used this recipe for years with rave reviews today i wanted to try making it in muffin pan so i appreciate the comments from those who have
absolutely wonderful flavor i added a small handful of chopped pickled jalapenos and some cheddar cheese for a little kick will definitely be making this one again
excellent as is
very good
just made this recipe this morning exactly as written i cut the recipe in half and made 6 large muffins as someone else had done as it39s just 2 of us baked for 18 minutes and they came out great yummy
i made this to go with easter ham dinner everyone enjoyed it but mine was very dense not light and fluffy like some have stated still very enjoyable and moist the next day
dlboylan as long as you use a cup for cup replacement it should turn out fine
would it be alright to replace the ap flour with a glutenfree flour blend will it still produce desired results
i39m from the south and don39t put any sugar in cornbread so i made it without and it was really good my mother always used some hot bacon grease in hers
yum i cut back a little on the sugar and it was still plenty sweet
made as directed and was very good
great cornbread recipe it39s a keeper
this is the most delicious cornbread i have ever ate this cornbread stays moist and is awesome with anything mmmmm good
definite make again i made only half the batter since there were only 3 of us eating it i made 6 large muffins and baked about 18 minutes they were so tender and slightly sweet yum
a good recipe bakes up light and fluffy but the next time i make it i will decrease the sugar by half sweet so depending on how you use it or what you pair it with may determine how sweet you like it
very good moist not overly sweet light made 12 recipe and put into muffin cupcake paper cups only baked for 19 min i will be making this again i will not be using the recipe on the cornmeal package ever again
great cornbread moist buttery sweet some southerners think they own the making of good cornbread but they don39t there39s nothing wrong with sweet cornbread i39ve had cornbread with no sugar baked in a skillet with bacon fat and it39s nothing to brag about this recipe is now my go to recipe when i39m making cornbread two thumbs up add some jam and i39ll fight ya for it
as a new bride i made corn bread amp then asked myself 34why34 it was dry amp tasteless so over the years i tried others amp didn39t change my mind when i saw this in toh in 2002 amp tried it it was just what i was looking for so have used it for years my children amp grandchildren love it as well as others when i take it to potlucks i don39t change anything
this is sooo good it39s perfectly light and fluffy it39s the best cornbread i39ve made it39s really not a 34cake34 as some said as cakes have equal parts sugar and flour ie 2 c sugar to 2 c flour comforting on a cold drizzling winter day
made this as 18 muffins will put some in the freezer to see how they do
i normally eat healthy but every once in a while i will treat myself to some good 39ole fashion home cooking this cornbread recipe i awesome i made a pot of greens usi5n this cornbread recipe and felt like 8 was eating corncread cake yummmmmyyyyyy
so not the healthiest corn bread recipe but it39s so goodthis is my go to corn bread now i have reduced the sugar to 34 cup a few times it was still fine
excellent very moist my husband tried it and said 34i think i like cornbread now34 many recipes are too dry but not this one
this isn39t cornbreadmore like cake but then i39m from the south
easy to make but too sweet for our taste i39m going to try making it again using less sugar
this is my youngest son39s favorite corn bread it39s so fluffy and light honey butter is good on this bread
should have read other reviews before making it seemed like a version jiffy cake mixvery similar
i made this recipe tonightit was devinei couldn39t believe how moist it was just deliciousi have to say it was a bit sweet i will try with 12 cup sugar next timeoverall amazingits a keeper
excellent corn bread very moist you do have to dirty a lot of dishes though
deleted all other cornbread recipes
great recipe always a dinner winner
this recipe deserves four stars it is the only corn bread recipe i baked amp served in both of my restaurant journeys moist deliciousamp flavorful thankyou for this awesome recipe ginger meeder
wow i have used this recipe since i first found it years ago in a taste of home magazine my family loves this especially when i use it as a complement to my chili
i39ve been making this recipe for well over 15 years we love it it39s on the sweet side i39ve tried decreasing the sugar for my husband but i think he just prefers my skillet cornbread like his mom makes i39ve tried other recipes but i always return to this one for the rest of my family yum
very tasty i made this to accompany a large batch of chili for casual gathering they gobbled it up and asked for the recipe i served it with honey on the sideyum i think it was enjoyed so much because it is a bit different than the typical corn bread i did decrease the sugar to 23 cup as suggested by others but that was the only recipe change
i love this recipe real crowd pleaser made my day with my dressing mmmmmmmmm i39ll do it again
pretty good came out golden brown and served it as a side dish with red beans and rice i used skim milk but otherwise followed directions next time i would decrease the sugar a little bit maybe 34 cup but otherwise no changes makes plenty
best cornbread ever if you39re from the north you39ll love it as is if ya39ll are from the south decrease the sugar to 23 or even 12 a cup then sit back and prepare to enjoy the benefits of the most delicious buttery cornbread your mouth has ever tasted oh happy day
very good corn bread
i used half the sugar so it wasn39t overly sweet for me but it39s corn meal white flour ratio is off i think it tasted more like a yellow cake than corn bread to me not great as a corn bread
pretty good i followed recommendations to use melted butter cut the sugar amp used buttermilk i also made it 5050 flour to cornmeal amp soaked the cornmeal to eliminate any gritty taste one thing i usually do to up the flavor is to add pureed corn but i didn39t have time next time
way to much sugar for me this is more like cake just needs strawberries and whipped cream
to me the cornbread is pretty dense and cake like as some of the other reviews mention it is also very sweet too a little too sweet for me good flavor and i don39t regret making just not what i look for in my cornbread if i make again i39ll cut down the amount of sugar if you like your cornbread really sweet and cake like this is the recipe for you
very good recipe its my go to now
i just love this cornbread i served it during a get together at my home and everyone had positive comments and just loved it i did change a few things 1 substituted 1 cup flour with 1 cup cornmeal 2 only used 34 cup sugar 3 substituted 2 milk with butter milk 3 did not cream butter with sugar melted butter and added sugar and the directions where the same through out the procedures i discovered that if you cream butter with sugar it will be more of a cake than cornbread same as substituting 1 cup cornmeal for 1 cup flour you can try this if you want more of a bread texture than a cake still it39s an excellent recipe enjoy

this recipe makes the best cornbread my husband and i have ever tasted
this was a great recipe i used a 9x9 pan because i didn39t have the size asked for baked it about ten minutes longer really a great simple recipe
i absolutely love this recipe i have been using it for years i usually make 2double batches at a time i make muffins and mini cornbread loafs sooooo good don39t be afraid to go a little light on the sugar i usually do about 34 cup or so i found a great way to make it slightly more healthy when doing a double batch i do 2 cups all purpose 2 cups whole wheat flour and then i split the remaining 23 cups between chia seeds and flax meal if it39s too wet i just add all purpose flour 1tbsp at a time you won39t be disappointed also make sure all ingredients are room temperature it mixes so much more smoothly enjoy

excellent tasting and easy to make mine turned out gooey in the middle even with an extra 10 minutes of baking time but i39ll just be more careful next time tasted great
very easy and very tasty thanks for sharing it
i followed the recipe as is it is the best corn bread i39ve had it is not overly grainy i39m am very pleased and will keep this recipe
i swapped out the milk for vanilla yogurt sooo good
tastes even better than the krusteaz box mix it39s the best recipe i39ve tasted
excellent moist not gritty just yummyeven the batter is delicious
this was my first attempt at homemade corn bread since we39ve been married my husband and our dinner guest loved it this is definately a keeper
i have used this recipe for years i bring this cornbread to family gettogethers and it goes quickly it is not gritty dry or grainy the children in the family particularly love it and insist that their parents ask for the recipe i suspect that they like it because it is a sweet and moist cornbread i like pairing it with a spicy chili
very delicious one of the best corn breads i39ve ever made
i accidentally forgot the flour but it still came out very good i loved how moist and buttery it was and my kids love it i39m going to make more today and remember the flour this time we liked it with the 1 cup of sugar
great recipe
i cut the sugar to 34 cup i would not do that again it was not sweet enough i would also swape one cup flour for one cup cornmeal
this recipe is delicious it39s like cornbread and cake in one i made the exact recipe but in muffin form we ate them up will make again
very good i took the advice of previous comments and lowered the sugar to 34 cup either than that the texture sweetness and everything was perfect
i made this recipe to accompany a family beef and vegetable soup it was the perfect combo of salty and sweet as other reviewers mentioned it is very cakelike i tasted the batter before pouring it into the baking dish and found it to be too sugary i added 14 cup of milk to tone it down and it was just right when it was done next time i39ll do 34 cup of sugar instead of a whole cup but otherwise definitely a goto recipe even my picky fiance loved it
this is the best corn bread i have found i only make this one my kids always as for it whenever corn bread is needed my oldest daughter will not eat corn bread if she know i didn39t make it it is a great start for corn bread dressing
i have made this cornbread several times my family loves it and it39s very easy to makeelkton maryland
this is a delicious cakelike cornbread we like it better with less sugar about 12 cup
great recipe very moist and it has a wonderful flavour compared to other 34bland34 corn bread recipes we39ve tried definitely a keeper we39ll use over and over
have made this many times over the years tried and true our favorite cornbread recipe
this was a huge hit with my family
the absolute best and most moist cornbread ever
this is a very good and moist cornbread really liked the flavor only thing is too much flour causing it to have too much of a 34cake34 texture next time i make this i think i will add less flour and more cornmeal overall a very good cornbreadbetter than any other recipe i39ve tried
i have used this recipe exclusively since the 2002 taste of home recipe book was delivered we always have this with ham 39n beans
i have made this many times for my family my kids love this we refer to it as 34corncake34 because it is so delicious it reminds me of what is served at marie calender39s restaurant
i39ve been looking for a good corn bread recipe i39ve tried several others but nothin compares to this one i added chopped jalepeno for the hubby though all in all 5 stars oh don39t forget to spread butter
my family loved this one
this cornbread is a mazing my whole family loves this recipe it39s the only one i39ll make
the only cornbread i make so moist and buttery it puts traditional cornbread to shame
this is my standard corn bread recipe too we prefer it a little less sweet so i decreased the sugar to 23 c and that works well for us
i39ve never heard of putting syrup on corn bread it does sound good though
this has became the only recipe i use for cornbread it is fantastic i love it with honey or maple syrup
wonderful so moist and flavorful a big hit with christmas dinner
so good always a hit at our house really good with pint beans or slow cooked chili
this is the best chocolate cake ever i don39t have room in my oven for three 934 pans so i bought a pair of 834 fat daddio pans that are 334 deep i use a very light coating of wilton39s cake release and wrap my pans to keep the layers evenly baked i split the full recipe between the two pans and baked them at 350 for 45 minutes perfect layers i like the icing recipe on the back of the hershey39s cocoa powder container it spreads beautifully and stays soft and creamy for the life of the cake you can even pipe decorations with it this cake never fails to please
excellent chocolate cake light tender layers with the right taste of chocolate easy to make in 9 inch layers or cut recipe in half and make 6 inch layers thank you sandy
i made this gluten and dairy free by substituting a gluten free all purpose blend flour and adding xanthan gum used dairy free sour cream and earth balance stick butter also substituted german chocolate for the semisweet the cakes were very moist and stuck to the cooling racks a bit but overall it worked just fine my dairyallergic son said he was surprised at how good it was being gluten free it was his birthday cake and was unsure at first about having it gf but he had 2 pieces
i made this cake 3 times every time it became a german chocolate cake as i added a thin layer of homemade coconut pecan goo between each layer and on the top this was the very best german chocolate cake ever nobody could put their forks down my sister owns a bakery and she asked for the recipe said it was the best she has ever had a huge compliment i will make it again
this is the most amazing cake have made it several timesno wonder an award winner
this cake is fantastic however the frosting is missing an ingredient my frosting is really thin it39s not as thick as in the video like another reviewer wrote the frosting ingredients are incomplete please help
so i really liked this cake a lot however i totally forgot to add the water i completely missed it i really just thought the water was in the ingredients to melt the chocolateduh my fault so for those of you that made brownies like methis is probably whylol
this message is for the lady who39s family does not like mayo or some of the other ingredients and is worried how the sour cream looked in the finished cake you will in no way taste those ingredients in the finished cake they are used for volume moisture and texture this cake should taste wonderful this recipe is quite similar to how a red velvet cake would be made i have an award winning chocolate cake recipe from good housekeeping magazine that used vinegar for the rising agent and you would never in a million years believe that the cakes is made with vinegar try the recipe your family will love this cake
this is one of my favorite chocolate cakes and really easy to make
this is my 4th year in a row baking this cake it is outstanding forget to add boiling water or boiling coffee as your last step to making the batter easy to read past it in the directions this is my favorite chocolate cake and my husband loves having it every year on his birthday also his favorite
i made this and took it to a party and everybody seemed to like it i have not tried it nor has my family because none of us like mayo cream cheese or sour cream i have made a chocolate cream cheese frosting that i was able to eat but i was unsure of the sour cream in this recipe can anybody tell me how noticeable it is otherwise the cake looks just delicious
this is my new go to chocolate cake it is just right kind of a milk chocolate flavor not a deep devils food chocolate just a regular chocolate cake but excellent flavor and moistness
wow i would love to try this cake please post the ingredients in metrics measurements do i can bake this beauty tia
so scrumptious just what you expect from a chocolate cake will make it again
this was a very good cake i halved the recipe and baked it in 2 rounds since there is only two of us and i want cake hanging around too long it came out perfect i had never heard of making frosting with sour cream it was delicious not sweet like most this will now be my only chocolate frosting i use thanks for the recipe
this recipe was amazing i used a separate recipe for the frosting because i wanted a lighter color but the cake itself was very moist and delicious
absolutely delicious and relatively easy to make my husband was in awe of the big beautiful threelayer cake for his birthday declaring it the best he39d ever had i am not a big fan of cake but i thought this one was really delicious
best chocolate cake ever printed it and taped it inside my kitchen cupboard
i recently took this cake to a dinner with friends it got rave reviews as it was pretty and very moist the frosting was good but not icky sweet will keep this one for sure
not a fan of this cake was quite dense and tasted like dark chocolate with all brown sugar and cocoa the frosting was excellent
i didn39t want to make a 3layer cake so i cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 934 x 734 pyrex pan for about 25 minutes and it turned out perfectly the cake is very good the frosting was creamy and thick but perhaps just a little bit too sweet but overall a greattasting cake
this is a delicious cake but i have difficulty getting the layers out of pans intact and frosting it because so delicate what am i doing wrong
i only have two 81234 pans how do i adjust the ingredients and will it look bad with 2 tiers
this is my newest favorite cake delicious i did make 125x the frosting so i could really load up the entire cake with extra frosting yum
the best cake will make again
this cake is everything sandy said it was worth the effort it has become my 34go to34 when i need an impressive cake for a special occasion
i have a feeling the people who did not get a rise in the cake used baking powder instead of baking soda
wowthis cake is amazing i followed the instructions pretty closely except i used brewed coffee instead of boiling water i also added a raspberry filling between the layers it was one of the best cakes i39ve ever made this is definitely my new goto chocolate cake
excellent i put black currant jam between the layers as well you only need a small piece i will make this again janet vfe
the very best and now the only chocolate cake i make there is no better
this was the best chocolate cake i39ve ever made it was a hit with rave reviews this is my go to chocolate cake love it
wow is right a beautiful tall moist dense chocolate cake with wonderful rich chocolate frosting to die for the frosting was just the right consistency to hide a small crack in one of the layers the cake is going to my church homecoming tomorrow i39ll be lucky to bring home a crumb or two
question i only have 934x1334 cake pans does anyone know if this can be baked the same way
wow i made this cake for the 4th of july what39s more american than chocolate cake right and it was a grand slam home run with everyone i made the recipe exactly as stated except i added a generous dash of cinnamon to the batter with the other dry ingredients the cake came out exactly like it looks in the picture on the website it is so delicious i can39t stop eating it it39s dense i love dense cakes as opposed to light and airy spongy cakes super moist and full of chocolate flavor the frosting pairs perfectly with the cake the recipe made three full size 9 inch layers i just wrapped one layer in plastic wrap and foil and put it in the freezer for another day the frosting was more than enough to generously frost two layers and then have about a cup leftover at first i was stumped because i never heard of 34leftover frosting34 before not in my house this frosting recipe left enough leftover for us spoonlovingfrostingeating adults and more for another time i bet i could even frost 12 dozen cupcakes with the leftover frosting so to sum it up if you love rich chocolately moist dense cake with tangy sweet chocolately frosting of which you will have some leftover then make this cake thank you for sharing sandy this cake recipe deserves that winning ribbon
i have made this cake many times it always come out perfectly and i always get rave reviews the people having problems probably follow directions baking is a science if you exact in your measurements and use the right size pan it work
frosting 12 cup butter recipe stops whats the rest of ingredients
excellent cake and icing super moist and flavourful cake and icing is perfect consistency i bake mine in 2ea 934 round pans so i could do 4 thinner layers as a professional chef not pastry but still i would say this is the best cake recipe i have found anywhere if you want to go beyond the box cake mix and try something a little bit more challenging look no further
best chocolate cake ever made it for easter and got rave reviews from some very picky people made my caramel frosting instead of the chocolate couldn39t be happier with the outcome thanks taste of home
love this chocolate cake normally a die hard yellow cake fan however my childrens bday coming up
mmmmmmmm this cake was so good and fluffy and soft it was amazing i put a raspberry frosting between the layers and frosted the outside with chocolate icing i only had about 23 cup sour cream and was out of yogurt so i substituted a tablespoon or two of cream cheese and filled up the rest with milk odd but it worked well i also only had 3 eggs so i used 2 tbs of water with 2 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of canola oil thank you internet i baked it for 23ish minuted and it was cooked thoroughly thank you for this recipe it was amazing
this made a large cake 3 big layers and it was very good very intensely chocolate the frosting was decadent i am going to use it on other cakes that call for chocolate frosting recommend this recipe
absolutely loved this cake when is was in toh magazine a few back made it that christmas and im making it again
the full jampacked chocolate cake just took my heart away amazing recipe
i made it for my grandma39s birthday i have never heard so many compliments in my life even one of my older sisters who doesn39t like chocolate she had a piece and told me that it was the only kind of chocolate that tasted good i had never felt so honored i39m planning on making it on this oncoming christmas for the rest of my family but this is the best cake that i have ever made lt3
i just want to say that 34shirley34 and 34vsailaway34 are wrong this recipe is hands down the best chocolate cake recipe i39ve ever used the three cups brown sugar is not too much for a cake of this volume my cake has always come out great the only thing i change is i use cake flour softassilk brand
i haven39t made it but three cups of brown sugar really i39ve always thought the one on the cocoa can was excellent wouldn39t make this one
three cups of brown sugar is this a typo i just threw this cake in the trash it boiled over in the oven it fell apart i am an experienced cake baker not making this again it tasted like pure sugar
i39ve made this cake many time and i love it i can see why it won first prize
fabulous flavor and texture i love baking this cake and everyone loves eating this cake i have a favorite chocolate buttercream icing i use but this cake recipe is the best thank you sandy
sandy is known as an excellent cook her cake always comes out great way to go sandy
i was highly disappointed in the icing because i went exactly by the recipe and when i finished it it tasted more like sour cream and confectioners sugar i didnt enjoy it i wanted more a chocolate taste
is it normal for the cake to boil in the oven baking it right now and boiling if this turns out good then i will rate it
i tried to make this cake but for some reason i ended up making brownies i literally have no idea how this happened from the other reviews it seems like a good cake so i might just have to try again at least i have a good recipe for brownies now1 for finished product5 for how funny it was when i took the brownies out of the oven
tis cake is so like my aunt39s scratch cake but quicker for the person who said it wasn39t chocolatey enough try replacing the water with strong coffee i do this for most chocolate bake goods and people always mention the flavor being kicked up a notch from what they bake
this cake recipe is delicious i did not use the frosting recipe because i made a ho ho cake and tried the cake because i have a chocolate cake mix i used 34 cup of sour cream because that is all i had on hand the cake was so moist and the best chocolate cake ever tasted i baked it in a lasagna pan instead thanks sandy for sharing your recipe
the frosting has a tangy taste to it kinda different but not badthe cake is moist but lacks chocolate flavor
i never make a cake that i thought came out well until this one great recipe easy and nice and moist a keeper
this cake is amazing and does make a large cake made it twice now and the reviews were outstanding very moist and dense be prepared and have some cake lovers ready to help eat it could halve the recipe and have enough for a smaller crowd i read one review that said it chocolatey enough or chocolate so not true you can control the depth of chocolate flavor by the quality of the cocoa powder you use deep rich chocolate flavor with scharffen berger cocoa powder this will forever be my chocolate cake recipe
this made a really high cake it was over 7 inches when done and it was nice and moist but lacked chocolate flavour i would probably not waste such expensive ingredients again i have a sour cream chocolate cake which is better and less expensive
i made this cake for my family and i want to say that i loved it it was delicious from the cake to the frosting one problem i did have was it was a little dry and not as moist like i like my cakes i don39t know if i left them in the oven too long or what i will try it again maybe with a little less flour the next time to see if that helps any advice would be appreciated
i tried this once after stumbling across it my family was amazed hard to find it again but so glad i didwrote it down this time
i made this yesterday for my birthday cake i used cake flour and subbed hot dark roast coffee in place of the boiling water and also sifted the dry ingredients to be sure all of the lumps were out but otherwise followed the recipe exactly after adding the hot coffee the batter was really thin i39ve never made a cake with such runny batter before and was a little nervous about it i baked 2 layers on the top rack and 1 on the bottom rack the top rack cakes were ready at the 30 minute mark so i pulled them outthe cake that had been on the bottom rack was still liquid in the middle so i moved it to the top rack and baked it another 7 or 8 minutes the top of that 3rd layer had a funny darkened pupilinaneyeball sort of center appearance probably from the jiggling it received when i moved it to the top rack but it was fully baked and unnoticeable once it was frosted i made my own frosting a butter amp cocoa powder version that i know is delicious since some folks mentioned they didn39t like the sour cream flavored icing much the cake had a nice dense moist texture and a great nottoochocolatey flavor it makes a huge cake mine was 434 tall when assembled so be sure to cut thin slices i will save this to bake again we shared a huge chunk with the neighbors and are still enjoying leftovers
this recipe is perfect as written i didn39t change a thing and got fantastic reviews from friends and family exactly what i was looking for
loved by the whole family for my father39s 70th birthday i needed to make it dairy free so i used dairyfree margarine and sour cream in the cake and frosting for the baking pans i always grease line with parchment paper grease and flour so the cakes come out effortlessly
cake was good not the frosting we didn39t care for it at all
have made this many times with beautiful success and currently have a halved recipe in the oven in 2 cake layersfor the not rising comment i wonder how old the baking soda was or if toni used cold liquids a quick tip to make sure that the cake has a good bake or to make any cake bake well is to have roomtemperature liquidssoft solids i allow the butter eggs and sour cream to get to room temperature before using them i always keep my vanilla extract at room temperature i also used cake flour and follow the tips on the cake flour box about how to compensate for allpurpose flour it does make a difference for cakes i promise while the batter does get more liquidy after adding the water i wonder if esteli had the oven preheated to the right temperatureif you don39t prefer the frosting there are thousands of frosting recipes out there pick one that is highly rated by many people and try it
this is a fantastic cake for carving novelty cakes i used a bread knife and there were so few crumbs i39m grateful for this recipe as i had tried another with poor results and i was practically out of regular sugar thankfully i had these ingredients on hand so my son ended up with a beautiful birthday cake that tasted delicious it was perfect just a note to other baker39s after cooling and resting this cake seemed to compress a tad more than most other cakes i used shaped pans bit had to do carving to get it right it was very worth it the rocket cake had a tapered base and wide middle but the cake still stood firmly on its own and the two baker39s who tried the cake asked for the recipe thank you
this cake was delicious it39s been a hit each time i39ve made it
won39t let you down fabulous a keeper
truly the perfect chocolate cake if you are looking for an elegant chocolate cake for a special occasion look no further it tastes like heavenly fudge looks beautiful in a cake dish and cuts into nice slices without crumbling better than anything you could buy in a bakery thank you sandra johnson
this cake is awesome i live at high altitude and had to make adjustments to account for that i decreased the sugar to 2 12 cups increased the flour to 3 cups increased the water by adding an additional 13 cup and decreased baking soda to 2 12 tsp i made cupcakes instead of cake i usually let my batter rest for at least 15 minutes before baking however i made my first batch as soon as the batter was loaded and the cupcakes rose okay but spread a little the batter that had a chance to rest made perfect cupcakes they rose without spreading at all it39s important at high altitude to not fill the pans too high i filled them to about a half to 34 inch from the top and it was perfect unfortunately there are no magic adjustments that you can use for every recipe it39s all trial and error at altitude but my adjustments luckily were perfect for this recipe
the cake itself was excellent and i will absolutely make again very thick three layers and super moist i was not thrilled with the frosting it has a sharp taste to it possibly from the sour cream it ended up tasting primarily like powdered sugarsour instead of being chocolatey like i was hoping nonetheless i received many compliments and as some other commenters have said it does keep well for several days
awesome cake outstanding several days later as well didn39t change a thing
i baked the chocolate cake tonight and it is beautiful the layers or high so it made a big cake the flavor is great the icing is wonderful and easy to make i will make this cake again for thanksgiving i will post a picture on fb
hello everyone i am not a pro in the kitchen but love to try recipes and eat delicious food i followed this recipe exactly as above the amount of water seems problematic to me i put the amount indicated and the bater became so watery but decided to give it a shot after 35 minutes of baking the cake was still super watery so i put it an other 10 minutes and still watery it ended up staying in the oven for more than an hour until a toothpick came out clean the cake came out actually kind of dry instead of moist can someone tell me what i did wrong

i followed the direction closely the cakes did not rise at all i have googled reasons why it would not rise and baking powder was mentioned many times i see all the great reviews but cannot find out why mine flopped so bad
this was the most delicious chocolate cake i didn39t change a thing the flavor and moistness that the sour cream gave it was unlike any other it kept for several days before even beginning to get slightly dry which is definitely worth a of a five star rating in my book will definitely make again
i luv this cake
sandy u never fail to amaze me i luv this cake
just made this cake over the weekend for my husband and for the cocoa powder i used hershey39s special dark the cake was so moist and my family loved it it39s definitely been added to my recipe collection
tasty and yum want eat
my family declared this the best chocolate cake ever i used my own homemade frosting sift 14 cup cocoa powder 1 cup powdered sugar 1 dash salt and cream with 14 cup crisco or butter add 1 whipped egg white a great recipe would not change a thing about the cake
haven39t baked it yet but wondering if using cream cheese instead of sour cream would 34improve34 the taste of the icing as i read the one baker mentioned she did not receive a good report of the frosting i have both ingredients always may try first the sour cream way not waiting for a birthday to bake it either sounds luscious
i took this to a special choc cake contest at the polk county fair saturday and it took first place its excellent i would highly recommend i baked it exactly as the recipe was written
this is one dynamite cake if you haven39t tried it please do you can39t go wrong i never use coffeejust follow the recipe
i see that people are substituting coffee for the water when do you add coffeewater i don39t see it in the instructions
made this cake for my husband and he ate almost all the cake fudgy and delicious i too used coffee instead of water wonderful texture and crumb will definitely make this again
this cake turned out great really moist and fudgy i did take others suggestions and use coffee instead of the water i can39t rate the frosting though some people said it tasted strange and i couldn39t risk my picky eaters39 bday cake tasting weird
perfect chocolate cake recipe i used half of all ingredients and used a bundt pan it looked beautiful garnished with ganache and strawbwrries
ronnir1 i use a 9x13 pan all the time to bake my cakes and i always use 350 hope this helps
what temp and time would you use for 9x11 cake or is it 9x13 sounds great
coffee seems to enhance the taste of chocolate so i tried this cake with some espresso and omfg it makes this cake as if it was made from one of those best high dollar bakeries you always want to try but could never afford lol i did tweak it a little hear and there in a few other places as well to make it mine used irish butter because after all i am irish an irish woman married to a mexican believe me i am paying for it in spades my daughter is giving me fits by way of showing me her temper at times who would have thought a half mexican half irish kid would have had much of a temper coughcough but she absolutely loves this cake too
this recipe is like the hershey chocolate cake recipe except for sour cream i39ve made the hershey numerous times and it39s wonderful so i39m sure this one is too
now this is what chocolate cake is all about rich amp oh soooo decadent one of the best recipes ever and not too difficult thanks for sharing sandy
i have tried a lot of chocolate cake recipes and this one is by far the best it also makes quite a bit of cake this is the only recipe i use for chocolate cake
taste great my family lived ut
i just wonder why so much sugar it is a little too much from my point of view
cake is dense with deep rich flavor icing is complex together it39s a little too rich next time i39m going to make it with butter cream frosting this cake shows pretty and serves 1620 easilt
i made a version of this cake for mothers day it is truly one of the best cakes we have ever had all while being easy to make thank you for this recipe
unbelievable super moist and full of flavour love it
this cake is amazing it doesn39t last long around this house
easy to make tasty i halved the recipe and made 18 cupcakes baked for about 22 minutes they were a little too full next time i will make a few more so they don39t overflow
excellent cake i use cake flour and substitute hot black coffee for the hot water i have tried other substitutions but they do not improve the cake this is a very rich cake because of the sour cream so a small piece of cake is very filling to keep the cake tender go easy on the mixing and get the cake in the oven as soon as the mixing is complete
made this cake this weekend wonderful it is not a fluffy cake but a moist fudge texture i was hoping for a much richer chocolate flavor the frosting goes on smooth and make the frosting cake look nice i will definitly make this again but next time i will add expresso powder to the cake
5 stars doesn39t cover it this was the most amazing cake this was the first time i made a cake from scratch my daughter requested it for christmas so moist and fudgy you will not be disappointed
just made the cake for a birthday in a darth vader shaped cake pan and it came out beautifully and made a dozen cupcakes with the leftover batter it39s very moist and was such a hit this recipe is definitely a keeper
looks very similar to the one on the hershey cocoa powder can my mom make it all the time i am looking forward to see how this recipe compares
best cake i have ever made
this is absolutely the best chocolate cake i have ever had it is totally worth the effort thank you so much for sharing
everyone in my family agreed this was the best cake they39d ever had i made just a few adjustments i added in a tsp each of espresso powder and cinnamon and i just made a simple ganache frosting because i was out of powdered sugar will make again and again
any idea on how many cups of batter this makes
this is an amazingly moist cake and the icing is the easiest icing i39ve ever worked with i did sub the sour cream for cream cheese but it turned out phenomenal definitely the ultimate chocolate cake
i agree with others this is the perfect chocolate cake and my new goto recipe for birthday and other special occasions i39ve never had good luck with layer cakes but this one worked perfectly first time i forgot to add water love the idea of using coffee instead of water but it still turned out fine second time the batter at the bottom of the bowl did not get mixed well and it still turned out okay each time i spread raspberry preserves between layers and on top prior to frosting love the silky smooth frosting then i made genache and poured it over the topso rich and yummy can39t wait to make another one
i baked mine in a bundt pan omitting the icing it is the best chocolate cake recipe i39ve ever tried
wow what can i say pulled out my cake from the oven about 3 hours ago and there is nothing left delicious i did do a slight change instead of plain boiling water i used fresh brewed coffee got to go making another one thanks
hi just wondering if i can use buttermilk instead of sour cream in this receipe very keen to try this chocolate cake version
came out perfectly a very delicious chocolate cake however not too happy with frosting and may put some cream cheese or something to it the next time
perfect light and fluffy
i made this cake in a 9x13 pan it took about an hour to bake this is such a good cake i am not a big fan of frosting so i didn39t frost it and it sure didn39t need it good job
best simple chocolate cake evereasy and yummy5 stars easily
the cake is great one of the best chocolate cakes i39ve ever had however i am surprised how many good reviews there are on the frosting i didn39t like the taste of it others i served it to liked it but i could taste the sour cream i think a homemade buttercream would be delicious on this cake
this cake and frosting are absolutely delicious it tastes even more delicious the second day i made cupcakes for a large birthday party it makes 48 cupcakes a
one of the best ever among choc cakes but sandy or anyone please tell me what39s the ingredients in this recipe that makes it stand out from an average choc cake
this is undoubtedly the absolute best chocolate cake and frosting i39ve ever tasted i ended up having to add an additional cup or so of powdered sugar i sifted the sugar before measuring and probably shouldn39t have it didn39t say to i was afraid it might be lumpy if i didn39t sifting probably made it not fill the measuring cup as full when measuring sandy i can see why you won the contestwhen reading the recipe it had a few things completely different from all the methods i39ve ever used and made me want to try it to see how it turned out it is absolutely wonderful
the first time i baked this i forgot to add the boiling water i thought it would be really dry but it was still surprisingly delicious currently have this recipe in the oven with the boiling water added this consistency after adding the boiling water worried me it seemed a little too liquidy than other cake recipes i have made is this normal
i made this and it turned out delicious it was easy to follow and i will be making this again my family love it
best cake ever been making this one since 1985 it39s a mable hoffman recipe first showed up in the ladie39s home journal that year i also often will freeze the third layer and tote the other two to whatever event needs a great chocolate cake
this was a yummy moist cake the frosting threw me a bit i think i will use cream cheese in it next time overall good easy to follow recipe the turns outs beautifully
what is sour creamcan we adjust it with yoghurt
peggycamp16 baking cocoa is cocoa powder it is unsweetened and in the baking section of the storeas with a few other reviews i always substitute coffee for the waterit enhances the chocolate you will not taste the coffee
is the baking cocoa for the cake semisweet or unsweetenedthank you pj
i made this cake for a potluck luncheon i put a layer of vanilla cream pudding between the layers it was a big hit at the potluck this cake is very rich and dense
beautiful moist cake it39s my new goto chocolate cake recipe when i don39t want to make a flourless cake and i don39t want to make one with a browniedecadence density one thing i do is add espresso powder though it39s almost a kneejerk reaction for me to find some way to add more flavor to a baked item that requires water than simply adding water substituting the water with hot coffee or just adding a teaspoon or so of espresso powder to the boiling water is a great way to accent the chocolate flavor wonderful recipe
one of the best chocolate cake recipes i39ve ever followed
best chocolate cake ever moist delicious and looked beautiful will definitely be my go to cake
so long chocolate store box cake this cake was very moist i will definitely be making it again the the future the frosting was a little sweet for us so i will just cut back on the confectioners sugar next time but a great recipe
i made this for my husband39s birthday party since he requested chocolate cake and everyone raved about it there were 10 people at the party and we still had lots leftover even though some guests had seconds and thirds it tastes so much better after being refrigerated overnight i highly recomend this recipenote i used only semisweet chocolate since i didn39t have unsweetened and it still tasted wonderful not too sweet
followed recipe as written the cake was moist and delicious would definitely make again only change i would make is to line bottom of pan with parchment or waxed paper to make it easier to remove from pan
divine this has become my go to chocolate cake recipe
hands down the best chocolate cake we have ever made my daughter and i made this as the centerpiece of our family holiday meal and it did not disappoint the frosting is on the sweet side but it balances the cake we made the cake with coffee instead of water and it was wonderful first dessert to go on a well stocked dessert table this recipe is a keeper
one of the best everyone loved it
so decadent i made this for my 34sweetheart34 on his birthday we had 17 guests everyone raved about how velvety smooth is was my house smelled like chocolate for hours on end i found it to be rich but not heavy amazing chocolate flavor
my cake turned out heavy and didn39t rise i loved the frosting but i obviously did something wrong as it was not fluffy but more solid like the texture of clay
this will be the only chocolate cake recipe i make from here on out so delicious and beautifulthank you
my family loved this chocolate cake it is a very large cake so today i made it again and cut everything in half and put it in a 9 x 13 cake pan it turned out just a great as the first time i make it it is our family39s new favorite cake thanks sandy
very moist and delicious perfect chocolate cake recipe
i made this cake the other day and passed out pieces to my friends now everybody wants the recipe excellent cake just the way it is no changes needed
i shared with family and friends they said it was the best chocolate cake they had ever put in their mouths will definitely make it again
made this cake for my husbands birthdayfollowed directions exactly as written and it turned out perfectly i did not use the frosting my husband requested a different kind coconut but i look forward to trying the frosting out in the future
this cake is wonderful i followed the recipe exactly except i only made 2 round cakes instead of 3 and it was perfect
excellent good for a crowd
i39m rating 5 stars because it39s really delish but i would not take mine anywhere because of how it looked the layers rose in the oven but sunk in the middle as they cooled and no nothing happened to make them fall what could i have done wrongi think i packed the brown sugar too firmly because it took forever to cream with the amount of butter and to me never got the fluffy texture so would overbeating have done itthanks for your inputthanks
this is the best chocolate cake i have ever baked it has become my friends and family39s favorite i melt a bar of bittersweet chocolate and spread it each layer and then top it with the frosting i gives it a slight crunch with a burst of chocolate yummy
amazing cake i made this cake for the first time and it is wonderful my husband and many of the individuals that we shared with stated that it was the best chocolate cake that they ever had i totally agree and will make it many times again it is one of our favorites also i agree with other reviewers each layer of cake is a nice size and there is plenty of icing to coat the whole cake nicely
loved the consistency of the cake and the frosting was very easy to workthe cake is not as sweet as a typical cake due to the brown sugar but rather has a very rich complex flavor and is wonderfully dense if you have to bring a showstopper dessert to impress your friends fire up the oven
easy enough to make and very professional and glamorous looking a real showpiece i thought cake was a little 34dry34 frosting was good but i39ve made better with less expensive ingredients
i am a eleven year old girl i used your resipy to make cupkakes and i got first place thank you so much
makes a very tall cake with perfect amount of frosting for between and over the cake will make again
this cake was amaazzzingmade it for a graduation party as cupcakes with a brown butter cream frosting and people could not stop raving about how good it was it39s definitely a must try
frosting was good
i see that the cake is amazing but it say servers 16 i would like to make it for 10 may be still smaller how do i get the correct measure of ingredients please anyone let me know
this dreamy extremely rich chocolate dake is the bomb tasted like it was made by a professional cake baker provided 12 goodsized tasty slices very rich extremely smooth frosting the brown sugar cake baked precisely and was a good foil for the extremely rich icing i made this cake exactly as instructed is the best chocolate cake i have ever tasted
this cake wasn39t great it was awesome totally delicious we kinda ran out of baking cocoa so we had to add chocolate chips and we changed the brown sugar to 1 cup and 12 of cup of white sugar still went out great my parents said it was really moist thank you for creating this recipe
this is a fabulous cake it39s almost as good as my goto chocolate cake recipe
my five stars is for the frosting wow i39ve never tasted better i have the feeling that the cake is just as good but because i live at high altitude and have no idea how to alter cake recipes to rise properly i did not make the cake
very moist exactly what i was looking for
love the chocolate lay flavor without being too sweet

i chose this recipe as my maiden voyage into the 34from scratch34 baking world i received a mixer for christmas and have been nervous about trying it out i have never been much of a baker but at the age of 55 i decided to go for it i made a big mess in the kitchen amp ended up with dry cake mixture all over the place amp myself and despite trying to be careful i made the same big mess while mixing the frosting nonetheless the cake turned out beautifully in spite of my inexperience i had a ball but must admit it was a lot of work hubby said it was worth itbut he didn39t do anything but eat it lol good recipeparticularly love the frosting
this really is the best chocolate cake i39m throwing away all of my other chocolate cake recipes
the best chocolate cake i have ever had it was absolutely amazing i made this for my moms birthday cake and everyone loved it i wouldn39t change anything about it thank you for such an amazing recipe
decadent no need to say more
i39m a sucker for chocolate cake but was surprised to see the hot water is added at the end of mixing the batter i use hershey39s special dark cocoa and i always 39predisolve39 the cocoa with hot strong coffee then i add it to the batter making for a super dark cake the only change i made in this recipe was taking 13 cup water and replacing with hot coffee to dissolve my cocoa powder delicious cake
this is one the best if not the best chocolate cake i39ve ever tasted or made i always use a little extra chocolate in all my recipes plus i used pure mexican vanilla in this recipe thanks for sharing sandy
i made this for christmas and it was so so good too much for my husband and i but we finished it 4 days later and pounds heavier truly a wonderful cake thank you for the recipe oh and the frosting was the best ever
wow rich and moist and chocolate pow i think this is the best scratch cake recipe i have tried yet i am not a baker so i steer clear of those recipes calling for cake flour and super careful measuring the hot water part scared me a little but i followed the directions exactly and it was perfect the amount of frosting is very generous and my husband thought it was perfect even though it was a little too sweet for my taste i will be making this again and again thanks for sharing this i can see why it won a prize
this is truly the most delicious chocolate cake i have ever tasted it39s rich and creamy i will be making it for christmas eve i have no doubt it will be a hit thanks you for sharing
amazing cakei just made this cake 2 days ago my husband39s coworkers loved this cakei used 3 cups of cake flouri didn39t have enough sour cream to prepare the frosting so i used half cup of sour cream and half cup of philadelphia cream cheese and it was deliciosothank you for such a good recipe
best chocolate cake recipe in a long time easy to make and a big wow effect at the table i put some sour cherry jam between the layers goes great with the sweet chocolate thanks for sharing this recipe sandra i will make another one for christmas eve
this is absolutely fabulous it is very moist with a creamy chocolate frosting that is quite addicting i used cake flour and it turned out great this is a show stopper and special enough for a holiday dessert yum
perfect recipe
i consider myself a serious cake baker and pride myself in knowing a great cake from just a good one great chocolate cake recipes are very hard to find this is a great chocolate cake recipe i made it with cake flour because i didn39t have any ap flour it turned out super it was moist but not heavy just light the flavors were well rounded but not too sweet and the texture was super i believe the brown sugar and the sour cream really set it apart from any other chocolate cake i ever made this one was perfect i didn39t perfect the frosting but the cake is definitely a keeper
this was on the cover and pg58 of the latest issue and i decided to try it for a formal dinner dance i was attending i was pleased that i had all the ingredients and that the directions were very simple it was easy to make and then when i put it together the next day it came together beautifullybest frosting so yummy it was so fancy when sliced and displayed and all my close friends were demanding slices as soon as they saw it my dessert was the first to go and everyone declared it to be one of the best chocolate cakes they had ever had the balance of the sour cream with the sugar kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet and it was more old school in recipe without the white sugar and with the boiling water and sour cream i used semisweet chocolate chips instead of the semisweet bakers chocolate the frosting is plentiful and delicious and for a garnish i crushed up some chocolate chips and dusted the top it was a massive hit everyone declared it to be so moist and to taste like it came from a bakery definitely an awesome cake will be making it again for thanksgiving
this was really good very easy to make will need to make it again
this is my go to chocolate cake i39ve made it many many times for birthdays i just make a buttercream frosting so i can make it fun colors the only thing i ever alter is the type of frosting love love love
excellent i reduced the recipe in size so i only made one layer with no frosting so i could test it i live at a high altitude 4600 ft i wouldn39t make this cake without adjusting for altitude as it is so tender that it would cave in if it weren39t adjusted i removed a 14 of the butter and 14 of the sugar it turned out great other than that it is very tasty it will be my 34go to34 chocolate cake recipeoh i39m not a fan of sour cream i used the sour cream in the cake with very good resultsbut i didn39t use the frosting recipe though as i didn39t think i39d like it instead i used a cocoa buttercream frosting from an old betty crocker cookbook i put whipped cream in the frosting instead of the milk and then whipped it very fluffy
pi made cupcakes first the cake boss all without frosting and then sandy39s i had my daughters and husband taste both sandy39s won i didn39t even have to put frosting on them i like to make cakes for people on the side now sandy39s recipe will be my chocolate cake recipe in my cake bookp

outstanding i made this cake for my husband39s birthday and it was a huge hit we love very nice restaurants and this reminded us of a dessert there just add a dallop of real whipped cream and you have an elegant dessert cut the pieces thin because it is rich this is a new family favorite deena
this is the best chocolate cake i39ve ever tasted making another one to send to my son39s house for easter dinner thank you sandy
very good cake
fabulous friends said it was restaurant quality the only thing i did was double the chicken broth to make more sauceand sprinkled a little flour to thicken slightly
so happy the sauce is homemade instead of using canned soup which is full of things i don39t want to put in my body
this was great might add a pinch of cayenne to the flour next time
my husband usually hates chicken breast because it is white meat and would prefer dark but he always raves about this dish the chicken is so tender it is amazing
hubby and i found this recipe was a 5 star i did add a few things which is very much what i always seem to do first i didn39t have the chicken breast so i used the chicken thighs i didn39t skin or debone them i used them as they were just made sure i cooked them long enough second i also added some seasonings to the flour onion powder garlic powder amp italian seasoning along with sampp third to the broth i added the juice of one lemon right now i seem to have a lot of lemons and i like using them whenever i can they seem to brighten the flavor because there is only the two of us this recipe has given me two nights worth of dinners 34cook once eat twice34
this is such a great recipe for chicken i used 1 cup of broth because 12 cup just did not seem enough i added diced potatoes to the mushroom mix i cooked it the same amount of time and the potatoes were done that extra 12 cup of broth made gravy for the potatoes i will be making this again
this was absolutely delicious i am sick of grilled chicken at this point in the summer and wanted something different i had mushrooms i needed to use when i stumbled upon this recipe since it makes 4 servings my husband and i have leftovers for another night i wait
my new go to chicken recipe i double the mushrooms amp butter and add a 12 c white wine to the broth we like lots of gravy to serve with the mashed potatoes i serve with this along with either green beans my husbands favorite or corn great meal that is quick amp easy
this has become one of our favorite go to recipes it39s flavorful healthy and easy to prepare if i am serving it with riced cauliflower a very healthy swap for rice i double the mushrooms and broth and add a little flour to thicken slightly so that we can spoon that goodness over the riced cauliflower
this was so simple but soooo good i did add a little garlic salt but other than that i followed the recipe big hit
very delicious loved it would not change anything
we love this recipe i will put it in my meal rotation i loved the fact that i could clean up each step while the next step was cooking as well as preparing a tossed salad i had a clean kitchen when it came out of the oven i served it with the salad and roasted yukon gold potatoes delicious
my husband took one bite and said 34this is good34 he expected the typical dry chicken breast it is so moist and tasty we loved it yes we added about 3 times more mushrooms and some more green onions want to try next time with spinach
great combination of ingredients that together make a wonderful meal
very good and moist i will make this recipe again
i give this recipe an a yummy yummy yummy
delish such an easy recipe yet so good my husband loved the mushroomsand i did put extra in the dish
family loved it i am diabetic so i altered the recipe by using almond flour instead of regular flour deglazed the pan with white wine then sautéed shallots garlic and fresh spinach along with the mushrooms calculated one serving 196 calories 8 carbs is respectable without the math
this is a fan favorite in our house my kids ask for it all the time it39s a very simple recipe with a lot of flavor the only things i do different is use a lot more mushrooms and a little bit more of the mozzarella cheese because my family loves both i love to serve this alongside some fresh steamed or roasted asparagus and smashed redskin potatoes
my go to now always elegant to serve easy and tasty
very nice i loved that it was quick to make following ideas from other reviewers i sliced my large chicken breasts 2 in half that worked well i also added 14 c white wine to the sauce and the little remaining flour left after dredging the breasts to thicken it a little i was heavy on the mushrooms cause we love them i added some snipped fresh rosemary and chives to the sauce because we love fresh herbs i served over zucchini noodles and asparagus that were sautéed in olive oil garlic and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese it was delightful the only change i will make next time is to double the sauce we would have enjoyed more over our 34zoodles34 would serve this to company
ok i just made this i didn39t have any green onions so had to leave them off still very very good thanks to gail for the idea to cut the chicken breasts in half worked perfectly there39s nothing about this recipe i would change thanks for sharing i should say i rarely create accounts on websites but i did here just to rate the recipe
this has got to be one of my favorite baked chicken dishes it is easy and doesn39t seem like it would be that flavorful but it is so glad i tried it whole family gave it a thumbs up make sure you use every drop of mushroom sauce on the chicken breasts and we used a good amount of green onions because we like them
very tasty instead of pounding the chicken breasts which were large i sliced them in half which worked well i also used a heavy hand with the mushrooms because i like them
delicious
restaurant quality
made this last night so easy so good
uh so this is phenomenal the only change i made was adding some white wine to the skillet with the mushrooms so so good
my whole family loved this recipe the chicken was so tender a very easy recipe to make it is definitely a keeper
my husband39s comment with the first bite 34this is delicious34 my favorite taste tester food judge really liked this dish and so did i i followed the recipe ingredients exactly other than upgrading by using portobello mushrooms procedurewise i sliced two 8oz chicken breasts lengthwise rather than pound them to 1434 thickness doing that saved a little effort and it did not at all impact the taste this recipe can make a novice cook look like a seasoned pro it was flavorful juicy and the two of us could have easily eaten the other two servings i will definitely be making this again i liked the idea shared in the reviews of sauteing the onions i39m also toying with the idea of using half chicken broth and half white wine for the sauce mixture to answer 34lousey cook in texas39 question i don39t know that it would taste as good as making it fresh the breading on the chicken might get a bit soggy you could try it but it really doesn39t take long to put this all together
can this be prepared the night before so all i have to do is bake it
alice look at step 3
this was good it is chicken season to your own taste duh why are not intelligent people even trying to cook the recipe ingredients tell you how much chicken and step 3 tells you when to put on the cheese do you people need help crossing the street
made with sherry instead of broth and left out the mozzarella because i didn39t have any family loved it will try doubling the mushrooms and sauce next time delicious
delicious made tonite for dinner and my husband and i really enjoyed the chicken i added some koser salt ground pepper and garlic powder to the flour before dredging the chicken will definitely make again for the whole family for our sunday get togethers
awesome this recipe is definitely a must for keeping i did add more mushrooms and i salted peppered and added garlic to the chicken breast before flouring this would also be great for dinner guests thanks so mush for sharing
it says in the top line of the ingredients that you need and i quote 344 boneless skinless chicken breast halves 1 pound34 for this recipe
for barry the answer to your question4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves 1 pound read the next time thank you
recipe ingredient list does not include amount of chicken how many breasts
when do you put in the green onions and the cheese you have listed in your ingredients they are not in your directions
awesome i have made this a couple of times i use way more mushrooms and chicken broth so i have lots to add to each chicken i also add garlic and use shredded parmesan this is soooo good
i liked this recipe used boneless chicken thighs and yellow onions i sauteed the onions before i browned the chicken i will be making this again thanks for sharing
i thought it was absolutely delicious i did make one change so i have to pound the chicken i used boneless skinless thighs everything else i followed to the letter will definitely make again
i haven39t made this dish yet but just needed to speak my peace when i read reviews i look for whether it was good bad or just so so when people start saying they made it but they added this or deleted that then i kind of just skip over that recipe maybe if you have to make a lot of changes you could just enter a new recipe
made this the other night and it was delicious i had a bit of chardonnay that i added in my husband liked it and the chicken was very moist you really need any added salt because of the cheeses great recipe
this chicken is a hit with my family and for anyone i prepare it for it is so very good
i made this last night for our girls39 game night dinner and everyone loved it doubled the mushrooms and butter they were sauted in and used 12 cup chicken broth and 12 cup sherry for more sauce on the chicken served it with steamed broccoli and rice excellent i will definitely make this again
i added a small halved and sliced vidalia onion to the mushroom saute i used the entire container of sliced baby bella mushrooms maybe 2 cups rather than dirty an 11 x 17 pan i added the chicken breast back to my heavy saute pan spooned the lovely mushroom and onion sauce over and baked moist and perfectly done at 15 minutes oops i forgot to add the grated cheese but didnt miss it
excellent fast and easy used extra mushrooms and instead of pounding chicken just sliced into two thin breasts very flavorful and moist keeper
sounds delicious
i39ve made this several times delicious and like the idea of dry sherry instead of brothwill definitely try that next time
omit the salt and use low or no sodium broth plenty of salt in the cheese your ankles will thank you
original recipe was with sherry not broth amazing everyone loved made lots did add extra mushrooms
last night was the first time making this dinner39 it was fast due to the light browning on both sides of the chicken which comes out juicy after it39s baked it39s easy since i prepared this before hand letting it sit in the broth until my family all arrived then 20 mins later at 350 degrees i removed it to add the 2 toppings along with spinach for iron then cooked it 5 more minutes and it was absolutely delicious even the kids loved thisthank you barbara for sharing ur great tasting recipe
makes a beautiful presentation over noodles
quick easy and delicious just as recipe is written fresh mushrooms and scallions are a must
i have been making this recipe for many years making no changes just adding more mushrooms always excellent
we really loved this recipe easy and delicious
super delicious the whole family loves this i tripled the recipe and still no leftovers definitely a keeper
everyone really liked this one it is a keeper
loved it i included the green onions when reducing the broth
i39ve made this many times it39s the besteasy and delicious
delicious just follow the recipe
great recipe have made this a few times added garlic per reviews and a whole package of mushrooms as they make a great side dish
could not make it as your kraft add covered the directions
loved it i will definitely try some of the suggestions in the below comments for doubling the sauce and adding a little garlic or lemon juice
this one39s a keeper i doubled everything well ok i probably tripled the cheese didn39t flatten the chicken just baked it an extra 6 minutes lots of flavour tender and juicy
easy peasy and delicious used boneless skinless thighs
great flavour you need to double or triple the sauce i39ve made it twice once with chicken breasts and then with boneless skinless chicken thighs i added granulated garlic to the flour and doubled the amount of mushrooms everyone loved it
really enjoyed this dish i didn39t pound the breasts just cooked them as is but the sauce definitely needs to be increased there was not enough next time i39ll at least double it but the flavor of this dish was so good yum
very good i added two tablespoons of lemon juice to the sauce
made this for dinner very good took to work the next day for lunch still just as good as the first night
this is very easy to make and very tasty i added a bit of garlic powder and fresh chives instead of green onions because i did not have the onions on hand this would be nice for a dinner party think i will try it on some friends
this was super easy and really delicious i didn39t have fresh mushrooms so i used two small cans i wasn39t sure about that because we love fresh mushrooms but when they were sauteed in butter and added to the recipe they were great my husband asked me to add more cheese and more green onion the next time when we heated it for leftovers i would add a handful of shredded cheese on the chicken i39ll also try chicken tenderloins as i almost always have them on hand just have to watch the cooking time fabulous good enough for a company dinner
easy recipe to follow and memorize thank you for the awesome recipe this is now one of my favorites
followed recipe exactly amp is delicious
i looked at the recipe and thought it would be good it looked so easy it was very easy and very good i would serve this at a wedding or wedding like event it was great as leftovers as well i added onion parsley garlic powder salt and pepper to the chicken in the frying pan i didn39t fry it as long and let it bake in the oven longer
this was very tasty loved how easy it was too i doubled the ingredients for the sauce served chicken and sauce over rice i will definitely make this recipe again and again
so yummy my husband loved it and he is not even a fan of mushrooms will definitely make again
excellent can39t wait to make again
i39ve made this a few times now and it39s fabulous everyone that39s eaten it has wanted the recipe it39s a keeper i39ve noted that the size the breasts are flattened to is not as important as simply keeping them uniform so that they cook evenly
wonderful dish a local restaurant has a similar dish but this is much better i tend to always pound the chicken breasts as they cook evenly and are so tender
great dish very easy and full of flavor used thin breast and did not flatten them
pwow this is really good it smells amazing while it is baking and my kids just loved it even better as leftovers i put it in my daughter39s thermos and sent it to lunch with her the next day 100 gone this is certainly a keeper no changes to recipe necessaryp
i didn39t pound the chicken but let the breasts cook until their temperature was about 160 degrees very good recipe
i must admit that i was very skeptical about the ingredients it sounded a little bland but i was wrong this was very tasty i would only make enough to eat right away because the leftovers didn39t taste as good
love this recipe serve it with with rice and you39ve got a great weekend meal and leftovers to look forward to the next night definitely in my rotation now
very good
my family loved it and it was so juicy and flavorful
wonderful
just made this tonight and my husband and i both thought it was so good i added some garlic powder and ground pepper to the chicken while sauteing for some extra flavor and left off the green onions very tender and flavorful great for a week night meal but would also be nice for guests definitely a keeper
delicious and very easy to make i served it with instant brown rice takes only 10 minutes to make and fresh mini bell peppers i liked it so much that i had it for dinner last night and then for lunch and dinner today
this is unbelievable i used sliced baby portabella mushrooms i added some leftover white wine it was really elegant
great go to recipe quick and east and very easy with a good blending of mushroom sauce and cheeses i simply use thin chicken breasts and that makes it even quicker
i would like to serve this with fresh pasta would i need sauce for the pasta or just olive oil and pepper any suggestions
5 star recipe want to make it 6 stars sprinkle with crisp fried crumbled bacon before serving
this was so easy and so tender this is part of our normal rotation now by the way this is also great without the cheese for your picky eaters just add it after
this was delicious made it with chicken tenders but otherwise didn39t change a thing really easy dish that is sure to be a crowd pleaser
i love this recipe it39s great for a quick weeknight meal but even better for company it tastes and looks like it39s a lot of work but so simple it39s a goto dish when i have guests overtip this is also very easy to serve to someone who can39t have dairy it39s still delicious if you keep the cheeses separate and sprinkle it on after dishing it up
i tried this recipe tonight and it was deliciousthank youi wish i knew how to add a picture
easy quick and tasty chicken dish very tende rand love the cheeses in this recipe i plan to make this again soon
excellent dish wonderful flavor i couldn39t believe that i made it just the right amount of everything thanks for a wonderful recipe
outstanding one of the best chicken dishes i39ve ever found too slight modifications i made include the use of chicken tenders and onion powder and garlic powder added to the mushrooms i didn39t have any green onions to echo previous comment this is a new favorite
this is excellent i did add garlic as we love it and it was great a new favorite
i was looking for a recipe to use ingredients that i had left over so i used onion powder instead of green onions and a sprinkling of extrasharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella my family was totally over the moon for this dish superb
ths is one of the best chicken recipes i39ve ever found
wow is all i can say this is so yummy i think the only thing i would do differently is eliminate the salt and add a little garlic it was perfect with an entire 8oz container of mushrooms with some rice pilaf on the side anything more would have been too much food definitely making this again soon
very good i think next time i wont add the extra salt i think with the chicken broth it added enough salt it was very tasty and moist will definitely make again
these are very similar to paula deen39s chicken georgia recipe
this has been a family favorite in our house for years i admit i always use more cheese than it calls for probably 1 c and i use the whole 8 oz package of mushrooms
so good if you love mushrooms you have to try this recipe
this was easy and tasty i would add garlic to the mushroom saute next time and double the recipe i bet it39d be great as leftovers
this recipe was excellent it was easy to make too my husband even gave it 5 stars and he doesn39t give many recipes that high a rating it would make a great dish for company served it with brown rice lemon butter green beans and strawberry spinach salad
t his was so yummy and easy we will definetely make again
great tasting easy to make
this may be the best chicken recipe that i have ever made it is outstanding and can39t wait to have the leftovers
my kids said the word 34amazing34 countless times tonight it was a big hit in addition to being family friendly it39s party worthy a definite keeper
this chicken turned out very flavorful and moist i left out the mushrooms and added onions and italian herbs as i did not have any mushrooms it is a great gourmetstyle recipe that is not too complicated i would definitely make this again
i don39t use the cheese we love this dish
me and my husband really liked it i didn39t have any green onions but it turned out really well i used about a cup of broth to start out with and it boiled down good i loved the cheese on top and probably put more than called for the mushrooms were fantastic
one of my favorite 34company34 dishes especially when it isn39t grilling season so moist and flavorful i always receive rave reviews delicious with the 34herbed angel hair pasta34
i have made this recipe numerous times since the first time i served it to my family it is excellent we add additional mushrooms since we love them
this is just the best chicken recipe we love it
this is the most amazing tender chicken ever my whole family loves this and when my son comes home from college he always asks me to make this along with the mushrooms i will often add green peppers and onions turns out everytime
this was so easy to make and so delicious i added the whole package of mushrooms instead of just one cup and i did 14 cup chicken broth and 14 cup white wine i highly recommend this
great recipe
this was delicious i was feeling creative so i made some modifications i added a few splashes of white wine for flavour sautéed some garlic and onion in with the mushrooms i also added some season salt to the flour mix served with asparagus and dill cream sauceyummymy boyfriend gave it a 910 and said that i need to 34remember this one34
really enjoyed this recipe it was delicious and simple the only thing i did differently was saute the green onions with the mushrooms i served it with garlic egg noodles and broccoli even my 8 yr old and 5 yr old liked it they cleaned their plates
always looking for good relatively easy to prepare and able bake ahead if needed chicken recipes this one is a keeper we doubled the cheese scallions and sauce quantities
tender and flavorful describes this dish the family goes wild over it it39s simple and great tasting
i made this and it was very good but i39mm confused that you start out with 12 cup broth and it says to reduce it to 12 cup it ended up reducing to almost nothing because i didn39t realize it would go so fast so i added another 12 cup broth to pour over the chicken
wow everyone loved it i didn39t have mozzarella cheese or green onions and it was still wonderful next time i39ll try to have both we ate 2 hours ago and i can still taste it definately will make this one again
this chicken was absolutely delicious i39m on the lookout for low carbohydrate recipes as my boyfriend is watching his carbs and this filled the bill nicely i could make it even more lowcarb by just browning the breasts without the flour the list of ingredients was simple and i wasn39t expecting it to taste as wonderful as it did great recipe everyone loved it
awesome flavor i did not pound out the chicken breasts i cut them thinner as in tenders and i added extra green onions yum looks as awesome as it tastes
a meal rarely gets rated as excellent by everyone very good yes but not very often an excellent this one recipe received an excellent rating from all 4 family members
my kids loved it especially my oldest daughter
i can39t get over how delicious this dish was it is by far one of my favorites thanks for sharing
this was sooo good everything was so moist and delicious i made it for the first time 2 nights agoand my fiance requested that i make it again the very next night this is deff one of the best recipe39s i have ever cooked
i loved it and my guest did also i cut it in half for two people i pounded then instead of putting flour on it i sprinkled it with mccormicks perfect pinch garlic amp herb salt free then put it in an 8 x 8 pan with the mushrooms and onions on it and baked it covered then uncovered it and put the cheese on it
this was phenomenal and so easy i used chicken cutlets instead of pounding out chicken breasts had about 7 cutlets and i added some diced green bell pepper and minced garlic to the broth and mushrooms it was totally amazing i agree no need for the extra salt the parmesan gives plenty of flavor will be adding this to my faves
great my husband loved it and we will be making it again
i loved it
this is the best chicken ever sometimes i add green peppers too
delicious but definitely does not need any added salt
as far as i39m concerned this is the perfect recipe for a working mom very quick and easy and it39s delicious very easy to make on those busy weekdays but also good for a nice relaxing dinner
this is delicious and very easy to make the ingredients are healthy and my wife loved it
everyone i serve this too loves it it is wonderful and easy
my favorite i made it for my dad he said 34that is the best chicken i39ve ever had34 score
this was very good and simple to make i will make it again for my family whole family liked it
hubby and i loved this recipe the flavors were really outstanding to make it a little healthier i substituted wheat flour for the allpurpose and used partskim mozzarella
psuch a delicious recipep
pchicken is tender and very good one of my favorites my mom makes this often and i asked her for the recipe now i can make it alsop
i bet a few tsp of almond extract would be really nice too
can you use whole milk
my grandmother made this and when it came out of the oven she would spread some butter on it then sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on it
tried this recipe today and loved anyone know if it also works for cupcakes if so approximately how many does it make
my husband loves this recipe the only thing i find is i have to bake much longer than the 35 minutes sometimes an extra 20 minutes
my mom gave this recipe to me years ago and it was perfect for strawberry shortcake it transported well and held up well with the addition of the strawberry sauce easy to make and everyone enjoyed it
wonderfully flavored cake i followed the advice of one reviewer by adding the vanilla after i added the hot milk and butter i baked it for 35 minutes and dusted the top with powdered sugar
i followed the recipe as it but the cake came out dense i was expecting a lighter fluffier cake the flavor of the cake was good but the texture was not what i was expecting i was expecting a lighter more spongier cake
this is very similar to the recipe i grew up with we waited until the butter and hot milk were added to the batter before putting in the vanillavanilla loses some of its39 flavor under direct heat like hot milk so you39ll get a better vanilla flavor if you add it at the end
an excellent recipe i like to try new recipes when i have just a cup or so of whole milk remaining just to see what i can accomplish i39m rarely disappointed and a search today led me to this one which i will keep it is amazing will top some pieces with some raspberries that i froze at the end of the season last year the canes are already getting ready to produce a new crop and we will enjoy it this evening thank you
so good you can probably get away with putting less sugar in it if you wanted but how much less i know i had to bake it about 10 mins longer than stated but my dad said the best ever had yes i know not white cake but similar
seriously easy super tasty and the perfect way to use up closetodate milk used whole and 2 with perfect success our kids are wild about this cakeespecially when paired with a warm caramel sauce this one is a keeper
does it has to be done 2 milk can it be whole
can you make this in a bundt or tube pan i want to make this tomorrow so if anyone knows please respond asap thank you
hi ili wanted to try this cake just wanted to ask the cup size what is it in grams and also i have a gas cooker so what will be the gas mark for baking it
this is a great cake for strawberry shortcake we usually prefer biscuits but this cake is a nice change i reduce the sugar just a bit 18 cup less as it39s a bit sweet i also add a pinch of salt i bake in a 9 inch pan for 25 minutes check with a toothpick 5 minutes before the directions state you don39t want a dry cake when i sugar my strawberries i keep them a bit tart to offset the sweetness of the cake this is a little bit fussy but it really is a delicious cake
not sure what all the negative comments are about i baked this with very little skill and it turned out absolutely perfect the cake was so soft and wonderful the only thing i did was reduce the sugar to 1 and 14 cup because i frosted the cake please do bake this cake its such a great simple and delicious one
i have used this recipe many times for layer cakes for my birthdays i have added a pinch of salt a few times other times i have poked holes with a chopstick and poured in jello and i have at times dumped a bunch of cocoa powder in with the dry ingredients they have all turned out great i like this cake because it is structurally sound and can withstand icing like a champ use a long bread knife to slice off the slight dome when i use buttercream i do a thin crumb coat stick it in the fridge wash a couple of dishes and then the do the real icing beautiful every time
i realized i never reviewed this recipe and what an oversight that was this cake is amazing so easy too
delicious and different as i was not prepared for the spongelike texture served with lemon curd and whipped cream as with most cake recipes i come across and don39t see salt i added about 13 tsp plus used one 1 tbsp high quality vanilla after greasing glass cake pan i sprinkled it with sugar before adding batter and for me cake took longer to bake than 30 minutes while increased baking time gradually this cake could definitely be substituted for the biscuits in shortcake yum
i made this once and it turned out amazing i have a terrible oven so i set it to 300 and it took longer but worked out i topped mine with strawberry jam has anyone tried making this into a cupcake
i have made this cake multiple times and my family loves it i topped it with strawberries and some whip cream and it is an instant success
healthy recipethank you
this is an excellent cake very tasty goes really well with strawberries
what a delicious cake i halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 inch round cake pan i baked it 25 mins probably could have used another couple of minutes and i should have used butter and flour in the pan instead of spray it did stick but my son and i were instantly addicted my only changes were using whole milk all i had and adding a pinch of salt and btwi also used regular salted butter too this came together so quickly and it is perfect eaten warm
i made this cake for the first time many years ago when my children still lived at home i took it out of the oven and my husband and i had a piece and loved it then our son and his friend and our daughter came home from high school they tried it and loved it then a friend stopped by to drop something off she tried it and loved it as well i39m so glad i still have the recipe
delicious and yes i beat the eggs for 5 full minutes
halved the recipe and made it to accompany strawberries and and whipped cream it was excellent not too sweet and nice and moist will definitely use this one again and again
love it so easy and delicious
i followed the recipe exactly as written and the cake turned out beautifully it was light and tasty it39s not a strong flavored cake but a great light snack or a wonderful dessert with some fruit added to it my husband said that in the words of the great british baking show 34it39s a beautiful sponge34 i will definitely make this cake again sometimes i39ll make it as is and sometimes i39ll play around and add flavors to it or a topping of some kind this is a great cake recipe
really good tasting cake but set your timer for 25 minutes for testing if finished ours baked for 30 stuck to the pan and candies on the perimeter going to try this one again because delish
very yummy a nice combination of moist and light i wish i had fresh strawberries because they would have complimented this perfectly i will definitely make this again for a quick easy simple and delicious dessert
i remember my mama making this cake it is basic and tasty more of a 34pound cake34 than a fluffy cake and really good for snacking she would sometimes frost with buttercream and sprinkle heavily with chopped peanuts sure does bring back memories
if you follow this recipe you39ll get a cake that39s pretty dense the recipe has the right ingredients but the wrong steps for a fluffy cake only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar after that use a spatula to mix everything else in because if you continue to use a mixer you39ll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture which will make it less fluffy also add the milk and butter before the flour because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture if you prefer something less sweet use 125 cups of sugar instead of 2 you could also melt the butter first before stirring in the milk just to make it melt faster
fabulous i didn39t change a thing i put whipped topping and fresh strawberries on top my husband loved it thank you
well i made the recipe tonight nice basic ingredients that i already had and a simple recipe wanted to start a little tradition with my young daughters that they could pass on a simple cake from scratch while it was a little sweet for my own taste they absolutely loved it the texture was spongy and moist and the plain cake was a hit solo i also made a berry compote to add a bit of tartness for my own preference and my and the girls loved that too i guess the key is in proper mixing not a fake review there were a couple negative reviews from socalled that said the cake turned out awful or that the positive reviews were not genuine real mom here
this cake came out exactly as i expected it would the reviews i imagine come from negative haters some people are only happy when ripping others down my suggestion is to learn how to bake before you comment delicious cake and looking forward to some truffle tonight
just made it but follow the instructions due to habit i mixed all dry ingredients before i realized that the way but i added them slowly to the batter and it came out perfectly and is delicious
i followed the recipe exactly as stated but i did add more vanilla and it was delicious will definitely make again i served mine with fresh berries and whip cream
i am 81 an have been baking this cake since i was 12 i have never had it to failever about 40 years ago i started adding a broiled topping and serving with whipped cream it is delicious and loved at the church and quilt potlucks here is broiled topping 112 c packed brown sugar34 c butter 12 c half and half bring to a boil and stir until sugar is dissolved remove and add 2 c coconut and 12 c chopped nuts broil until bubbly and lightly browned make this in the morning so that the topping flavors can meld into the cake
after reading the reviews i changed this around i added a t of vanilla bean paste plus the t of vanilla i used half and half instead of 2 i beat the eggs a long time until they were light and fluffy and then added the sugar and beat again until light and fluffy for quite a bit my batter was smooth and creamy i baked this in a glass baking dish so i reduced my oven temp to 335 when it was done and cooled i made a fresh blueberry compote to serve on top with a dollop of homemade whipped cream but refrigerated whipped topping would work just as well i liked it because a light dessert without heavy frosting to hold it down perfect for a light spring or summer supper
79 we had this cake all the time when i was little to know where my mother got this i still make this now and my kids and grandkids love it the only differents i use 2cups flour 2teaspoon baking soda 1teaspoon salt mix together 2 cups sugar and 2 eggs mix this together 1 cup milk 1tablespoon crisco shortening melt crisco in milk alternate flour mixture and milk do not beat mix well 375 oven 25mins test at 20 mins test with toothpick now we only made a layer cake always this chocolate frosting 4 tablespoon butter 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate melt together 3cups sifted confectioners sugar 1teaspoon vanilla 18 teaspoon salt 13 cup warm milk add not all milk at once to sugar and chocolate mix now add rest of milk frost cake serve warm my mom always put 4 toothpicks to hold cake together who ever gat a toothpick got another piece of cake this tradition still goes own enjoy sandra
i cannot understand how anyone can have a failure with this recipe i39ve been using it for a number of years and it always turns out as shown in fact i made it a few days ago and have given the recipe to two friends because they liked it so well
i love this cake it39s the perfect base for strawberry shortcake or for a topping of any fruit with whipped cream leftovers are great with a cup of coffee in the morning i don39t understand those who had trouble but cakes are one of those things that you have to follow instructions carefully
i39m not sure what the others did wrong but this is an awesome recipe
damien you made my day your statement that of these folks just cook or i am surprised and disappointed at the venom some of these posters spray everyone likes different tastes i understand the hatefulness expressed i guess since people be identified they feel they can say such hateful things about recipe if you do care for a recipe you care for it plain and simple move on and try another recipe
easy recipe great when fresh strawberries are available or peaches or cherries scrape bowl often when adding flour or milk mixture added 1 teaspoon of grated lemon rind with vanilla nice flavor sister likes it with grated orange rind use nonstick foil in pan grab foil and place on cutting board when done no need to clean a pan
my mom has the same recipe but we put chocolate whip cream frosting on it we make it for birthday dinners
i am anxious to try this recipe the one i have made for years and years calls for 2 cups flour 1 cup milk and 1 stick of butter always use butter and flour to grease the pan never a cooking spray as the cake will not rise properly maybe this is the problem for some of the bakers
made this cake today was pretty simple to make served it as a strawberry shortcake i think the cake would also be wonderful to use in a trifle i will save it and make it again
disgusting set properly and had to throw it away waste of ingredients i ignored the bad reviews and thought i could make it work but it turned out rubbish definitely do not recommend use another recipe
it came out exactly as described the negative comments i39d hazard to guess just can39t cook that said i didn39t particularly like it but what do you really expect to get from a hot milk cake ffs
this is a humble cake and it is delicious i have made it numerous times and it comes out perfectly every time i don39t understand how it doesn39t come out for others i make a could of small tweaks i use unsalted butter for all of my baking so i added a teaspoon of salt and whisked it together with the flour baking power and salt before adding them to the batter i used twice the vanilla also i think it makes a big difference if you add ingredients very gradually make sure an addition of flour is almost completely incorporated before adding the next
very bad experience do not try the batter was so lumpy even though i used everything stated above with exact quantity then when i baked it it even rise properly and tasted gross been making hot milk cake with a different recipe but i wanted to try a new recipe and now regretting my decision
ok it looks white and tastes good but i don39t like the inside at all i hate it nasty nasty white cake ever
perfect recipe just follow the procedure and yoi will get a fluffy tasty cake kids so loved it
currently on quarantine lockdown and tired of looking at the same walls went to my cupboards and found i had all ingredients on hand i accidentally added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and combined all the dry ingredients out of habit turned out wonderful adding this to regular rotation
absolutely horrible cake recipe i39ve been baking for a long time and this has to be the worst cake recipe i39ve ever tried a total waste of ingredients i followed the recipe to a t didn39t over mix over fold and it had the worst texture very dense and almost gummy feeling i wish i could give this 0 stars this is the first time i39ve been truly disappointed by a recipe on this site
this came out beautiful and fluffy and moist and delicious i am not a professional baker just a hobby from home and had no problems with the recipe and directions i will have to make this over and over again
this is a real review i39ve been making this exact recipe for many many years at one time i would bake two to feed my family of seven however with just me and my husband now i cut the recipe in half and use a 9x9 pan this is my definite goto recipe for many strawberry shortcake every summerbut love just as much plain out of the oven with powdered sugar sprinkled on top chances are you have every ingredient at home and can whip this up in no time why look for another recipe when you39ve got the best right here
disappointing this recipe calls more liquid than most of other hot milk cake recipes because of numerous good reviews i didn39t doubt to try it i baked twice followed the exact method exact scale of ingredients but both didn39t turn out well note that i didn39t overwhip the eggs or overfold i went to a baking academy and i39ve been baking for more than 5 years if you39re looking for fluffy hot milk cake definitely do not try this recipe if you39re up to really dense dense cake maybe you could try this recipe maybe this is why you shouldn39t take recipes from the internet i highly doubt these good reviews are real as the youtube views for this recipe is considered low i won39t be making these again i39ll try to find other hot milk cake recipes
good amazing and fun
this cake was a bit too sweet on its own for me maybe i incorporate the sugar enough will definitely try again though as a great tasting cake with this sweet batch i ended up layering it with thickened cream and coffee and made a it was delicious
so gorgeous
delicious
loved it 2nd time i varied the recipe a little more vanilla and 12 tsp salt 12 and 12 instead of milk beat the whites replaced the white volume with water to make the batter folded in the whites just as delicious but substantially lighter with out losing the creamy ness
i live in colorado at high altitude
my cake didn39t rise isn39t baking soda needed for helping to rise i didn39t see that in the receipe
good lta href34httpsscoopkeedacomvideobananewalaappsdownload34 target34blank34gtinformationltagt i need deep recipe about this
this is an excellent cake made it just as recipe instructed you need to have oven preheated when making this cake it needs to go into the oven as quickly as possible while the batter is still warm i think it rises better that way
quick and easy to make i used chai instead of milk to turn it into a chai cake i added some spices with the dry ingredients too it39s a bit sweet so i paired it with a less sweet icing i think cream cheese icing or icing made of instant pudding mix and thickened cream would be nice
this cake is so easy to make it39s top off a meal nicely oldfashioned goodness
my mother made this when i was growing up in the 3930s amp 3940s her recipe is almost exactly the same as this one she filled the layers and topped the cake with what i know now was a thick lemon curd delicious
this recipe has become a family favorite i39m making it today for my daughter39s 22nd birthday when i told her she was overjoyed this cake is absolutely delicious no frosting at all it39s so quick to make that i can throw it into the oven after dinner and have a delicious dessert in no time i don39t let it cool too much because we think it tastes best when it is hot
made this cake it was great topped it with brown sugar frosting everyone loves it everyone must try brown sugar frosting just cut the powdered sugar in half and it has the perfect amount of sweetness
wow i was very impressed with the texture and taste of this cake it was great served with fresh fruit and next time i may serve it with lemon curd sooo easy
i just tried it and it is amazing however i used selfraising flour and baking powder and it came soft like a chiffon cake simply amazing
i have made this cake for years as my base for trifle i split the cake in half and place in bottom of glass bowl sprinkle with a liqueur that matches my fruit cover with jam or cooked fruit add pudding and repeat layers then cover with sweetened whipped cream it always disappears quickly
very disappointed with this recipe i bake a lot and this recipe looked very interesting but not what i expected it was very dense i was expecting it to be much lighter i followed the recipe exactly if you want light and fluffy and moist this is not the cake for you
this cake brings bake so many sweet childhood memories when my family was so close my aunt france39s use to make got milk cake 27th walnuts inside and chocolate icingthat was my favorite part of the holidaysi still make themcooking one tidat
the first time that i made this cake i used all purpose flour and all i could taste was the flour the cake was dense even though it rose beautifully the second time that i made this cake i used swans down cake flour and it made a huge difference in the flavor and the texture i also used this recipe to make 36 cupcakes i baked them at 325 degrees for exactly 20 minutes and they came out perfect this is going to be my 34go to34 recipe every time i make a cake or cupcakes
i just made my moms recipe for hot milk cake and decided to search for variations i was reading the reviews and i just wanted to take the time to say please do not follow the advice given by jacksjojo i wish there was a way to report it you cannot can anything with eggs milk or flour even if you could these directions are not an appropriate way of canning just because the lid seals does not mean that is safe you could potentially die of botulism or worse kill someone else when you give it as a gift
love homemade milk cake
i have been making this cake for over 25 years it is one of my husband39s favorites i do use salted butter if you don39t have salted butter just add 12 tsp salt and i use 1 tbs of vanilla the mixture is thin but it works perfectly i usually make it in a bundt pan just because we like it that way too thin for a tube pan i like to make this to add to gift baskets use 6 to 7 pint size wide mouth jars grease inside fill about 23 full place on a pan to bake 350 about 18 mins or until touch test works place lids and rings on as soon as you can after removing from the oven they will seal tighten after jars have cooled if sealed they will be good for at 23 months in cabinet enjoyi have tried to give this 5 stars but it just won39t let me could be me
my grandmother made a cake very similar to this which she topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream when i saw fresh strawberries on special yesterday at the grocery store i thought of her cake and found this recipe the taste and smell were so familiar the recipe was easy to make and tasted great i also served some of the cake topped with chocolate icing and it was fantastic too this recipe will become a permanent addition to my recipe collection it39s very versatile and oh so easy and tasty
i poked holes n the top of the cake and poured some cream of coconut over the top oh so moist i did a change tho39 i didn39t put 2 cups of sugar in it i is a diabetic i used 1 cup of sugar had rave reviews from every1 loved it
delicious easy too i would like to hear about some different frosting ideas for it i did like it plain and also with a little powdered sugar i39m just curious
i got the credit of making a tasty cake
this is the perfect cake to top with your favorite fruit topping i take it to almost every summer time picnic and it never fails to disappear
i am 71 and this was my favorite cake growing up this was the base for our strawberry shortcake my mother also made it with a maple fudge frosting which i loved when i started to make it at age 10 my mother couldn39t understand why mine always tasted better than hers we found out why years later when i discovered that i had misread her recipe and was adding twice the butter to this day i still misread her recipeyummmmm
my mom had made this cake for many many years it was one of her recipes that relatives new she would bring to a shower or to a special family gathering she made a hot brown sugar sauce for the topping on the cake for an after sunday dinner desert or sometimes with boiled frosting we were always wondering when she made it was this cake for us or was it leaving the housecomfort food from our childhood i guess
simple and delicious simply delicious definitely a keeper i followed this recipe to the t and it is fabulous we will enjoy this for many years to come
great cake works every time now make it as muffins as everyone wants more makes 24 so enough for everyone
this is an excellent cake for a pineapple or peach upside own cake not too heavy and it makes enough batter for two cakes or make the second cake into something else like boston cream cake
nice
my family loved it i wasn39t sure it would turn out but it was delicious i served it with chocolate ice cream
do you use salted or unsalted butter also someone mentioned that it39s better with salt but i don39t see salt listed in the ingredients do you add salt thanks
this is d best cake everlove d recipe
we have been making hot milk cakes in our family for more than 75 years it is an easy tasty cake and you can add coco powder 12 cup or more to taste and make a chocolate hot milk cake delicious
i followed the instruction exactly like it was written without adding any salt the results were still great though i would agree to add a little salt next time could be as a base for any birthday cake with any thingflavour added spongy and moist at the same time i will make it again for sure
love the recipe its a keeper will make often and don39t see why some people don39t like it crazy
very yummy and so easy i only used 1 amp 12 c sugar and added 2 tsp vanilla and a little salt it has a great consistency thanks for sharing this will be one of our favorites now
this is pretty decent but the magnolia bakery39s vanilla birthday cake is very similar to this and i do like the texture better i would make this again though it is quick and easy to make
i thought this cake was really easy to make and came out great the texture is both spongy and slightly dense at the same time i followed other reviewers39 suggestions to add a smidge more vanilla and a pinch of salt i did also add about 12 tsp of rum extract because i thought the batter tasted good but needed a little something you could really use this cake as a base and add any type of extract or flavoring you39re in the mood for i also agree with the others who said it39s very important to beat the eggs for the full 5 minutes maybe even a little longer i also made sure i beat the sugar and eggs until they were nice and airy too 35 minutes in the oven was perfect the cake tastes great on its ownespecially when it39s still warmbut i plan on serving it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream later can39t wait
great recipe but with the omissions i deleted 2 stars for taste i would give it 4 i am an experienced baker and made this recipe as written except for the notes i made belowif someone were a novice baker this should be a simple enough recipe but it will not turn out as expected unless you recognize andor correct the followingsalt salt is necessary unless you are using salted butter most people bake with unsalted butter since it allows the baker to control the salt in the recipe this recipe may have been written for use with salted butter but since it is not noted to use salted butter instead of the usual unsalted it will come out bland without the addition of salt i added 12 tsp and it came out perfectbatter my batter was unusually runny i would even call it watery i have made cakes with very runny batter previously but i was unsure if this was one of those super moist types since the recipe didn39t mention the consistency of the batter i added 12 cup of ap flour just to be on the safe side and it came out very dense and moist without a lot of rise your results may vary however
this is to die for i don39t know what happened to the others that said this had no flavor as it is so sweet and delicious now i just need some strawberries yum thanks for the fantastic recipe
great recipe i made it tonight and the cake came out delicious
loved it very easy to make light amp fluffy
simple oldfashioned delicious cake would be great to use for strawberry shortcake as others have mentioned somewhat reminiscent of a good 34twinkie34 sponge
this is a great recipe adding some lemon zest gives a nice light lemon taste top with berries and cream or cinnamon and sugar yummmm i love this cake very easy to make and flavor anyway you please
awesome
this cake is delicious as a snack cake without frosting or topping because it is more dense than regular cake we like to use this recipe for strawberry shortcake it is sooo good
i never add baking soda or powder to my baked good because it makes it taste like soap so i didn39t add it it39s similar to pound cake very moist
did not like this one
i was hoping that this recipe would be a real winner being that it got previous rave reviews but i was very disappointed this cake lacked in flavor and sweetness and was too dense the only saving grace was the frosting but then we decided that it still wasn39t worth it so it went into the trash back to the drawing board
expellant recipe
u need to mix the eggs really good and the sugar we loved the cake
i made this yesterday if it wasn39t for the chocolate frosting i would of thrown it out it is so heavy and not much flavor to it we didn39t like it
i have been making this cake for over 30 years or more it is my daughters favorite and always asked for it for her 34birthday34 cake
grandma cake add cinnamon or whatever spice you like
super easy and super fun to make yummymy first cake enjoyed the experienceit was just perfect
was easy and definitely yummy
perfect i39ve used it for over 20 years
this cake was so easy to make and very tasty i only had skim milk and it turned out great my girlfriend loves cake but doesn39t like frosting so i was trying to find something tasty enough for me to enjoy and this was it i think it would be good drizzled with maple syrup or corn syrup though and dusted with a little powder sugar if you wanted to dress it up
this was a fun cake to makevery simply and very good didn39t miss the frosting at all
i tried this recipe today it turned out good amp was very delish
it tastes so good and so easy to make
i can remember my mom baking hot milk cake she would spread karo syrup on top it was so delicious
i added a little of canolli dip in to it and its amazingly good
we love this cake it has been our family 34birthday cake34 for as long as i can remember everyone loves iti use almond instead of vanilla usually serve it plain but sometimes dust it with powdered sugari39ve been making this cake since i was old enough to be in the kitchen i39m well past retirement age now
very nice and fluffy my family loved it soft and spongy i added 3 tablespoons of coco powder to theflour and it turned out really well thanks for such sweet recipe
i tried this recipe and it came so good perfect for my daughter thanks for sharing im planning to add more butter next time ill make this to have more butter taste and to add more vanilla and salt too same as the other did to their cake
i tried this recipe and it turned out very nice and tasty
awesome lovely texture flavor and crumb
when you39re raising 6 kids you need lots of delicious inexpensive recipes to fill up all those tummies this recipe was one of our family39s favorites when all the kids were growing up so easy to top it with fruit to make it a little more special but everyone loved it just as it is easy to make amp delicious
literally just finished cooking it definately came out light and fluffy inlove with this cake already added blue food colouring to make it a little different and after reading some reviews i ended up adding 14 salt and it came out perfect thanks to everyone for their reviews it really made the cake work
this is a great cake very moist and flavorful it does need to cook longer than the directions say at least in my oven don39t rely on the toothpick test or it won39t be cooked it should spring back if you touch it the top should be golden brown and then it39s done i used boiled peanut butter frosting which was more like fudge it was for a family birthday party and it disappeared fast
i tried this recipe and it came out really well i was short of 1 egg but the outcome was still good thanks for sharing
i think what the reviews with low stars are missing is quality ingredients the first time i made this i made no alterations and it was perfect i topped with some homemade peach marmalade and that added just enough sweetness that coffee goes perfect with it now i do use farm fresh eggs fresh dairy milk and fresh dairy butter so i39m thinking that that has something to do with it with 34old34 recipes it makes a huge difference
read the reviews and was a little nervous to make this i added the 14 tsp of salt and i changed the vanilla to 2 tablespoons it turned out very good it39s a good 34base cake34 plenty of options came to mind after i tasted it
this cake is awesome i did add 14 tsp salt to the recipe amp increased vanilla to about 2 tsp sprinkled with powdered sugar amp served with fresh strawberries and cream unbelievably delicious sometimes i want sweet but not too sweet this does it i like this better than pound cake because it39s lighter amp softer
my granny made this cake all the time for my pappy it was from scratch amp made in a pyrex bowl smaller scale but what she did that made it so great was to add while hot the coconut and brown sugar icing while the cake is baking in a pan she melted 6 t butter 34 c brown sugar 3 t milk and 12 to 1 c coconut bring to a boiling point and pour over the warm cake i punch holes in mine to let it seep in heaven i have to tell you that i have looked for this recipe for years and this is as close to my granny39s as you can get thank you for the recipe so to those ladies who complained sorry but cake is priceless to me
3 stars to make a comment no salt i39ve been comparing this recipe to many others on the internet and this is the only one without salt i would guess this is why some other reviewers find this cake bland
extremely plain and flavorless i have a favorite yellow cake recipe but always like to try new things just in case something better might come along this was disappointing to say the least i even added extra vanilla and a touch of cinnamon because the batter tasted like a boxed pancake mix and i always spice up my pancakes if you like plain bland cake then this is for you
always requested by my children for their birthdays since it first came out in toh in 1993 truly delicious especially hot out of the oven i look forward to making it for my grandchildren someday if you39re looking for something especially sweet this isn39t it to me this is more like the flavor of a shortbread cookie great with a hot cup of tea as one reviewer commented
good for my homework on a recipe with milk i have tasted this and it is good
made this cake yesterday very easy to make and is absolutely delicious i served it with strawberries and my husband loved it i will be making this one again
could you tell me if you have ever put this in a bundt pan instead of the 13x9 pan
great cake just like mother used to make
just baked this cake and my husband loved it it was very easy to make and delicious too
i just had a question but had to add a star to ask it so i gave it 1 star do you think this would be a good base for tres leches cake
i searched out this recipe because it39s an old favourite of my husbands his mom made it often and he missed it he loved this and said it was even better than his moms you have to know what kind of untouchable reputation his mom has in his mind for baking to know what compliment this is lol the only thing i didn39t different was use lemon extract instead of vanilla and made a simple glaze with lemon zest in it i think that the people that have bad reviews maybe over heated the milk which destroys the entire cake
i have made this cake on several occassions and it is a fantastic cake it39s halfway between a sponge and a pound cake it39s also a great base for cakes as suggested by others i cannot believe some people think it39s an awful cake i have suggested this recipe to many people when they comment on how nice it is definitely worth a try
tender and moist the very best cake for strawberry shortcake i39ve ever tried
it is a great cake but as a coffee cake or base of lemon curd cake pineapple upside down cake or strawberry shortcake i will make it again
we39ve used this recipe for years for strawberry shortcake
i was so excited to try this cake followed the recipe to a t i cannot understand why it has good reviewsit is horrible utterly horrible i would not recommend this to anyone i cook all the time in case anyone thinks i am a newbiei am not this recipe just is not worth making awful
it39s so delicious my kids just loved it
easy to make looks exactly like the picture taste is sweet and blah
this was not one of my favorite cake recipes
this was not one of my favorite cakes
i made this cake for my husband39s birthday when i read the recipe i was skeptical as i had never heard of hot milk cake i decided to try it because of all the great reviews it was a bit more work than my usual yellow cake recipe but it was well worth it this is the fluffiest cake i have ever made it was moist and light i followed the recipe exactly i think that beating the eggs for the full five minutes is essential i made two 8x8 cakes and froze one for another day i served the other one with fresh strawberries and light whipped cream my husband raved about it this is my new favourite cake recipe
love this cake
great tasting old fashioned textured cakeplain or dusted with powdered sugar and fruit toppingdelish
glorious so simple and so good a real discovery moist tasty great consistency and it keeps great i suspect the time invested beating the eggs paid off thanks a lotand to those considering whether to bake it or not do it there is no going back
i did a demo in high school home ec on this cake my recipe is very close to this 46 years ago and i still make it the ingred are usually on hand its fast and wonderful with fruit it is so adaptable i have added plain blueberries to it serve with fresh strawberries and whip cream instead of those dry round things your family will never want to go back i have also used pinapple cooked with small amount of sugar and cornstarch for a great topping cooled it and then top with whip cream and sprinkle with coconut my recipe makes a smaller cake and only uses 1 c flour 1 t baking powder 14 t salt 2t butter 12 c hot milk i use buttermilk 2 eggs 1 c sugar and 1 t vanilla directions same except for 9x9 pan 350 degrees for 25 min just the right size for a small quick dessert for fresh fruit
lost my hot milk cake recipe years ago had been making it since i was 9 yrs old now 68 had come from my grandmotheri will try this one hope it is the same sounds right thank you
i have been looking for a recipe that fits the picture description of this cake for quite some time firm fine crumb spongy soft texture and this recipe delivered it is fantastic worked as a cake worked as cupcakes i have 150 pages of yellow cake recipes and this one immediately has jumped to page1 i do have a question does anyone have baking times for baking 634 834 and 934 round versions my first attempt at a round 634 was still not done after 25 minutes and unfortunately i could not leave it baking any longerany advice would be appreciatedthanks again for the great recipe

i loved it especially for a tight budget it39s light and yet really satisfied my sweet tooth i also love how versatile it iscan go with anything andor you can adapt it to anything
i just finished making this recipe and it39s definitely going to become my goto cake recipe i cut the recipe in half and used a 9x9 glass dish and cut off like 10 minutes of baking time and i am so pleased with the results a perfect spongy cake very easy to make and not time consuming at all
i used to make this as a teenager because it was so eash to make and always turned out well my problem was that the batter was so good i would eat a lot of it before it ever hit the oven
my husband had had this cake as a child and wanted me to find a recipe so i turned to toh he loved this when i made it and said it was even better than he recalled it it was moist light and airy very very good with or without frosting
moist delicious and easy to make cake i will definitely make this cake again
absolutley love the flavour of this cake my first try turned out more like a pound cake probably because i may have overmixed when adding the hot milk mixture to the flour but as i like a heavier density cake i am ok with that i will definitely make again
moist amp delicious hot milk cake recipe i baked it in a jelly roll pan amp it turned out great
pjust made this today and it is a good basic cake that is easy and quick i baked my in a bundt pan for about 5055 minutes i only had whole milk used organic unsalted butter decreased the sugar to 1 12 cups increased the vanilla to 2 tsp added 14 tsp salt my mother was an excellent baker and even when the recipe didn39t call for salt she always put a little in all her baked goods i also added a 12 tsp of king arthurs princess cake and cookie flavoring the cake is similar to a pound cake but not quite i sprinkled it with confectioners sugar and will be serving it with fresh strawberries and whip cream next time i will try making cupcakes i39ll let you know if it doesn39t work but i have a feeling it willp
so simple amp so easy my husband loved it amp is very picky when it comes to white cake will have fresh fruit on the side next time this pairs well with cream cheese frosting
so good my kids loved iti reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup and it turned good
i did this cakeit was so good and my kids loved itits light and deliciousi reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup and it turned very good
so delicious my entire family loved it the cake disappeared immediately
excellent cake i am so glad for the reviews or i would not have made this cake and that would have been our loss thanks for the recipes and the especially the reviews they so make a difference
i made this cake and loved it thanks for sharing it
i39ve been making this cake for years since i got the recipe from another poster on a cooking forum i used it as my wedding cakeit is not as light and fluffy as cake mix cakes and does have somewhat the consistency of pound cake i like that and it makes it sturdy enough for stacking and decorating multiple layersbe sure to beat the eggs the full 5 minutes called for or it will be extremely dense
the cake tasted good but it was not light and fluffy it was heavey and had the texture of a pound cake can anyone tell me what may have caused this
so i have made this one several times now and turned out great each time made as is used lemon butter coconut instead of vanilla lol not all at once and have added cocoa all have been yummy and easy to make
very tasty cake will make again and again next time i would like to try a little cinnamon in it also very tasty dunked into hot chocolate my son wants to try putting a little cocoa in it yum can39t wait to try many different ideas
great recipe i like light fluffy cakes so i added some more baking powder and add a little baking soda
great easy to make and lots of fun to eat
this is one of our favorite cakes to have during the week i sprinkle powder sugar on it before serving it
this is a super good cake i use it for strawberry shortcake and it has always been a big hit at my home it is great plain too try it you39ll love it
amazing simple and delicious it39s my family39s favorite
i was searching on line for a hot milk cake recipe a few days ago and came across this one i was delighted with it i decided to make it as a layer cake and put a seedless strawberry jam in the center then after putting the top on i made a chocolate glaze to drizzle over it we really did enjoy this i also used whole milk instead of the 2
all my family member n my self love
this has the taste and texture of the pound cake i remember as a child absolutely delicious
fabulous recipe i use plain soy milk and it turns out great in fact i39m eating some now with peach ice cream and fresh berries yum
this was so good i swirled a 12 pint of home made strawberry jam in before baking but i think next time i39ll make two layers and put the jam in between the layers i didn39t have quite enough butter and it still turned out great very tender light crumb i really like this recipe thank you
excellent cake i made coconutpecan frosting for on it mmmmm
i made this and loved it its simple and yet still good and shes right it would work great with any fruit and even as a strawberry shortcake but for simple its still yummy and you can eat it without frosting
this is a really tasty cake plain but i see some cherry sauce in it39s future
not very exciting it reminded me of eating the sponge cake part of a twinkie without the fun of the cream filled center would make a good cake base for a fruit topping but it doesn39t stand up well alone
my 11 yr old daughter makes this and without fail it disappears fast
fabulous cake i made this as the base for strawberry shortcake with fresh strawberries and cool whip it was a big hit thanks for the recipe god bless
by the way my second attempt was not as successful as the first cake did not rise as high and i have found that beating the eggs well is very importantyou may need to beat more than five minutes
made this early one sunday morning when my daughter and granddaughter came up stairs for breakfast my daughter told her daughter that it was breakfast cake and she ate it the following sunday she asked if we could have breakfast cake again yes we did
my mther called this 34a hot milk sponge cake34 we had it with strawberries every summer for years it39s fantastic
this is my favorite cake since 1993 my family loves it i am making it today for my 70th birthday tomorrow love it
i thought this cake was good but not really anything to rave about if i ever make it again i will probably make a frosting for it poke holes into it for pudding or cut it up to be used in some other sort of dessert
made this cake for the first time and it was to die for dusted some powdered sugar on the top next time might add some lemon extract and zest to the batter
this is one of my favourite cake recipes my boys always request it for their birthday it is so easy and has a fantastic flavour and texture
we served this for my daughter39s graduation it has a wonderful flavor and texture
have been using this for strawberry shortcake very good
i too have been making this cake since the first issue of taste of home hit the newsstand love it plain but it39s also great with strawberries and whipped cream on top
yummy my 5yearold helped me make this the texture reminds me a bit of angel food cake but not 34chewy34 very sweet without any frosting or anything added
this is the best cake i have ever had the ingredients are simple and readily available recipe is easy to make
love this cake it was in the first issue of taste of home and it has been a staple in my home both my boys love it
delicious we just made this cake today
i love this recipe the cake is sweet on its own so it39s nice to add some whipped cream for a lighter treat
how do you think this would be with cheese tortellini
i loved the flavor and texture of this salad not too sweet or too much vinegar which is a common issue i have with coleslaws the ratio of dressing to slaw is perfect i didn39t have to make any changes to get it right 5 stars
after reading a lot of the five star reviews i made a double recipe for a church potluck picnic exactly as posted it was good but not great was the opinion of quite a few people luckily there were a lot of people so i only had a small bowl leftover if i make it again i would greatly reduce or omit the vinegar in the dressing and not use the water chestnuts since i asked and no one tasted them in the salad maybe using sliced or slicing the whole and not chopping would have made a difference
very nice combination and very tasty the only change i made was using a red pepper instead of a green pepper personal choice as others have said this recipe does make a lot i halved the recipe and filled a 2 qt bowl several guests asked for the recipe will definitely be adding this to my recipe collection
made this today for a group of cowboys to go along with chili and cornmeal muffins it was well received this will be my go to salad recipe from now on i may add cubed cheddar cheese for the next time and for a more summer type salad i39ll try adding sliced grapes oh so yummy thank you
really like this make it very often hard to find whole water chestnuts so i use sliced and cut them in half i usually take the seeds out of the cucumbers with small scoop but probably not necessary this is great for pot lucks
can you make it the day before
i would make this again quite a nice salad enjoyed by my family tasty combination of coleslaw and macaroni salad good dressing used mayo i typically don39t purchase bagged coleslaw i shredded cabbage and carrots i left out the cucumbers
left out cucumber and used mayo instead it makes alot so it was perfect for neighborhood get together everyone loved will make again
i39ve made this for almost all summer potlucks for a few years and everyone loves it even people who claim to dislike miracle whip it does make a huge batch but my friends ask to take some home when there are leftovers and my picky husband will eat it for days
absolutely delicious i love this recipe this is 2 of my favorite parts of summer coleslaw and pasta salad i never thought of putting them together this was an instant favorite in my house the only change i made was i grated fresh carrots and used fresh cabbage
wow i39ve never heard of macaroni coleslaw love finding new recipes
made this recipe and was really surprised at how good it was definitely a keeper
when reading this recipe mixing pasta and coleslaw seemed a bit odd to me we like pasta salad and we like coleslaw but together just didn39t seem right i stand corrected it is quite tasty and i will definitely be making it again i did swapped out mayonnaise for the miracle whip recipe does make a large amount
this is my goto recipe for a great picnic salad i39ve brought it to campouts backyard bbq39s pot lucks and i39ve made it for just me and my family it39s simple and absolutely delicious
this is one of my family39s favorite salads and i make it quite often during the summer but we do have it yearround so easy to prepare and it does make a lot definitely a keeper
i used farfalle noodles i like it
made this at camp was a huge hit
super salad wondered what i was going to do with the case of kraft macaroni and cheese i bought from costco because it had been when i was seven along with spagetti i obviously grow up in a household where mom liked to cook anyway the kraft noodles were just the right size i like sweet dressings so bottled poppyseed or the recipe from broccoli madness go great the packages of three color coleslaw make this super quick
excellent
pretty salad that is very tasty adding this to 34family favorites34
this salad is a winner i used a package of broccoli carrot and cabbage mix and red pepper in place of the green i also added craisins an used maria callen
this recipe was super good and easy i believe the yield says twelve but i assure you it would serve many more i brought this up to my cabin during the fourth of july and it really went well with every main dish we made i didn39t have cider vinegar or celery so i went without and i still thought it was delicious i would definetely bring it to a potluck to share with friends
great recipe i make this a lot when i39m having a crowd for dinner start out with a very large bowli made a mistake in not realizing how much this makes and had to change bowls three times for everything to fit the dressing is outstanding
man this salad was awesome i knew i would like it because of the ingredients but when my husband whose system tolerate lettuce took a fork of it and liked it i was definitely sold to top off the flavors i added raisins and it was a show stopper
sooo very good even better next day made for a friend of mine and she said the same things about it oh and my husband also i may even try to add some finely chopped broccoli to it also
made this last year 3 times and everyone loved it the water chestnuts are in the asian food section they really add a great crunch i used mayo dont like miracle whip i make the day before
we loved this recipe i am going to try it and add some dungeness crab or shrimp and make it a dinner
i made this tonight but cut it in half for the two of us i find the water chestnuts and i added red pepper along with green really really good
i made this recipe but halved it since there were only two of us it was absolutely delicious sweet and tangy and the pasta fit right in i was unsure how it was going to be i loved this and would make it again
i made this as directed including using miracle whip for a potluck everyone loved it being a hellmann39s lover that39s what i used the next time i made it big mistake it didn39t taste the same so for now on it39s miracle whip
absolutely delicious perfect for a potluck i do think it would be great with tunachicken etc will definitely be making again
this is really good and makes a substantial amount for a pot luck i39m wondering about adding tuna cooked chicken ham pepperoni or maybe even cooked shrimp for a summertime luncheon meal i also like that one other poster added dried cranberries
delicious
thanks for the inspiration i changed it up a bit and used red onion green and red bell peppers skipped the cucumber and water chestnuts i also cheated and used coleslaw dressing to make this in a pinch lastly i added craisins this served a crowd and the combo of crunchy slaw and pasta was delicious next time try the homemade dressing
excellent i used regular mayo nice mix of pasta and coleslaw great dressing
this is very good my husband really liked it and described it as 34fresh34 i used light mayo 12 of a larger red onion and no water chestnuts nice make ahead salad the dressing was lighter than i expected a good thing maybe the light mayo
i39ve made this twice now and it is always a hit it has quickly become a family favorite perfect for a potluck
yummy makes a large batch i do not care for miracle whip on sandwiches but figured the sweet flavor would work well in a coleslaw and it does i used 12 of a small vidalia onion rather than 2 whole onions seeded the cucumber before dicing it used 12 the suggested sugar and thinned the dressing with a little milk i cut up the coleslaw mix into smaller pieces and wilted it combined coleslaw mix with the salt placed it in a colander and pressed the mix with a weighted plate for about an hour or so before combining with remaining ingredients this is a wonderful potluck dish anyone who likes coleslaw should enjoy this recipe
i found this a very pleasing salad and have made it twice now the first time i stuck to the recipe and found it sweet but the vinegar also played off that sweetness the second time i cut the sugar while i thought it was still very good there was something to be said for the sweet against the tang either way it is good
you know the recipe is good when you bring home an empty bowl and people ask for the recipe
really enjoyed
not a fan of cole slaw but love this salad the crunch from the veggies and adding the pasta make it so good my new favorite summertime salad
what a tasty combination who doesn39t like cole slaw or macaroni salad this is my new 34go to34 recipe for pot lucks funeral receptions and family gatherings i omit the water chestnuts as they don39t seem to offer much taste and there is plenty of crunch without them i also have begun substituting marie39s cole slaw dressing refrigeration section of grocery store in that i believe it has just the right tang this has been a popular salad wherever i39ve brought it thank you sandra for sharing a real winner
excellent recipe a little different than the traditional cabbage salad i use mayonnaise and tarragon vinegar joyce moynihan volunteer field editor
i have been making this for years minus the water chestnuts i am often requested to bring my 34funeral salad34 to church when a luncheon is being served following a funeral it is so well liked i39ll try adding the water chestnuts next time
wonderful summer salad i used mayo
if you substitute tarragon vinegar for the cider vinegar this dish goes to the next level
new favorite salad
this recipe is a big hit at any gathering i added a little shredded cheddar cheese and bacon bits and it was a big hit
i love salads like this except that now it39s almost impossible to find the little ring noodles last time i needed them i had to order them from amazon what is up with that
excellent salad even better with cubed cheddar cheese addedgives it more flavor
this salad was easy to prepare it and it makes quite a bit perfect for a crowd it was bland for me i feel like it needed more seasoning might try some seasoned salt next time
omg this is so good instantly became a new family favorite will definitely be making this often over the summer and all year through excellent
this is delicious and makes enough for quite a good sized group people love it when i bring it to a potluck
i was so surprised at how good this is i made it for a church potluck i was not so sure about it with the peppers and cucumbers but would not change this in anyway
i wouldn39t adjust anything and typically i am a mayonnaise fan this recipe is so tasty i will definitely copy it and put in my old fashioned recipe box as a keeper thanks
something a little different but so tasty i halved the recipe but next time will make a full batch was wellreceived at our barbecue
sooooooo good i had to go out and get the miracle whip even though i had mayo made it and it was all gone in a couple of days and its only my husband and i i did decrease the sugar a little just because i don39t like slaw that sweet but this will definitely be made over and over again
this was a great recipe the only change was substituting mayonnaise for the miracle whip everyone loved it no leftovers
we don39t like water chestnuts but wanted that crunch factor so we added a chopped up apple instead try it
this is such a different take on either a coleslaw or a macaroni salad the best of both worlds i didn39t change a thing and i really like the miracle whip dressing
is that 1amp12 cups or just 12 cup of miracle whip light112 cups miracle whip light
a fresh salad pasta adds a new twist
i made this for a baby shower and everybody raved about how good it was i added fresh dill lots intimation crab 12 of the onion and red onion instead of yellow and i used mayonnaise
i used mayonnaise instead of the miracle whip and added some salt and pepper good coleslaw recipe but now i want to find a recipe for the reversemacaroni salad with a bit of coleslaw mixed in
i doubled recipe and my husband took it to his weekly softball gamepotluck he just came home with the huge bowl completely empty i followed the recipe except used best foods mayo and added celery salt instead of regular salt also added a bit of coleman39s dry mustard and celery seed like i would have for my usual coleslaw anyhow it was obviously a big hit this might be my weekly potluck contribution from now on i wish i did not work on game days
my husband and i really enjoyed this recipe we are not miracle whip fans so i did substitute mayonnaise i also cut the recipe back quite a bit for the two of us this recipe is a nice twist on traditional coleslaw and i will definitely be making it again
big hit made it twice and will be making it again
very good it does make alot will make again
i make this for my club meetings i use a vidalia chop wizard it makes it easy to chop up everything the bowl always comes home empty everyone including myself seems to really like it thank you so much for a good recipe
hubby made this for a company healthy living salads contest and i was lucky to get a cup to try he used fullfat miracle whip and packaged precooked rigatoni that he chopped up which was a little chewier than homemade he cut the onion to one and used a mild onion the chopping is a chore to say the least but he likes doing putzy stuff like that using sliced water chestnuts would trim some of the time off since he made it the night before the dressing and onions had time to mellowexchanges i39d make in the future would be half miracle whip and half yogurt trying plain and then lemon for salad meal i39d add add cheese cubes ham chicken summer sausage that lonely hotdog and sunflower or pumpkin seeds maybe whole grain pasta fresh or frozen peas maybe pineapple tidbits or tomatoesthis was good as is but can be used as a base to expand ingredients
i39ve made the recipe many times as writtenit is very good everyone wants the recipe it39s so nice to give a great review to the actual recipenot how it39s been modified into something totally different
i didn39t care for it it sounded good i thought i would like it it makes a lot i took it to a large gathering and brought a lot of it home i will never make it again
excellent everyone really loved it only difference i made was using mayo instead of miracle whip
very good worth chopping up all the veggies
i just made this saladawesome i didn39t put the chestnuts in the salad i don39t like them i will make this again
i like both coleslaw and macaroni salad but i thought this might be really odd to taste i added green onion and red onion instead of onion i omitted the green pepper and water chestnuts i added 2 chopped fine hard boiled eggs to it in the end i also sprinkled a bit of turmeric to it this is absolutely delicious i love it thanks for the recipe even if i made it my own try it its sooooo good
delicious i made this for a church cook out yesterday and it earned rave reviews it makes a lot so it is a handy recipe to have on hand when you are looking to serve a crowd folks liked the additional vegetables along with the macaroni and cabbage i used mayonnaise red onion and green onion along with red bell pepper it is a very adaptable recipe
this was very yummy
i served this for 4th of july yesterday i thought i39d like it better than i did it made a lot which was a plus but it was really missing something in the flavor i found it unappealing and wished i39d served something else inhad 12 people for dinner people ate it i had half a bowl left over my husband said it was okay and that he liked it well enough but i didn39t notice anyone really excited about it too bad it sounded like something i39d likeperhaps i39d like it with a different dressing i think the dressing was a deal breaker for me maybe i39ll try it again but use a favorite coleslaw dressing on it instead also i wasn39t crazy about the chestnuts if i do it again i39ll use chopped jicama instead
fresh taste and crunchy yum i was looking for something a little different and this did the trick i did not add the water chestnuts and reduced the onion
this was so good i don39t think i will ever make just plain coleslaw again
very delicious substituted green peas for the green peppers and loved it used whole wheat pasta amp mayo amp splenda amp seasoned with white pepper amp celery salt pasta box was 12 oz so increased amount of dressing by adding some olive oil amp more cider vinegar amp sweetener amp seasoningsperfecto thanks for sharing
this is a wonderful recipe very full of flavor and texture it has become a new family favorite thanks for sharing
mix together macaroni salad and coleslaw the perfect way to up each dish
this tasted really good and fresh has the taste of regular slaw but adding the pasta really brings it all together makes a large amount and it takes a huge bowl to mix it in definitely will make again
the macaroni coleslaw was the bomb i doubled up on the recipe so i would have enough for a crowd
made as directed this is amazing everyone love it
made this today it39s now my new favorite salad delicious my family loved it it was easy to make but let me warn you it makes a lot thanks for sharing
i haven39t made it yet but sounds promising
wonderful love it my family loved it too
edit made with miracle whip light was much better especially the next daythis looks and sounds unappetizing but intrigued by the numerous 5 star reviews i went ahead and made it i only had low fat mayo no miracle whip so i used that i only put one onion in because it looked like a lot but might add half or all of the second onei was expecting it to taste like coleslaw and macaroni salad i think it pretty much tastes like coleslaw with a bit of pasta added it makes a ton
this is an awesome dish i made it as directed except the onion i only used one and it was plenty will make this again
i have never been a coleslaw lover but this sounded interesting i loved it my husband also loved it it stays crunchy for several days i did cut it down because it was only 2 of us and i left out the green pepper because i don39t like that flavor but i will be making this again
a nice change
very tasty and crunchy i don39t miss the full fat version of miracle whip at all i used only one onion and that flavor still comes through i also omitted the water chestnuts for my husband but it still has a nice crunchy texture
a wonderful tangy salad i love salads using miracle whip as they are so much more flavourful than mayonnaise the crunch of the water chestnuts is wonderful i use tricolour coleslaw and leave out the green peppers as i dont like them
i used best foods mayonaise instead of miracle whip and i really love the salad my husband doesn39t like macaroni salad and he would still rate it a 4 took it camping and it was just as good on day 4
wasn39t a favorite i didn39t care for the vinegary taste wasn39t creamy enough i39m sure if you are a huge coleslaw fan you would love this recipe
even my non coleslaw liking kids loved this recipe made dressing exactly as written except i used colored spiral rotini and red pepper for color liked it even more the next day
i added crispy bacon to this and it was wonderful
i was so disappointed with this recipe it tasted like sugar and vinegar i double checked and measured correctly it was not edible
excellent i made for 1st time at a birthday party and everyone gave thumbs upitsa keeper
loved the if this salad and the ingredients but there just wasn39t enough flavor for me i will try it again but next time i will add the same ingredients i use when i make cole slaw and see if that helps it needed more 34tang34
this salad is delicious added tiny cubes of ham to add a little protein soooo goooddefinately will make this recipe again a new family fav
a big hit with family amp friends love the crunchy vegetables
i have made this recipe several times each time it became a favorite of all who ate it it is now on my list of favorite salads to serve

i can not make macaroni salad or cole slaw i tried this and it is a winner i used hellman s mayonnaise instead of miracle whip and did not use water chestnuts because i don39t care for them i did not have them and it just sounded weird took it to work and everybody loved it they wouldn39t let me take the leftovers home awesome recipe thanks

i made this using only one onion the small shells and substituted mayo for the miracle whip my family loved it but i do intend on trying some of the addins that were suggested
sorry hate to write a negative review but thought this was terribly bland added a bit of horseradish celery seed more vinegar salt and pepper and more miracle whip to get it just ok
what an absolutely delicious salad i was pleasantly surprised to see that this salad is huge just the right amount of dressing for all the lovely ingredients a definite 5star recipe
i just loved this recipe i used green onions and used broccoli coleslaw in a package i also used the small shells and used 14 oz of those i know i changed it up quite a bit but everything worked so well together i did not use the water chestnuts but this dish never lacked for flavor it makes so much i take it to our church dinners and any other get togethers yummy debbie in texas

very intering combination witht he pasta and coleslaw i was weary at first if it would be good but after tasting it everyone really enjoyed it i made half the recipe still a lot of salad and i used bottled coleslaw dressing will make this again
made just as written added imitation crab wonderful
i did cut it in half it was excellent and served my 5 boys they eat a lot
this is really good and it keeps very well to make ahead of time
i served this recipe at a dinner and i had many compliments and requests for the recipe the recipe makes alot of salad and is great for potlucks
i made this dish for a birthday party yesterday and it was a big hit everyone was asking for the recipe i used a mixture of red and green pepper did not use water chestnuts and added real bacon pieces i did not use the dressing mixture i used a whole jar of marie39s coleslaw dressing which is awesome will be making this dish again
just made this today and we loved it my husband is originally from nd so i knew it had to be good
this recipe was a real hit when i made for my family it has become a favourite at potlucks as well
i have not made this yet but on my menu for 4th of july miracle whip sells everywhere and is made by kraft
this recipe always gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe it39s a new summer favorite for our family
so yummy cool and refreshing it gave me my pasta salad fix without having too many carbs
i haven39t used this recipe yet but will soon it sounds exceptionally delicious ampwill go great with the good ole39 fried chicken recipeknow my husband amp i will love it as it all sounds so easy to prepare then there will be left overs for us to eat next evening
i made this salad yesterday and everyone really loved it even my picky husband we were surprised that the combination of pasta and coleslaw was so tastey
made this for a family swim party and was a huge hit so easy to make and economicaltoo
very good and makes a lot love it with any kind of bbq
family favorite and favorite request from coworkers for pot lucks quick and easy to make yet brings raves
i have made this coleslaw many times and even won our salad contest at work with this recipe its a keeper
i made it and loved it you can put whatever ingredients you like in coleslaw i like pineapple and whatever ingredients u like in macaroni salad i like raw veggies pickles etc turns out awesome try it
i reduced this recipe down to 4 i used 12 cup macaroni 1 34 coleslaw mix 12 sweet onion 1 celery rib12 cucumber 14 green pepper 12 can water chestnuts 34 cup luite salad dressing 18 cup sugar 18 cup cider vinegar it was very good
we used this recipe for an afterthewedding lunch for family it was wonderful
i used best foods light mayo and the entire family loved it
i used miracle whip for the salad dressing and it was great this is my new favorite summertime salad
this has been a family favorite for probably 20 years i don39t really change anything the only adjustment i made is that i now use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and i use skim milk instead of whole milk just because it is what we drink it makes a thinner soup which is fine but the original recipe is probably better but still great flavor either way i also quit measuring everything i just add as much or as little of everything that i want always good it39s hard to screw up
with all of the toh soup recipes lately i cannot believe they haven39t included this one it is absolutely fantastic i have been making it since i first saw it in the toh magazine years ago i do use much finer chopped onions practically minced and smaller pieces of ham but i don39t change anything as far as ingredients you can use canned potatoes and carrots if you are crunched for time but how disappointing that the editors have not included this recipe in the all of the soup recipes with two posts about the 3480 best soups34 how could this one not make it maybe i missed it anyway this recipe if a keeper yum
i wish i could save these changes without a review because i really dislike when people change a recipe and still review it since toh doesn39t have the option to make notes here goes i made this heart healthy by deleting the bacon and sautéing the onion and carrot in olive oil after that i added chicken that i had baked separately and used 2 milk and 2 reduced fat cheese i followed all of the other directions my family loved it
how could you go wrong with ham and bacon sounds good to me i added two sticks of chopped celery grated my carrots and used red potatoes i had one cup of heavy cream i wanted to use up so i made the difference with the whole milk i also had pieces of frozen bacon ready to add it was like a stew thick and good and we liked it that way yummy
lovely but i substituted ham with chicken
good soup for fall and winter served with biscuits or cornbread great way to use up holiday ham
this is always a hit in our house the kids and i made one summer evening a while back and we now make it about every month or so we add a freshly cracked black pepper and sometimes throw in some celery even add croutons when serving great hearty dish
i too used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and bouillon as this would be my preference i had a problem getting my diced potatoes to consistently soften up so the next time i make it i will be sure to cook them in a separate pan and add them in at the last minute with the cheese and ham this was a good use of some leftover ham steak and i also had two leftover ears of sweet corn i used rather than the canned corn i could have used an extra ear my only other substitution was to use two 4 oz blocks of velveeta cheese cubed up as i did not have shredded cheese on hand and this melts in better anyway it is tasty and no celery that my husband would prefer i not use
excellent and easy chock full of flavor and texture i used half the bacon and it was great i did add some diced celery
this soup is delish rich and thick i often will substitute half and half or heavy cream for part of the milk it39s a very forgiving soup for substitutions bbutleri have frozen it without any problem
this soup was great my family loved it
yep everyone was right this was delicious and absolutely worth making i am sure i will be making this again whenever i have leftover ham
make this soup it is absolutely delicious my husband not a fan of soup even asked if i could make it regularly the flavors and texture were perfect i normally never use bouillon but did in this recipe and it was fine this is a real winner
this recipe was absolutely amazing i am going to have to double it next time because my husband and two sons almost leave me any so flavorful and satisfying i used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water definitely going into the rotation thank you
the recipe tells you to put 2 cups of ham
the best soup ever so very full of flavor and is often requested by my mother daughter amp grandson i would prepare meals for myself then take half to my 91 year old mother and she so loved this soup that she requested it at least once a month i ran out of cheese once and it is great even without the cheese i moved mother in with me when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she eventually got to the point she could no longer chew i would then blend this soup so she could just swallow and still have the nourishment now that she has passed i always think of her when i make this as this was her favorite i39m sure that once you make this soup it would be requested by your family and become your favorite too
can this chowder be frozen
i have read this recipe over and over again and no where does it tell me how much ham to use misprint maybe or advertising blocking the ingredient
great taste quick amp and easy next time i34ll use a little less cheese
anyone ever try making this into a casserole
this is a great recipe since my husband is vegetarian i used 34bacon flavored34 olive oil to saute the onion and carrots then i used veggie bullion instead of chicken and replaced the ham with sliced litelife italian sausage my entire family actually prefers the veggie version
i did id not have bacon so used butter to saute veggies added 12 cup celery because i like it this was excellent and very filling i did notice that when reheated is was much thinner but still tasty will be making again soon
this was a great hit at a big family gettogether will make it again and again
used ham instead of bacon it39s a keeper
use frozen diced hash browns to speed up prep time
my family loves this recipe it39s absolutely delicious
this was good the first day but the second day it was awesome after the flavors had time to meld a hearty delishious soup i used 12
this is a very tasty soup the ham and bacon combination really put it over the top one of our favorite potato soups i have tried
you will want more than one cup for a serving even children love this one
this was a very good soup my family really enjoyed it it was a very simple recipe to make
delicious will start adding this to our dinner rotation
i make this several times in the fall and winter served with biscuits or cornbread it makes a hearty dinner on cold evenings
i39ve been making this for a couple of years now and it is wonderful we love it
oh this is so very good keeper it has 2 kinds of pork potatoes lots of veggiescreamy cheesy sweet corny goodness in a bowl rich
my family asks for this recipe often it is easy and delicious nothing is better on a cold winter day i serve with a green salad and good homemade bread
made this last night so we can come home to it for dinner today it39s very yummy and tasty however it came out pretty thick a little thicker than we wanted what do you gals suggest i add to it to cut the thickness water or milk
loved this chowder my husband said to be sure and keep this recipe it did take longer for the potatoes to cook so prep time was quite a bit longer i did remove some of the bacon grease and it still thickened fine will definitely make again
this was really good though i did make some minor changes i used frozen thawed country style hash browns so easy since they39re already diced i added a bit more flour to make it thicker i used chicken broth in place of water i added thyme rosemary
i made this for the first time last night took a little longer than i thought but my family loved it even my picky 5 yr old will definitely make it again
used chicken stock for the water and added thyme and garlic powder to taste wow what a great chowder
this recipe was awesome my family
our son loved this soup
kids love this i make it at least twice a month regardless of what time of year it is the only thing i do different is add more flour oh and minus the carrots because gross because the kids like it a bit thicker so delicious it39s one of my go to recipes made it so many times i don39t even need the recipe anymore you won39t be disappointed
delicious chowder that i will definitely prepare for my family again next fallwinter the only thing i did differently was add fresh garlic
awesome chowder super easy to make and delicious
made this soup for the first time and it won39t be the last it is truly great tasting
not that this recipe needs another 5 star review but this truly is a delicious chowder i avoid chowders because they39re usually way too thick and heavy this was neither just a perfect balance i used 2 milk and reduced sodium chicken broth for the liquids and i added celery and thyme as suggested by other reviewers i will make this again
i added celery 12 oz of frozen corn instead of canned corn i added thyme lemon sea salt
this recipe made me want to sign up after trying multiple others over the past few monthsif you haven39t made it yet make itthe author is a culinary genious i love iti removed the carrots and onions and added some garlic powder as well as some extra ham but this recipe is fantastic however you like it it39s open to customization but if you like the vegetables there39s no way you can go wrong here if you like garlic i would definitely recommend adding a light amount of it don39t overdo it the flavors in this dish shouldn39t be overthrown by the garlic
i had never made a soup like this very good will make it again
my kids and their friends now call this halloween soup because i make it every halloween as adults my kids still come over in october and request this soup i always have to make a double batch with extra bacon so satisfying
this was amazing i love my soups a little on the thick side and this one fit the bill the flavors were perfect did not change a thing thanks for the recipe
absolutely delicious wouldn39t change a thing
very good easy to make especially with leftover easter ham not low calorie by any means
wonderful chowder although don39t use packaged shredded cheese it curdles still tastes fab but doesn39t present as well a definite keeper
i really liked jim and austin soso ashley big no
simply delicious it only needs a couple tb of bacon grease also you should add a dash or 2 of sageor thyme and a dash of garlic powder these additions make it perfect
made this for dinner tonight and it39s very good i didn39t have bacon so i added some extra ham i will definitely make this again
fantastic i included several minced garlic cloves along with the carrots amp onion and sauteed in chicken broth as i used precooked bacon also used half evaporated milk and half 1 milk lastly i used ham soup baseseasoning as alternative to the chicken bouillonsome may find it somewhat thickhearty very easy to thin with chicken broth
fantastic even my 12 year old twins who are not soup people proclaimed this the best soup they39ve ever had
omg what a delicious soup my husband wanted a soup the other day and a knew i printed this and i39ve been trying to make for a while it turned out to be so hearty thick sweet tasty soup the yums and mmhh were as loud as the clinking spoons on every bowl i used beef bouillon instead of chickenout of stock lol the potatoes carrots and corn are perfect match the bacon turns out to be almost difficult to notice but you can still taste it perfecta
this was great and the whole family enjoyed the pickiest grandson asked for seconds a first for him thanks so much will make again soon
outstanding recipe i used smoked ham steaks used white pepper and followef a recommendation of adding thyme i also used ham stock insteak of the recommended chicken bouillon tossed two diced stalks of celery in with the onions and carrots and minced a couple cloves of garlic i also used half and half in place of the milk i39ll make this a couple times every fallwinter great flavor even though it39s thick oyster crackers work well
i thought this was a great recipe i just added a bay leaf thyme and garlic powder to add more flavor i also added more chicken granules to it i did double the recipe as well turned out great
i make something very similar to this and my crew loves it only difference is i use chicken broth instead of the bouillon and no bacon good stuff
great soup i did cut back on the amount of bacon grease i used seemed like a lot used 2 milk it was fine my finished soup was a little thick so i added a little chicken broth until it was perfect
i am so happy i found this recipe so simple quick and delicious my family loved this and asked when i could make it again the only downfall is i didn39t find this recipe sooner
great way to use up leftover ham
very good
omg i have made this soup 3 weeks in a row amp my family want it again tomorrow for sunday diner since we are all dieting i put in zucchini instead of potatoes even my little grandchildren love this
i thought it was amazing and full of flavor probably my favorite chowder recipe to make
this chowder is fantastic thick and creamy and just plain yummy i used 2 milk and it worked just fine also being a ham fanatic added a bit more ham just love this as did my husband the chef in our house
i made this tonight with leftover ham from easter my husband loved the sweetness of the corn and the saltiness of the ham i cut this recipe in half and used skim milk it turned out great goes well with homemade corn bread
we really enjoyed this recipe however it is very high in sodium will probably make it again but not on a regular basis
very good
made this today for supper and was somewhat disappointed it wasn39t as flavorful as i thought it would be i have to wonder about all the folks who thought it was delicious i would rate this recipe as not that great and somewhat below average
phenomenal
delicious
i skipped the bacon as well and used a couple glugs of olive oil to saute the vegetables the chowder turned out great lots of prep time and cook time with the layering of ingredients to the pot but it39s worth it delicious and great consistency without heavy cream
i wasn39t feeling well so i cut a lot of corners here and it still came out great and my kids liked it too i used canned everything potatoes carrots corn peas and skipped the bacon and onion and we were short on cheese so i used a half jar of cheese wiz don39t judge very tasty soup thanks for sharing this very adaptable recipe
this is so good how can anyone think it39s boring satisfying amp comfort food at it39s best every time i make it someone wants the recipe made it for a party amp handed out 4 or 5 copies i use turkey bacon from a local shop only 5 slices since there is plenty of ham i also use whatever cheese i have on hand it39s good with mexican or mont jack mixes you can use more vegs i tweak it every time i make it according to what39s in the fridge very forgiving recipe thanks
pretty good weeknight dinner recipe and easy all the kids really liked it 432 i didn39t mix the bacon in the whole pot because i figured the kids wouldn39t eat it like that so just crumbled in mine and my husbands separately good either way
my husband loves chowder i have never attempted to make it because he is so particular about it my kids and husband loved this i was just trying to find a way to use some leftover christmas ham and stumbled upon a 5 star dish for my family no easy task
i thought it was boring
that was really good i used half the cheese i39m sure you could add a few spices oe vwggies to change it up but this is definitely going into rotation for the winter
easy to make tastes ok i39d call it average
very delicious and easy a nice hearty soup
so good
supper good i like to make a recipe as written the first time i make itthe second time i made this i thought i would lighten it up it39s to goodto eat just a cup of so i used smoked ham with no bacon pet milk anwater for milk and half as much cheese added 2 cups celery andmade some creamed corn to add as well as the whole corn one tblspflour instead of 3 still very good and i think it was alot less calories iused home canned corn and never add sugar to it when i can it
make sure you use quality cheese for a good cheese flavor it was delicious
ceejay you can use chicken bouillon cubes or chicken stock or chicken broth i always use cubes with perfect results hope this helps as for the chowder i haven39t tried this exact recipe but i gave it 5 stars because i have been making something similar for many years and it is wonderful
i made this the other day and it was wonderful i substituted one cup of milk for one cup of halfandhalf it made a much richer soup i also used chicken broth instead of the granules and water i then served it with the taste of home recipe for bread machine garlic bread it was a great combination
question the stores no longer stock bouillon granules what can be used instead this soup looks and sounds wonderful
after lots of time spent dicing and chopping plus the cooking time i was very disappointed with this recipe the chowder was beautiful but it had no flavor i was expecting so much more especially with all the onions and cheese that i put into it i guess i39ll have to keep looking for a good cheesy chowder recipe
tasty amp easy to make
delicious soup a great way to get my vegetablehating husband to eat cooked carrots it39s a wonderful winter soup filling amp tasty
sorry i wasted good ingredients on this recipe
absolutely delicious whole family enjoyed it it reheats very well
best and easiest chowder recipe i39ve come across add ground beefturkey instead of ham and bam you have cheeseburger chowder love this recipe both ways kid friendly my 1 year old niece loved it used white cheddar cheezits for crackers and they give it an extra umph
good flavor my kids loved it
made this last night after seeing the recipe oh boy was this ever good with six kids still at home and it pleased each one of them two different things i did i did not add bacon didn39t have it next i used deli ham sliced into small pieces this is a keeper recipe
great use for leftover ham rich hardy soup
this is so good you will be happy you made it small changes i used four strips of turkey bacon and less cheese i can39t wait to have left overs yummers
perfect way to use leftover ham from easter because i have to be gluten free i subbed cornstarch for the flour for my taste there was too much cheese and next time i will cut it down to 2 c or less that is a personal preference this is a hearty soup and is delicious thank you to whomever submitted it
excellent soup we served it to ten and not one complaint definitely worth making again
oh my all the raves about this soup are 100 true delicious creamy and hearty love the cubed ham and crumbled crisp bacon the stock itself is flavorful and rich it39s like a loaded potato soup but with extra cheese as the base even my two young picky kiddos age 3 and 7 gobbled this up and asked for seconds will make this a normal part of our rotation thanks for posting
this is one of my favorite soupchowder recipesperfect exactly like it is written no changes needed
i made this for my daughter soninlaw and grand daughter who is 1 and they absolutely loved it its a keeper recipe for sure i changed a couple of things like i do to every recipe i didn39t have 3 cups of shredded cheddar cheesei had an 8 oz block of pepper jack i grated and some pepper velveeta slices about 8 i used i added some thinly sliced celery and 2 or 3 finely chopped garlic cloves with the onions and carrots i had some whipping cream i needed to use so i used about 2 12 cups 2 percent milk and 12 c whipping cream i used about 4 cups of potatoes because my kids love the potatoes and used about 3 cups of ham served it with some mile high homemade biscuits and they all three pigged out
great soup tasted just liked scalloped potatoes and ham i also used chicken broth instead of the water and bullion was afraid it would curdle while waiting for the potatoes to cook but it didn39t i will make again thanks
made this tonight for dinner it has been snowing all day and sounded like it was worth a try it was fantastic dinner will definitely make again super easy to make
the whole family loved this great for those cold winter days
this recipe was easy and delicious we made it last night for dinner definite keeper to make again on a chilly winter night i was slightly confused on the cheese because 3 cups would be 24 ounces but the recipe says 12 ouncesi used 2 8oz bags and it was fine i39m not sure in our house there is such a thing as too much cheese
couldn39t find my potato soup recipe so i decided to give this a try because it looked pretty close i will no longer be looking for the other recipe because this one was even better plus it calls for cheddar which beats all the velveeta in the old recipe
we loved the flavor and the consistency it was really easy to make
great for lunch on a very cold day
omg this is so good full of flavorthis is such a keeper my kids will love this when they come home in the winter months
loved this soup a meal in itself
i made this recipe and really enjoyed it
this was really delicious i did make some very subtle changes instead of water and bullion i used chicken broth and increased it from 15 cups to 4 cups i found it just too thick at the provided ratios i didn39t have corn on hand so i upped the carrots and potatoes and also threw in a bit of diced celery and also added a bay leaf during the saut and no cheddar on hand so i used gouda i think any cheese or mix of cheeses would be wonderfulthis is true comfort food and i think a great 34base recipe34 for any number of variations
outstanding chowder i made this for the first time following the recipe exact however i did omit the cheddar cheese i felt this was rich enough without it and still found this to be fabulous
this recipe scared me at first however i am a big fan of consistent five star reviews so i tried it then i saw the residual grease from the bacon and i was worried i39d find a grease puddle at the top of the soup bowl i stuck with the recipe not changing a thing since it was the first time trying itit was yummy hearty rich flavorful not dietary but it was after christmas and i used leftover ham very good
almost like a dip it is so rich little goes a long way
this was the best chowder i39ve ever had nothing is more comforting or says home cooked like this hearty meal if you are looking for a chowder recipe do yourself a favour and look no further make this chowder right now i i only wish i had had a biscuit to top it off
my whole family loves this chowder it39s definitely comfort food at our house in winter love the idea of adding different veggies will try that next time
i am not a big fan of ham chowders but my husband loved this i39ll keep it in my recipe box for him
this recipe is not only delicious but also versatile follow the basics but you can vary the veggies tonight i added diced zucchini i cut back a bit on the bacon amp cheese but it39s still great what a wonderful recipe for a chilly night
this is by far one of my favorite meals from taste of home this is how i got hooked when a meal says 5 stars they aren39t lying they truly are 5 stars delicious meal wouldn39t change a thing use cabot seriously sharp cheddar cheese
made this soup tonight following the recipe very closely and it was delicious i39ll definitely will make this again only change i made was to use 2 cups chicken broth instead of 1 12 cup water plus bouillon i don39t keep bouillon in the house
this is fantastic i added some broccoli for a little more veggies it39s very filling and it reheats well
this was good i halved the recipe carefully staying within the correct amount of ingredients there was not enough liquid in proportion to ham and veggies this soup was tremendously filling must be the cheese
this is the recipe that officially got me into my motherinlaw39s good graces so so good
made this tonight and i will make it again yummy
this was outstanding will make again i served it with corn bread which made it the perfect meal on a rainy fall day
definately a 5 star but still needs a little something i will try next time with some celery perhaps family did like it
my boyfriend and i made this tonight for the first time and i39d have to say its the best chowder i39ve ever had
thank you all for the comments and reviews about my soup recipe it is still a family favorite at my house now that the weather is turning cooler i can39t wait to make it again for supper
delicious my first time cooking soup from 34scratch34 made me look like a pro i changed a few thingsadded 1 12 c of half and half increased flour to 4 tbsp left bacon and ham in for the simmering stage and increased the quantity of ham to 3 cups topped with additional sprinkle of cheese amazing thank you for this wonderful recipe it will be a favorite in this family forever
wow this is the best chowder recipe i have ever cooked i tasted it before i had added the cheese and it was great even with out it i followed the recipe exactly i had the chowder on low while we ate it and it did curdle up a bit with the 3 cup of cheese it was great but will try 1 12 cups of cheese the next time i cook this thank you for a great recipe
this chowder was rich thick and hearty and awesome flavor stick to your ribs meal in itself
i thought this soup turned out great i didn39t like the idea of thickening before the potatoes were added so i mixed the flour with the shredded cheese and added it then also added more milk based on other reviews that said soup was too thick result was great soup and it reheats really well the next day too
i would definitely make this again i thought it came out a little thick and my boyfriend wanted more bacon but those were the only complaints
absolutely delish wonderful cheesy ham flavor creamy and soothing to the palate a sure keeper that i will make consistently
i didn39t change a thing and it was delicious perfect for fall and winter
absolutely delicious and so hearty and comforting on one of these first really cold days of late fall i added more corn and potatoes than it called for and it got a big thumbs up from my husband who is a big guy and loves ribsticking comfort food
made this the other night and the family loved it my husband and 2 sons worked outside all day freezing out that day so they were happy to come home to hot chowder i did shred my own cheese like some recommended made homemade dinner rolls to go with it the only thing i will change next timeis to make a double batch thanks jennifer for a great recipe
this is fantastic and simple to put together it is in my menu planner so i can access it whenever the mood strikes
the very best chowder ever friends loved it too and we all will be making it many times nice big batch for company didn39t change a thing
this chowder was delicious as do most of the taste of home subscribers i made a couple of changes we can39t seem to resist doing that can we i used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and chicken bouillon granuals to reduce the sodium content and i didn39t have cheddar so i used a combination of colby jack and a couple slices of 2 velveeta because that was what i had on hand i also used less bacon to reduce the fat content still an excellent chowder
i have made this many times now and i am pretty happy with the recipe one thing i did differently was cooking the cubed potatoes in the microwave with some water for a few minutes before adding them as directed i also have not added three cups of cheese probably just one cup or less also one time i used creamed corn in place of whole kernel corn for a thicker soup and most of the time i do not bother with the bacon but use 14 c of butter to saute the onions
i didn39t like the the fact that it was thickened first i do that at the end soup was too hot trying to get the spuds done and when i added the cheese it broke looked yucky and no one ate the leftovers garbage can is happy i guess
very good chowder i used cheddar cheese soup with 1 cup of cheddar cheese instead of the 3 cups of cheddar cheese i also used canned potatoes and canned carrots my husband loved it so much that he wants me to make it again
i made this exactly as the recipe reads it is good but rich and a little heavy it was good as leftovers not sure i will make this very often but will keep just in case need some comfort food on a cold day
i wouldn39t drain the corn down the sink but into measuring cup then add water to make the 1 12 cups of water required use this juice for extra flavor this is one of the best chowders i have ever made thank you
this recipe makes the easiest and thickest chowder i could ever have hoped for i will make this again and again i eliminated the bacon and ham used a little olive oil instead and it was awesome chopping the veggies fine in a food processor helped too thanks for sharing this versatile recipe
too bad there are only 5 stars i made this for my son and i on monday we each ate two bowls and he took the rest home i made it again wednesday for another family and didn39t get back home before my cellphone was ringing with their praises i did take some hints from other reviewers by using precooked bacon and some bacon grease saved in my fridge i had frozen some homemade chicken stock which i always save when i am making enchiladas or casseroles with cooked chicken and milk in place of water and bouillon and as i only had 2 cups cheddar when i made it the first time i added a cup of colbyjack i had on hand it was so good i decided to use the same combo again the first time i used a whole drained can of niblets and the second time a heaping cup of frozen corn thawed both worked great i did finely chop a rib of celery to saute with the onion and carrot both times i am delighted to have a new soup recipe that is so good i can39t wait to make it again
very yummy recipe i did need to add more liquid 1 cup chicken broth and almost 2 cups milk i also added the cheese after thickening the sauce and before adding the potatoes it worked really well and was nice and smooth
appears some are using inexpensive cheese no such thing use the real thing no problems the bacon is good but unnecessary as the ham has the wonderful smoky flavor i used olive oil in place of bacon drippings very good chowder and complete meal in a bowl
great hubby can39t eat white potatoes so i substituted sweet potato cubes really good with the ham a keeper recipe
this is for toothfairylin the answer to your question is are you using cheese that is already shredded i found this out the hard way when i was trying a recipe that needed shredded cheese if you buy the cheese already cut up or shredded they add flour to it so it doesn39t stick together also you don34t really know how long that bag of sheese has been in the store so freshness does matter it is best to buy the cheese by the block and shred it yourself since i have been doing that all my recipes that call for cheese have come out perfectly i got this tip from paula dean it was a question she answered from her cooking magazine i hope this helped you
easy to make amp a way to use left over corn from a previous meal i added some celery which gave it some green vegetables without changing the taste
toothfairylin try adding the cheese to the white sauce created with the milk flour etc instead of at the end i have a similar recipe and it works great
hello fellow cooks we love this recipehave been making it since 2003 i do have a question i hope someone can help me with the first time i made this it turned out perfectly i have made this many times since but ever since then when i add the cheese at the end it all curdles and separates i have tried adding it when the soup is hot and when it has cooled somewhat still the same result it is still delicious but looks unappetizing i tell my kidsnow grownjust eat it with your eyes closed lol what am i doing wrong after cooking for 50 years it is rather frustrating any suggestions would be so appreciated happy cooking
hello fellow cooks we love this recipehave been making it since 2003 i do have a question the first time i made this it was perfect ever since after i add the cheddar cheese at the end it all separates and curdles i have added it when the soup is hot and when it has cooled still the same problem what am i doing wrong it tastes just as delicious as the first time when it turned out perfectly but looks very unappetizing i tell my kidsjust eat it with your eyes closed lolany suggestions would be so appreciated after cooking for 50 years this is frustrating thank you
this is one of my favorite soups i just made it this week it was wonderful
it is wonderful i was wondering if anyone has tried freezing it
my family loves this chowder i added some extra cheese
great
this is the second recipe i tried for a ham and potato soup and my family loved this one i cooked it in the crockpot though added all the ingredients at once i didn39t have bacon on hand so skipped it and my family still loved it so next i will add bacon to see the difference
i39ve been making this for years and it39s one of our favorite dishes over the years i have played with it now i add vermouth to the roux and different spices that we like i use turkey bacon which works fine with the addition of a little olive oil
this is my favorite soup recipe now it is delicious
it was outstanding i left out the onions and carrots but it was still amazing
the recipe is awesome i cut it in half and used fresh corn on the cob that i had cut off rather than the can corn i also added white pepper which goes well with soup and potato recipes this is a recipe that i39ll share with a lot of people
sooo good love it i added less cheese because it was already reach i used velveeta cheese to get this thickness and flavor before now i know what i can use instead of velveeta
i39ve made this soup many times since it was first published and everybody loves it i usually use precooked bacon i find there is enough grease left to saute the onions and carrots in
my husband love it
this is my family39s favorite winter soup they love it
great recipe didn39t change a thing recipe claims it serves 10 but my family of 4 made the whole thing disappear will make again
love love love this recipe it is just so warm and comforting everyone loves it
my children loved this recipe
great tasting followed directions exactly and will definitely be making again
i absolutely love this recipe it wasn39t too timedemanding and well worth the effort i honestly can39t wait to make it again
adding this to our list of favourite family meals i made the chowder ahead of dinner time and wasn39t able to hold off eating it sooooo unbelievably tasty thanks for the share
this is fabulous i used skim milk and otherwise made as directed
my whole family loves this chowder i make it every time we have leftover ham it is well worth the effort
this recipe is fabulous as written but still not simple enough for my teenagers to prepare without complaints when it is their turn to cook we usually use three cans of cubed potatoes and skip the fresh ones we usually use matchstick carrots so we don39t have to chop if we use bacon we use real bacon pieces such as hormel like you can find in the salad section of the store we usually saute the carrot and onion in olive oil since i don39t have bacon grease to use because i use canned potatoes i only heat it through before i add the ham and cheese the whole family loves this recipe and it is not unusual to make a double recipe so that we can enjoy it as leftovers
i make this a few times a year and love it i usually omit the corn and instead of bouillon i always use 2 cups of milk and 2 12 cups of chicken broth so delicious
been making this chowder for yearsit is the best
very good as is i have used chicken broth instead of bouillon you can add in any little dabs of leftover veggies to use them up and it is still good
this is a wonderful recipe our family always enjoys it and i make it for company as well it always gets good reviews
this was really good i chopped the carrots onions and ham ahead of time in the day so at dinner time i just had to throw it all together i used frozen corn and thawed it first
this is my family39s absolute favorite i got the recipe from a friend who changed it up a bit we use beef granules instead of chicken sharp cheddar cheese and add a can of creamed corn to the recipedelicious perfect for cold winter nights
this is absolutely the best soup ever a great fall recipe filling and delicious my whole family loves it too
i make this chowder every fall it is a family favorite
i made this for dinner amp it was yummy the whole family loved it especially my 2 year old i used bacon grease that i already had to saute the onions amp carrots but i had run out of bacon so i didn39t have any in the soup i also didn39t have cheddar cheese so i used colby cheese and i had to use 2 bouillon cubes instead of the granules
this was delicious really liked the crust on the bottom it was a little sweet so definitely needed the ice cream i will definitely make again
pi baked it for the first time it is very easy and delicious made few changes 1 substitute brown sugar with jaggery 2 could not get oats so substituted with crushed oats cookies 3 instead of water and sugar used canned apple juice the recipe came out perfect so easy and so delicious p
my family has been making this recipe for probably 15 years but in the version i have all the ingredients for the sauce are halved water sugar cornstarch what is making this version of the recipe way too sweet
i make a version of this with 12 cup each raisins and chopped walnuts found that it works best with juicy apples otherwise too dry i think i used 4 red delicious apples last time oh and 2 tsp of cinnamon helps to cut back on the sweetness it is a rich dessert but yummy
just made this and it is super good we had to add ice cream which just added to it it doesn39t have the soggy as some recipes will keep this recipe and make again
my husbands favorite dessert make this at least once every year so easy to make sometimes will skip the ice cream and drizzle caramel sauce on top this will make it extra sweet it39s a keeper
i cut back a bit on both sugars as other reviewers suggested i added chopped pecans and cinnamon to the crumb topping and it was delicious next time i39ll add additional apples too
to reduce our sugar intake i reduced both sugars by 13 and it turned out fantastic i will definitely be making this again
replying to david957 please don39t chastise shaar we all have our preferences and i look for warnings about recipes that are too sweet because i don39t like too much sweetness either if you39ll notice many readers here have commented about this recipe being too sweet if you like it that sweet that39s okay too
this is delicious right out of the oven add a scoop of caramel delight ice cream and wow
this was good but too sweet i will cut down on the sugar in the syrup also i baked an extra 15 min and the fuji apples were still a little hard
perfect apple crisp this recipe is easy to make and it turns out amazing every time great fall dessert and even better served with vanilla ice cream
it really was not as good as i was hoping it would be turned out okay but not the best
this was a quick and delicious dessert my family loved it we have a lot of guests in the fall and adding this dessert to my menu to serve
im not really a big fan of apple pie or apple crisp but since one of my favorite desserts i made it for him and i decided to try some of it myself with a little vanilla ice cream on the side it was delicious my whole family loved iti will definitely make it again
so bad the corn starch makes it extremely gluey and gross and is completely unnecessary all you need is the butter chopped into the flour to make the crisp topping work this tastes like something from denny39s that39s not a compliment
was excellent wouldn39t change a thing
i chose this one of many i found because of its rating however it was just barely okayi reduced the sugar in the syrup by a half there39s enough sugar in the crumb mixture and the apples and it was still a bit too sweet the topping was heavy in both texture and taste perhaps too much oatmeal i noticed more dessert left on the plates of family members who usually clean them down to the porcelain i39ll look for another recipe
i39ve never really baked anything and when i made this my family told me that this was the best apple crisp they39ve ever had this dessert is so savory and when it comes out of the oven its delicious
the recipe was good and i loved it
this crisp is very good like others i used half of the sugars and it was still very good
it turned out great but i did cut the sugar in half for both the filling and crumble part i also put in a little salt
the crumb topping is good but the sugar part with the apples is way to sweet
i tried the receipt because is was an award winner and it was my first time making apple crisp however i have tried a coworkers apple crisp and it was one of the best i will make this receipe again because it was easy to follow instructions the con overpowered with sugar4
didn39t turn out well
yummy wait to prepare this dish of apple dessert thanks for submitting it
a good easy to make recipe based on other reviews i only used a third of the white sugar and 34 of the brown sugar came out great the right amount of sweetness make it again
too sweet care for all the oatmeal either
this is the best apple recipe ever there39s no need to make an apple pie with crust after making this gem it is extremely simple and the taste is phenomenal if you love apple pie a la mode this is the recipe for you i get requests for it over and over again the only change i make is adding an extra apple or so until the apples are piled high in the pan i also split the apple varieties and use honeycrisp and granny smith i use a little more granny smith than honeycrisp usually about 34 honey crisps to 45 granny smiths dependent on apple size
folks who found this too sweet did you cut the white or the brown sugar or both
only thing i done different was put the sliced apples in a bowl sprinkled with cinnamon and mixed it up good before placing the apples in the baking dish and i also used pure almond flavoring in place of the vanilla while still warm top with scoop of ice cream and drizzle caramel topping over the top delicious
wow this is wonderful family all loved it i cut sugar by 14 added an extra cup of apples and sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking i baked it as the recipe said for 65 minutes and it was perfect thank you
way too sweet the crisp topping was nice there was a nice balance of oats to sugar and butter and flour the apple mixture was horribly sweet i love sweet but after a few bites i had enough my son and husband who usually pick away at the rest of the pan finished theirs but that was it i was ready to throw the rest away when i decided to use it as a topping for steel cut oats this morning with a ratio of two parts oat to apple topping it was perfect with unsweetened coffee next time i would cut the sugar in half it is also a nice mixin with greek yogurt but as a dessert a big disappointment for such great reviews
i really don39t like any apple desserts after trying a friend39s apple crisp i thought i39d try to make my own i39m so glad i found this recipe yes it39s sweet it is dessert after all a little bit is just enough perfect for gatherings thank you
this is definitely the best apple crisp i39ve ever had i have been making this recipe since 2013
i tried this recipe with vegan butter to see if it would work as a dessert option for a vegan relative at thanksgiving and it came out beautifully you tell it regular butter will also try this with pears and peaches
this was my first time making apple crisp and i thought it was very good after reading the reviews with some saying it was too sweet i only used 12 cup of granulated sugar and it came out perfect i would use this recipe again
this recipe was not to my liking i found it to be overly sweet and i did not care for the crisp part it was not crispy enough
i made this with some apples a friend gave me and it did not disappoint it had lots of cinnamon flavor and crumbly crust which are my favorite parts the extra liquid you prepare to add to the apples did make it a little on the sweet side but i loved the addition of vanilla
it was okay a lot of oatmeal flavor and not enough cinnamon i like my recipe for apple betty much better
it was easy and delicious but too sweet for me how could i make it less sweet i think it was the syrup
i make this every fallwith honeycrisp applesamazing
i am not a dessert fan but made this for my husband who is i cut the recipe in half which was very wise of mehe almost ate it all hence the 5 stars
i am not a dessert fan but made this for my husband who is i cut the recipe in half which was very wise of mehe almost ate it all hence the 5 stars
hello can this recipe be done in a microwave as well as i wish to try it out by this weekend thanks
too sweet prefer a more traditional apple crisp with a simple crumb topping made it for a second time tonight and confirmed the sweetness and twice the baking time is a good reason to skip it however if you are feeding people with a serious sweet tooth this is great for you
made it as written and used granny smith apples just the right amount of topping and a good amount of apple filling will make it again
absolutely delicous it was a hit with everyone i made it as the the recipe stated and it was great we liked the chewy crispy topping but would have liked more of it i will double that part when i make it again
delicious i sprinkled extra cinnamon and sugar over the apples before adding the crumb topping
easy to make and family loved it delish
delicious i used granny smith apples and doubled the recipe made for group of 16 and everyone loved it put topping in bottom as suggested did not countmeasure apples just kept piling them up till they filled my pyrex dish 9 x 13 and put remainder of topping as best i could on top before pouring liquid over put pan or foil under dish since it will probably bubble over in oven served with vanilla ice cream but excellent without
i tried this using less sugar and more apples different than any recipe i39ve used in the pastturned out fabulous this is the only way i will ever make it from now on i39m sure other types of fruit would be good also thanks so much 1039s here
my husband is not a big dessert person 2 things he will only eat chocolate cake and apple pie so i made this and a asked him to please just try this he did he loved it and took a big bowl of it he said i can make this now in place of his apple pie
just made this today it is excellent i followed recipe as is and next time i will cut both the brown sugar and white in half it is sweet as apple crisp is but it wouldn39t hurt cutting back a bit taste just like from a restaurant
i agree too much sugar the second time i made it i used 12 cup of both sugars i will use 14 cup the next time i make it delicious hot with vanilla ice cream
this was really good but also very sweet we really enjoyed it but like other reviews i will cut back on the sugar next time i will be making it again
per the reviews i cut my sugar to 14c brown and 14c white and it was plenty sweet for us i couldnt even fathom 2c of sugar otherwise it would be a 5 star
this is a delicious crisp recipe albeit rather sweet for our taste the first time i made it i followed the recipe as directed i now make it with half the sugar i do squeeze fresh lemon over the apples to balance the acidity and sweetness next time i plan on trying apple cider in place of the water and further cutting the sugar to14 c for even more apple flavor my husband craves this apple crisp as soon as the cooler fall weather arrives
easy and delicious i used honey crisp apples and will try other apples next time there will definitely be a next timeexcellent in my book
definitely a winning recipe at my house this is the best apple crisp i39ve ever eaten
i have to say i was a little concerned because of all the flour and corn starch but it was absolutely delicious
i really loved this recipe we acquired some apples from my son39s tree which we believe to be a golden delicious therefore i did cut the sugar for the filling back to 12 cup and used 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar in the cup of water to tang it up of course i had to eat my first serving before it had cooled completely with melting vanilla ice cream on top so delish and i know it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors blend together i will make it with granny smith apples and try apple cider instead of water next time and i believe it39ll be perfect for my family39s taste thanks so much for sharing gertrude
this is one of the best apple crisp recipes i have tried i did cut back the sugars by half and will cut back more next time i make it as i still found it sweet i did add some nutmeg and will add more cinnamon next time
love this it39s my goto apple crisp recipe i do also cut down on the sugars and go heavy on the apples and it is delicious love the way the crusttopping gets a little chewycrispy sometimes i double the recipe in a 13x9 for company
very very sweet even with cutting the sugars in half
i thought it was amazing and will definitely make it again i cut the whole recipe in half because i made it for just two people i will probably cut back on some of the sugar also
this was an awesome apple crisp followed suggestions and cut both sugars in half loved the bottom crust
even though i gave this recipe 5 stars i think there is way too much sweetness with 2 cups of sugars fantastic recipe and this is definitely a keeper i will just decrease the amount of both white and brown sugar the next time
everyone enjoyed this apple crisp i diced the apple smaller then normal going to add peaches next time
i would recommend cooking it an additional 2025 minutes i really liked my apples soft like apple pie and the topping more caramelized it was fantastic
i liked this recipe but i thought there was way too much sugar involved i cut both the brown amp the white sugars in half and the final result was exceptionally delicious i made real whipped cream to which i added some cinnamon while whipping it yummy
excellent thanks for sharing my girlfriend liked it and she39s pretty finicky great big ole spoon of coolwhip was the only improvement here thanks again
i haven39t tried this recipe but really want to find one similar to what i made as a teenager without oats if carolanne1210 could share her 34tried an true34 i would like to see if hers is made without oats
amazingi have made this recipe for yearsrave reviews wherever i take iti use honeycrisp apples in mine thanks for sharing
this recipe is fantastic
sounded interesting so i gave it a try this was much too sweet and the bottom was hard i39ll stick with my old triedandtrue
i thought this recipe was too sweet also and a little dry i cut down on the white sugar only used a 3rd cup and i added a few more apples to add a little more liquid
it was way too sweet i could taste the brown sugar may try again but will cut down on both the white and brown sugars
this was good except it was hard getting the bottom crust out when cutting and serving the next time i make this i will cut the topping in half and only put in on the top of the apples i will also cut down on the sugars as someone else did
aside from being way too sweet i thought it was good will make again and just cut down on the oatmeal and brown sugar
we really liked this recipe the first time i followed it exactly and it turned out great recently i had some pears that i needed to do something with so i pulled this recipe out again this time i used a 9 x 13 dish didn39t use any of the crumbles for a crust all crumbles went on top and used 8 to 10 pears the results were just as good and probably saved a few calories
very good recipe followed it exactly and came out great
way to sweet for me the cornstarch and sugar overpowered the apples
this was easy to fix took this to our friends39 house for dinner came home with an empty dish
good recipe
this is great
it was good but the cornstarch mixture was too sweet and overpowered the fruit and crisp even after reducing it if you have a major sweet tooth this is a great recipe but if you prefer your apple to be more prominent i39d suggest to go light on the sugar cornstarch mixture
i did not care for this recipe i thought that the filling was too gelatinous and sweet
great recipe and everyone that has had it has loved it
this recipe was way too sweet for my taste i used a granny smith a johnathon amp a mcintosh apple
i followed the recipe i thought the oats were a little crunchy should i have used quick cooking oats my husband loved it any way
great recipe to use with my own home grown apples awesome
outstanding
my family loved it i took the advice of another reviewer amp cut the sugar in half amp added an additional 2 cups of apples the sweetness level was just right for us amp the amount of apples was perfect i used cortland apples from a local orchard i39d never made an apple crisp with a liquid poured over it amp was skeptical but it was delicious this will be the apple crisp recipe i make from now on thanks for sharing it with us
sooo good had 4 cups of apples already sliced and poured apple pie sauce left over from canning apple pie filling over them except added vanilla making crisp was so quick and it turned out just right
this was yummy and very easy i will definitely make this again my husband just loved it too
very good probably the best crisp we have had it was even better when i added chopped almonds to the top layer of the crumbly stuff next time i39ll use 2 more cups of apples and 12 cup white sugar in the syrup instead of 1 cup it was on the cusp of being too sweet we didn39t have ice or whipped cream so this rating is just the crisp
the best apple crisp ever
i tried the recipe an it is the best i have ever tasted it is so nice and crunchy
fantastic it was even better cold the next morning i doubled the recipe for five people and used a 13x9 pan it didn39t even last 24 hours
i am huge fan of apple crisp and this one hits the spot
i have made my apple crisp this way for years it39s been in our family since i can remember
this sounds great
like stoltzmj said i have used this same recipe for years and years with rhubarb only difference is i don39t put anything in the bottom of the pan and put all the crisp on top also fold the apples or rhubarb in the sauce before putting in the pan so every piece is coated oops i goofed it is the apple one where i don39t put anything in the bottom of the pan but i do with the rhubarb sorry about that
this has been my goto recipe for the past 2 years for apple crisp i have been told it is better than the apple crisp at the fairs i make mine with cortland apples and i am sure to use real unsalted butter for the topping margarine doesn39t do the dish any justice i normally double the recipe and use a 13x9x2 pan thank you for such an amazing recipe
very good
sounds good
wonderful
i have used this recipe for years with rhubarb it is excellent i will try it with apples it should be good
ok
turned out very well first time making it and the whole family was pleased
only one worddelicious we took it as an extra dessert to a birthday party people were bypassing the birthday cake to get seconds the pan was almost clean when we left we had either vanilla ice cream or cool whip to put on top either one was good also we used golden delicious apples soooo good
only one worddelicious we took it as an extra dessert to a birthday party people were bypassing the birthday cake to get seconds the pan was almost clean when we left we had either vanilla ice cream or cool whip to put on top either one was good also we used golden delicious apples soooo good
i made this as recipe is and it taste39s good but i didn39t like that the bottom layer was a little soggy so next time i make this dish i may change the layers to apples on bottom amp crust on top and see if i like that better good recipe though would make again thanks
so delicious it came out with the perfect balance of crispy and gooey
absolutely delicious
very very good
excellent
this is a delicious recipe as suggested by others i decreased the brown sugar to a half cup wanting a little different twist i also added a package of ocean spray blueberry flavored craisins it turned out to be a good flavor combination with the apples will be making this again
this is such a great recipe we did make a few adjustments for the sauce to put on the apples we halved everything except the vanilla for the crustcrumb mixture we only put in 23 cup of brown sugar next time we will try 12 cup as it was still plenty sweet my husband made it and he loved how easy it was
great recipe i reduced the granulated sugar by 13 cup and it turned out great next time i will add more cinnamon to the boiled mixture
this is the best apple crisp recipe i have ever had i added cinnamon to the cornstarch mix and tossed the mix with the apples before putting onto the crust can39t wait to make this again
i have made this many times for my boys it39s one of their favorites my husband even likes it the aroma of the sauce fills the kitchen when it cooks
so very disappointed with this recipe it was terrible i made this for a special occasion and it was like eating from the sugar bowl yuk i find it hard to believe this was a 34winning34 recipe
this has become a family favorite
i39ve made this recipe for years it is always a success but about a year ago my recipe was misplaced i can39t tell you how happy i am to have it again i39ve got apples just waiting to jump in thank you so very much blue99mustang
best crisp recipe i have triedincreased amount of apples and put some cinnamon in the thickened sugar mixloved it
while this recipe was good i found it to be a little too sweet i will make it again but cut back a bit on the sugar maybe it39s because i used honeycrisp apples my guests raved about it
took this to work and my coworkers loved it i added an extra cup of apples and a teaspoon if cinnamon and a teaspoon of nutmeg to the cornstarch mixture then mixed it with the apples before putting it on the crust it was awesome
this is my new go to recipe i should have doubled it in a 9x13 pan took to a get together and had none left for me may add cinnamon to cornstarch sauce
i tripled the batch and took small pans to all my elderly friends and they all raved about this recipe
i made this for a family dinner last weekend and everyone loved it i used a bit more apple than the recipe called for and i did mix the apples with the cornstarch mixture before putting in pan the only thing i would change would be maybe a little more cinnamon put some melting ice cream on topyummy
this is the best crisp recipe we love it
my husband and i love this easytomake recipe it39s wonderful
i added a little extra butter and cinnamonusing a golden delicious apple very very good
my first time making an apple crisp for company and everybody enjoyed very easy to make as well definately will make again

my goodness what a wonderful treat for a cold winter day i tried this last night for the very first time for my small group live in florida and have a big cold snap everyone loved it got rave reviews and they fought over who got to take home the small amount left in the pan i had double the recipe for 12 people and it more than served enough i used granny smith apples so the sugar amount was just right no wonder it won a blue ribbon
this is amazing i doubled it for a houseful of company and they ate every bit so good i did add extra spice but a great recipe nonetheless
i have made this 4 times now once with apples then with cherries raspberryblackberry and blueberry and all have been excellent all but the apples were frozen fruit i used about 34 to a pound of fruit i cooked and lightly crushed the fruit in the watersugarcorn starch mixture after it had thickened and cleared
i barely got a slice my family devoured it i will double or triple it next timedelicious
my whole family loved this next time i will have to double the recipe because the entire batch was gone in a day loved the bottom crust i added a little cinnamon to the apples before i poured the sauce over them i made it twice in one weekend
oooohhhso yummy i did substitute splenda white and splenda brown sugar since my husband is diabetic it turned out greathe loved it perfect texture and oh my the taste not to mention how wonderful our house smells no wonder that it was a contest winner
this was superyum i made it glutenfree by using 12c sorghum flour amp 12c white rice flour plus 1t xantham gum and bob39s red mill gf oats i used 12 the sugar and made it in a 9x13 pan with 2x the apples granny smith i also added ginger allspice and nutmeg to the syrup mixture no one could tell it was glutenfree and it was wonderful
i am a diabetic so i used spelenda white sugar and brown sugar in the recipe worked great only thing the sauce you make with splenda does not get clear but taste is great better for us diabetic39s
didn39t try yet but will definitely try it this thanksgiving thanks for making it easier to make
very good can this be frozen i39m wondering if it will come out the same
excellent great flavor i think i did something wrong because the oatmeal pieces stayed a little chewy i used granny smith apples and they got very soft but they were delicious can someone help me out with the oatmeal problem it is a great receipe will make it again and again
my family and i loved this apple crisp it39s a keeper
my partner and i like everything including desserts in nice sized full servingsby increasing all the ingredients by 50 and using a 9x13 baking dish we were able to get 8 nice sized delicious servings
i doubled the recipe used1 cup white sugar amp 12 cup splendaalways add more cinnamonlittle salt apple pie spice also added the apples to the hot mixture to cover better was delicious vic
this has become our 34go to34 apple crisp recipe everyone who has tried it loves it thank you so much
i usually put the cinnamon in the sauce and pour it over the apples i like to serve it warm with vanilla ice cream delicious
made this tonight for dinner and wowa winner easy also will definitely make again
i just made this for the first time and it only baked for 40 minutes because then my oven caught on fire lol now i need a new one just when i was getting into a baking kick this was good but it was way to sweet next time i39m going to cut the sugar in half hopefully next time i can bake it all the way and have better results with the modified recipe
i have one questionwhat can i substitute for corn starch which i am allergic to thanks
loved it i39ve tried several apple crisp recipes and this one is the keeper
loved this recipe would definately make again
my sister39s favorite dessrt is apple crisp i wanted to impress her when she came for supper she loved it and so did the rest of the family would make again
this recipe was easy to make i made more than one pan and froze them the best apple crisp i have ever eaten and everyone raved about how good it takes definetely a keeper in my box
had to use an 8x8 pan and this still came out wonderful was a big hit
this apple crisp is delicious it has very pleasing proportions of apple to crisp i did make some changes based on other reviews because we don39t like things as sweet as this would be with the calledfor sugar i cut the brown sugar and the sugar back to a little more than 12 cup each i also used about 112 tsp of cinnamon i used 4 medium granny smith apples which amounted to a little over 4 cups in deference to my husband39s trying to watch his cholesterol i used i can39t believe it39s not butter and i love butter in baked goods i must say the product lived up to its name i will definitely make this again
we just made this tonight and it was so good i did cut back on the white and brown sugar though because my apples were already so sweet i used a little over 12 of what the recipe called for thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us
i will make this again with slight modifications i39m going to decrease the brown sugar to either only 12 or 34 cup the full 1 cup was just a bit too sweet i think i will also just about double the amount of apples we found it heavy on the crisp and light on apple very good flavor
thi was a little different from most crisps i39ve made so i was a little hesitant but it had good reviews so thought i39d go ahead and try it it was absolutely fantastic i won39t ever make another apple crisp again this is the one my husband could not stop eating it thank you for this one
i had a lot of apples left over from christmas and i didnt want to lose them so i decided to look for a good apple crisp recipe and my first thought was to go to the taste of home website and i am so glad i did this is the best crisp recipe i have ever made its tastes wonderful thank you for sharing this recipe
i made this as a sweet potato apple mix with a 4 cup mix that was slightly heavier on the apple sidei only made a half of the crust sprinkling it over just the top of the casserole it was wonder addition to our meal
amazing this recipe was so delicious the only change i think i39ll make is to add less sugar and a little more cinnamon otherwise delicious
should be called best ever apple crisp
this recipe is amazing so easy to make even with my four little kids running around my husband doesn39t usually like these types of desserts but he loved it definitely a family favorite
made this while camping this weekend with our family i doubled the recipe and came home with a small piece everyone said it was the best apple crisp they ever ate
this was very good easy to put together with ingredients on hand i popped it in the oven while our guests and ourselves ate dinner everyone thought it was great and the smell in the crisp fall air was very inviting
this is a great recipe the topping on the bottom and the homemade vanilla sauce make it extra special
there is a web site for diabectic with good reciped you can also sub for the sugar with splender
ask where you buy your apples they will be glad to hep you i like to use gala
i think it is good to know if some of the people think the recipe is too sweet as i don39t like things that way and i wouldn39t have to make the recipe once to find out the people aren39t trying to criticize the recipe but only telling how they prefer it
reapple crispthis is one of the best apple crisps that i39ve ever madei took sguy39s advice and added more apples and oatmeal and cut down on the sugar as the apples i was using were already quite sweet
i tried this apples crisp recipe and took sguy advice it is the best i39m making it again
this recipe was good but we found it too sweet and not enough apples if i made it again i would cut the sugar back some and add more oatmeal
this is the best apple crisp i have ever had bar none even cold leftovers were great will make this one again
this was the best apple crisp i have ever had i will definately be making it again and again i did omit some of the sugar because i used a sweeter apple and it turn out great
yummmmmy i used 6 large apples which was significantly more than 4 cups and put only 34 cup of granulated sugar in the saucey part
i found this recipe was much too sweet and not enough apples
re apple crispmy family really enjoyed this recipe i will make this one again pcinant
the absolutelsy best
easy to make and very yummy my family gobbled it up
really enjoyed this recipe prepared this on the stovetop which i prefer left out the celery and green peppers which i don39t care for also did not add any extra salt turned out very well
very good flavor and easy
very yummy and my new mardi gras goto dinner i did follow the recipe ingredients but i had rotisserie chicken and already cooked shrimp and sausage so i slow cooked all the veggies and seasoning in the liquids for 4 hours on low added the chicken and sausage for 20 more minutes and the shrimp for 5 more minutes voiila it was great
we can39t get enough of this flavorful meal i wasn39t sure how this was going to taste but it will be one of my top meals because of the wonderful flavors i plan on using the saucespiceveggie to make chicken cacciatore
perfect for a cold winter day we enjoyed the heartiness of it
delicious and easy my picky eaterfamily really enjoyed this
my family loved this it will be in the winter meal rotation
my husband loved this recipe it39s a keeper thanks for sharing
this recipe was very easy and the the finished result was fabulous i can see why this was a contest winner i used hot sausage because i did not have smoked it gave just the right amount of spice to the dish will definitely add this to my favorites
i made this recipe and made a couple very minor changes due to having certain ingredients on hand i used chicken broth instead of beef 1 12 pounds chicken tenders cut into bite size pieces 12 ounces of smoked beef sausage and 1 pound of 2130 shrimp everything else was as listed in recipe i must say the finished dish was excellent i would recommend this recipe to anyone and it would make a wonderful meal for guests five stars for sure
can you use regular italian sausage in this recipe if so would i cook it first and then put in slow cooker
i39ve made this a couple of times and was wonderful each time i omitted the cayenne and hot pepper sauce and instead added 12 teaspoon chile powder as my husband doesn39t like it too spicy i used 2 kinds of sausage and 2 lbs large shrimp which we love along with 2 lbs cubed chicken breasts as other husbands have said 34this is a keeper34
i have been making this for a long time we love it i believe i first got it from the comfort food diet cookbook i put everything in it but the hot sauce we don39t think we need it i have made this for several occasions and our friends love it also
i made this tonight i didn39t have any hot sauce so omitted that otherwise i followed the recipe my hubby said 34that39s a keeper34 don39t need the hot sauce for my family i39ll be making it again
i used my home grown tomatoes and andouille sausage this turned out sooooo good
to much of a green pepper taste for me my 15 year old said it was ok my hubby seemed to like it
love the flavor i didn39t have the time to cook in the slow cooker it was quick and easy in my ninja foodie using the pressure cooker feature
could i use tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes cant39s wait to try the recipe
this was fantastic the broth is so flavorful a little bit spicy for the kids but that39s easy to dial back i will definitely make this again
very good i left out the shrimp though allergies here
this was tasty but the next time i make this i will not use so much chicken and use more shrimp i39ll also cut down on the hot sauce everyone thought it was good and the 5 of us voted to do it again
just didn39t care for
we have been using this recipe since it came out in 2008 it is one of my favorite we use it every winter and i have passed this recipe around dozens of times the only thing i change is doubling the shrimp and chicken because my boys never feel like they get enough
i made this yesterday and it came out fine it was tasty and spicy but i like deddmen can39t get over it not being like jambalaya since the rice is not cooked in the sauce which is very soupy more like gumbo but without the roux which i know is what makes it gumbo next time i will cook the rice with the sauce not separately
thank you sradair for your review i just got an instant pot for christmas and am anxious to try it this recipe sounds yummy and i39m going to give it the instant pot treatment you outlined
this is my go to recipe for entertaining i start it eight hours before the dinner is served the table is set and i can visit with my guest when they arrive with a minimal amount to do before dinner is served this is a delicious dish served with coleslaw and hot rice this one pot dish is easy to clean up and gives me more time with my guests
super easy to make this is my favorite jambalaya recipe
i made this according to the recipe and it was wonderful served it for company everyone loved it
i lived in baton rouge and i can honestly say that this is pretty good deddmen you can keep your real jambalaya you don39t see me getting mad at non hispanic restaurants for making tacos
calm down deddmen you39ll get your pressure up 0 there are all kinds of tastes all types of cooks this is a good crockpot gumbolike dish works great for weeknights maybe sometime we can go down to louisiana and enjoy real jambalaya this is fine for what it is
this is not jambalaya this is some kind of sauce served over ricewith real actual cajun jambalaya the rice is cooked in with all of the other ingredients that way the flavor is in the rice not sitting on top of it i can39t believe the other reviewers liked this recipe they must have been from up north or someplace where cooking with spice is a novelty thing come down south to the jambalaya festival in gonzales louisiana one year and you39ll taste real jambalaya
tasty did not have any shrimp so i skipped out of this ingredient and dish was still tasty
my family loves it
this is the most wonderful recipe for jambalaya i39ve ever seen i followed the recipe exactly except i forgot the hot sauce i left for a short shift at work and when i came home 5 hours later the whole house smelled heavenly thank you for the deliciousness
a wonderful recipe i was short on time and made this in my instant pot served over brown rice it turned out great definitely will fix this again and sharing with foodie friends second time again in the instant pot this time i sauted the onion green pepper celery for a few minutes then added spices and garlic and cooked about a minute then added chicken and sausage stirred a bit then added all the other ingredients then cooked on the slow cooker setting for 212 hours added shrimp and cooked another half hour i love this recipe so easy
made this with some super spicy sausage so cut back on the hot sauce just a little tasted great not 34crock pot like34 at all
delicious we have to watch our sodium so i made a few changes sodium free chicken broth no salt added tomatoes 14 smoked sausage used nosodium salt cut the sodium content in half absolutely delicious
been making a similar dish for years it may not be the authentic way but it sure works for me always a winner
this recipe is one of my favorite weeknight meals it is simple but packed full of flavor and hearty i usually add about 1 tbsp cajun seasoning to it as well just to add an extra kick i recommend this recipe and have shared it multiple times definitely a keeper
wow this was great i used a spicy andouille sausage so decreased the cayenne pepper a little otherwise followed the directions exactly and it was fantastic will definitely make this again
i made this and it was awesome it was super easy to prepare had good flavor and was just spicy enough i didn39t add the chicken or shrimp i used smoked sausage and kielbasa i added more chicken stock just enough to cover it i will be repeating this recipe for years to come
my family loves this i have to double the recipe and it helps the diabetic39s blood sugar too you can chop ahead and freeze the onion celery and green peppers and use prepared minced garlic 1 clove 1 gently rounded teaspoon freezes and reheats a treat
absolutely love it
made it for a family gathering and it was a big hit
i39cve made this it is easy quick and very tasty
quick and easy basic recipe easy to adapt
this is a good basic jambalaya recipe all of the core ingredients are here however the cayenne and hot pepper just make it hot vs a balanced blend of flavors with the other herbs in order to supplement the flavor we cut back on the salt and added worcestershire made this due to the convenience of the slow cooker however time permitting i would use my old stand by southern jambalaya recipe in the future
this has to be the worst recipe ever what a waste of good food in a poorly contrived meal is there a way to get my money back for all the fresh shrimp i wasted going back to the real recipes of the south
really goodused precooked frozen shrimp
i had some experiments with that recipe but in redmond 4500 multicooker it is fantastic really i had a chance to compare rice and multicooker the last one much simpler and faster any recipe can be made by my children
yummy i omitted the shrimp to save turkey smoked sausage is a healthy substitute for regular smoked sausage theresa
i make this at least once a month we love it i leave out the shrimp and just add more chicken and sausage since my husband doesn39t like seafood couldn39t be easier just chop everything up and mix it up in the crockpot
i absolutely love this recipe perfect amount of spice and heat so great to warm you up on a cold winter day
this recipe is easy flavorful and i will definitely keep it my recipe box
my family and i love this recipe so easy and sooooooooo good
it39s great
i have never cooked jambalaya before but i think this may be the best tasting jambalaya i have ever experienced i cooked it in low heat on the stovetop used orange bell peppers and previously baked chicken i used original conecuh hickory smoked sausage an alabama favorite i will make it again
great recipe really easy to get going in the crockpot and the whole family loved it we have made this several times and will continue to do so
my husband who hates chicken loves this dish i39ve cooked it in the crockpot and stove pot and both are delicious
we both loved it i39ve made several different versions of jambalaya and this is possibly my favorite i was able to add the shrimp after about 3 12 hrs and i cut the tobasco and cayenne in half it was perfect my wife said will def fix again
this was a very easy jambalaya to make it had just the right amount of spice for me very hearty and filling
excellent we love the flavor and it39s easy to make i39ll make this often
this just did not hit me like i thought it would like others i think the cooking time was way too long and caused the meat to get dry the overall flavor just wasn39t there
i absolutely love this recipe i didn39t like the overpowering smoked sausage flavor the first time i made this personal preference so i eliminated the smoked sausage altogether the second time i made it and it still turned out incredible
this is so easy and so very good i questioned whether jambalaya made in the crock pot could have the flavor i so enjoy but i am now a believer i will be making this again i used imitation crab in place of the scrimp
my savannah georgia bred husband says it is the best he has ever had that39s a winning vote in my book
this recipe is delicious exactly as written and with or without the shrimp in spite of the long list of ingredients it is very easy and quick to get in the slow cooker and especially easy when using frozen chopped onions and green peppers i wouldn39t change a thing received family stamp of approval
overall this was good it was a bit overcooked when i checked it at 4 hours it was my first time using a slow cooker though so that could be my fault i might make it again but it gave my husband heartburn last time
great recipe i followed the recipe exactly and it didn39t need any tweaking at all i did have to turn the crockpot up to high for an hour or so though
this is a fabulous recipe i39ve made it at least a dozen times with no modifications and it is a hit every time i use frozen uncooked and deveined shrimp when fresh isn39t available yummy
my husband really liked this very spicy and flavorful
delicious will definitely make again
very good it39s a little on the spicy side and the chicken turned out slightly dry very good overall though
love this recipe great on fall camping trips
pretty good
we didn39t know we liked jambalaya 39til we tried this
solid thumbs up from the whole family decreased the hot sauce and cayenne to suit the kids39 taste and just added hot sauce at the table also replace the green pepper with zucchini and okra again just personal preferences thanks for sharing this awesome recipe
my family loves this i can39t use shell fish because of allergies but i just add more sausage we lived near cajun country and although this is not what they would call authentic it sure is good be sure to use quality andouille sausage it makes a big difference we all love hot spicy food so after the first time i added tony chachere39s as well as all the spices indicated this is on my rotation of regulars thanks cindi
oh my god we loved this recipe i omitted the hot sauce and used chili powder instead of cayenne and it was good used a whole pound of shrimp also the aroma is phenomenal will make again
authentic jambalaya or not it is fantastic i had a pound of shrimp and just threw it all in that39s what my family kept picking out
mmm i made this last weekend and i didn39t even get seconds or leftovers sure is good
this is a fabulous recipe
this recipe does not taste like it was quick and easy to make it is a wonderful tribute to real jambalaya everyone in our family loved it and was a perfect way to celebrate fat tuesday
my family loved this i made with turkey sausage and served with brown rice
i used turkey sausage and served with brown rice
so easy so goodi have never been a fan of cajun food but this is delicious
excellent recipe great flavor i cut some of the fat by using turkey cocktail links
i39ve made this several times cajun is not always easy to do from scratch but this recipe is easy and very tasty
this recipe is wonderful my husband said it39s the best crockpot recipe of any kind that i39ve ever made i made it exactly like the recipe saidexcept i was out of parsley flakes i don39t know how much of a difference it would39ve have made because it was absolutely delicious i was in a hurry so instead of cooking it on low i cooked it on high for about 2 12 hours
this recipe is wonderful my husband said it39s the best crockpot recipe of any kind that i39ve ever made i made it exactly like the recipe saidexcept i was out of parsley flakes i don39t know how much of a difference it would39ve have made because it was absolutely delicious
since miss cindi is from texas i did not expect a louisiana let alone a new orleans style jambalaya i found this forgotten texas jambalaya to be very flavorful and it certainly wont be forgotten in our homei cut this recipe in half since there are only two of us i used only ¼ tsp each of the hot pepper sauce and cayenne pepper to suit our personal tastes and i found andouille sausage at our local supermarket served it on a bed of jasmine long grain rice my daughter suggested adding 1 tsp of file powder the next time i make this thank you miss cindi
used turkey sausage and omitted the shrimp excellent
this recipe takes a lot of prep time but after you throw it in the crock pot it39s all worth it the seasonings are just right and it makes a large amount i ended up freezing half great for watching football
very tasty
wonderfully easy and flavorful
i know from watching emeril that jambalya normally uses andouille sausage but here in rural western pa we just don39t have access to it this is the third time we39ve made this recipe this time we doubled the chicken shrimp tomatoes and seasonings my family is giving the altered recipe a solid 8 out of 10
greateasy to make
tweeked the spices to fit my southern tastes wonderfulbest i39ve ever had or made
make this one all the time its one of my go to recipes wouldn39t change a thins
have made often have frozen but kept shrimp separate and only added before serving
this is a great dish for a cool night very easy and everything was flavored just right
this was soooo unbelievably good i only made a half recipe to try the first time and i didn39t have shrimp but it was so good anyways the flavor was perfect not too spicy and of course being able to throw it all in the slow cooker is such a bonus i use mine as often as i can to make life easier
this is delicious this is not a dish we come across often i live in the netherlands but i love it like other reviewers i did not change a thing it is a little spicy and has lots of flavor i can truly recommend this thank you for sharing
this was the easiest and tastiest jambalaya i39ve ever made i wouldn39t change a thing
easy to make and just spicy enough for the whole family to enjoy i will add this to my 34keepers34 list and wont change a thing
absolutely amazing great with and without the shrimp
making this again tonight i thought it was good not amazing but good my bf on the other hand really really liked it guess it depends on what kind of taste you have
this is so flavorful and yummy i love that it has a bit of spice and great texture i didn39t need to change anything including the cook time which is amazing in itself i make this frequently
wonderful dish full of flavor try with confidence
i made this as our afterchurch meal for christmas eve everyone really liked it it was great to be able to put it all together earlier in the day and then just add the shrimp and make the rice when i got home i39ll definitely make this again
this was an amazing crock pot recipe i added 1 lb of shrimp and a lb of cut up tilapia the fish was my favorite i think i will try chicken thighs instead of breast next time though definitely a keeper
super easy and tasted great
this gets 5 stars for the ease of preparation and taste i used less heat but that is a personal preference just dump it in and you39re done
this has become a staple in our house i39ve made it with chirzo sausage so good and gives that extra spice
yummy everyone in out house loved it we like things a little spicier so we put in extra hot sauce and cayenne pepper
great flavor and very easy to make it is definitely a 34keeper34 we have made it several times already
my husband loves jambalaya so i decided to give this recipe a tryit was extremely easy and both of us loved ithe said it39s a keeperi did leave out the celery because neither of us are fans
my family really enjoys this recipe it39s smoky spicy and flavorful good cajun flavor with milder heat i39ve used the recipe several times now and they always ask for more
i39ve made this for about 5 years now and it39s become a winter staple such a easy recipe and all of my family love it thanks for a great recipe
this recipe was so easy and delicious i substituted smoked turkey sausage for the regular sausage
we made this last night and no leftovers for today this is delicious and so flavorful made it like the recipe says with only these substitutionshad boneless skinless thighs instead of the breasts and used a precooked package of shrimp the chicken thighs were just as good in it and i stirred in the shrimp just before serving long enough for shrimp to get hot this dish is spicy but not mouth burning spicy as my hubby said it is spicy but not enough to make his bald spot sweat we will definitely be making this again
my family feel in love with this recipe i found it very easy to make with no fuss or bother it is a great meal if you need a quick meal that has substance to it
loved it we forgot to put the shrimp on the night we made it and it definitely was missing something we added shrimp on the second day and it was perfect definitely a keeper perfect with freshly baked bread to dip
very good but mine came out a little soupier than i expected the leftovers thickened up and were perfect i served it over brown rice next time i will use large or jumbo shrimp the medium shrived up too much
just omit the shrimp more than enough proteinmeat to make this dish
this isnt something i would normally make but i was wanting to branch out a little my family loves this which was a shock we have been making it on a regular basis for years now
great flavors
whenever i make dinner it is rare for the whole family to agree on it i rated this 5 stars because most of us enjoyed it my hubby loved the shrimp my mom loved the sausage and my aunt loved the texture one of my boys loved it but the other didn39t it had extra kick because i used a can of diced tomatoes wgreen chillies overall 4 thumbs up 1 12 thumbs down 12 is for my three yr old too spicy i think great recipe next time i39ll add more chicken but i think i39ll add it already cooked when i throw in the shrimp
family really liked this we didn39t even need the rice
this was a big hit spiced just right my husband added more hot sauce at the table but this is great as is it is definately a new family favorite i39m going to invite friends over just so we can share this
next time i would add more chicken i used three chicken breast and less sausage everything else was great
yes i will make this for my family again i would add a little more hot sauce it39s a keeper
made this for dinner family loved it will make again will probably and a little more hot sauce
i left out the celery and only put 12 of the cayenne pepper in which was just enough heat overall it had an excellent flavor
i used chicken thighs instead of breasts we like them better and mango chipotle sausage have a nice kick in this jambalaya i did in the crock pot as well and did it for longer so next time i will add the peppers at a later time added the shrimp the last 15 min and boy they were perfect served with corn bread and a salad
i have made this many times for just my family or tripled for a crowd always gets rave reviews easy to adjust for taste and heat this is easy to make healthy and filling
i39ve made this many times and even made it for a party i used kielbasa sausage and had the shrimp to add on the side i loved that the veggies were still crunchy and sometimes the times on slow cooker recipes are too long and the food is cooked too much this one is rightthanks
awesome recipe i actually added 1 teaspoon extra of pepper sauce just because i love spicy food served on rice and with cornbread and this was a great meal
delishus i loved it but i didnt add in peppers or anything spicy
served with sweet cornbread this is one of my family39s favorite dishes i use red peppers instead of green and increase the cayenne pepper and hot pepper sauce to give it more heat
everyone loved it quickeasy satisfying what more can you ask for
this was so good and easy i did it on the stove simmered 1hr 50 mins and used itilian spicy sausage looked at a lot of recipes i39m glad i used this one
my husband loves this dish
excellent flavor and a huge plus for being a onepotfixit forget it type of meal
definitely will make again followed recipe with exception of adding hot pepper flakes instead of cayenne really liked the hint of smoked flavor off the sausages
i made this for dinner last night as i am always looking for dishes to serve over rice and it was a huge hit my husband loved it he kept going back for more when i suggested omitting the shrimp next time he told me it was perfect the way it was he liked that this had a lot of flavor with just enough heat definitely a keeper
made it exactly as listed but no shrimp the flavor was wonderful and my husband thought so too we agreed that with all that wonderful flavor the shrimp would be overpowered anyway my husband doesn39t like rice and ate it like a bowl of stew will definitely make it again
made it exactly as listed but no shrimp the flavor was wonderful and my husband thought so too we agreed that with all that wonderful flavor the shrimp would be overpowered anyway could do with just the 1 tsp of salt and not the extra 14 tsp my husband doesn39t like rice and ate it like a bowl of stew will definitely make it again
we loved it i am going to make it monday for a group dinner meeting my only modification was to reduce the heat for myself i put the hot sauce on the table the flavor was wonderful thanks
made this last night and everyone loved itmy husband went nutsi didn39t do the slowcooker but browned all necessary ingredientsand then let simmer about 45 minutes it39s now on our favorites list lm
i make this all the time my boys love it it is very easy and tasty
excellent layers of flavor i didn39t make this in a crock pot because there wasn39t time i sauted all of the vegies in olive oil first added the spices except i used paprika instead of cayenne because my husband has acid issues i added 2 tbl of cumin and 2 tbl crushed bay leaves browned chicken and sausages added to mix brought to bowl in dutch oven and simmered for 45 minutes then added the shrimp and simmered 15 more minutes flavors were layered and distinct will add this to my chef39s list and serve with confidence to my clients
i substituted the cayenne pepper and hot sauce for tony cacheries and this was perfect kids loved it husband loved it
this was not spicy at all but very flavorful i cooked it longer and used 1 pound of shrimp
have made this recipe for years now glad to find it here on line so i can save it on here too family request this recipe from me all the time now i can forward this to them from here pictures and all
i was nervous that this would be too spicy but it was just perfect delicious will definitely make again and soon
my family absolutely loved this recipe i am getting ready to make it again really tasty
very good and easy to make it tastes better the next day
this is a wonderful recipe i used fire roasted tomatoes which gave a really great taste
i make this often and it never fails it is so easy and so delicious it is even better the next day real comfort food for fall and winter serve with warm bread or rolls and you have a great meal
i39ve made this recipe many times and even served it for a large party i do not add shrimp but i have them on the side i also use kielbasa sausage each time i fix it everyone loves it
family loved it i am making again this week but will add a tablespoon of brown sugar to cut the acid from the tomatoes it was quite juicy the first time i made it so i may also try adding the cooked rice to the slow cooker when i add the shrimp nice recipe
great so simple we usually leave out the shrimp just to save a trip to the grocery store very yummy
i tried the jamblaya recipe for the first time it was a hit i shared it with 3 other familys all the men looooved it try it
my husband loves jambalaya and i made this one and he loves it i will be making it again
love this jambalaya i have a favorite recipe i39ve made for years this is just as good amp easier i added the shrimp amp used andouille sausage plus the chicken
i made this without the shrimp wow it is very good i like the fact that it is a crock pot recipe love those i will be making this again
made this yesterday we like it went together quickly very easy having left overs today for lunch
i made it without the shrimp and it was very good it39s just spicy enough and really good over rice i did cook it on high though bc i thought 4 hrs on low might not be enough to cook the vegetables at 4 hrs on high everything was cooked but not mushy
just don39t add the seafood i make a great jambalaya without seafood but i use ham instead of chicken
i don39t eat shrimp or shellfish any suggestions on a substitute for the shrimp
going to try this tomorrow sounds yummy
love this recipe super tasty and is great as leftovers
amazing
i have made these for many people and everyone has raved about how moist and full of banana flavor they are
this is the best banana muffin recipe the muffins have a nice banana flavor and are moist i will definitely make this recipe again
best recipe ever
i made these muffins recently and they were easy and delicious i used half splenda and half sugar as well as the 34lighten up34 method of using unsweetened applesauce for the oil and following another reviewer39s advice i added cinnamon to the batter so good i highly recommend them
i should39ve reviewed this winner years ago it39s been my go to recipe for muffins for ages now i always add toasted walnuts or pecans plus some spices and sometimes i toss in whatever berries i have on hand always delicious and not a single failure with this great and simple recipe
i love this recipe so easy to make and delicious and the perfect solution for all those over ripe bananas i always seem to have lying around i39ll make these muffins again and again
i added about a tbsp of honey they were delicious definitely making these again
excellent
these were delicious i used this recipe as a base and added a tsp of cinnamon couple dashes of nutmeg 2 tsp ground flaxhempchia seed mix into dry ingredients after filling paper liners i added a few chocolate chips on the top of each and sprinkled with turbinado sugar before putting in oven these were done perfectly at about 19 min will save to make again and again thank you
tasty
i tried this today a simple recipe that worked perfectly absolutely delicious thank you for sharing
i made these today with all purpose gluten free flour 1 for 1 substitute regular ap flour and they turned out great too made an addition of chopped pecans very tasty great recipe thanks
i really loved these muffins i also added some walnuts on top and baked them they were so good that i had to make a second batch because my son had to take some home they were also so easy and quick to make
i enjoy these muffins i make with 8 packets of stevia instead of sugar and i also add either sliced almonds or walnut pieces if i39m short a banana i grate an apple into the mix i make 6 big muffins rather than 12
i was tempted to use my banana bread recipe to make muffins but i saw another reviewer did just that and was unhappy with the result these were good not quite what i was hoping for i would call them but they are really sugar and banana i think the thing that is missing is brown sugar maybe a mix of brown and white would give these a little more depth
this is my all time favorite banana muffin recipe they39re so quick and easy to make and they come out delicious every single time my family raves about them they39re also great to pop in the freezer for a couple of weeks i usually defrost one for a quick and easy breakfast or snack
this recipe is so easy and so good you don39t even take a mixer out we all loved them next time i will make a much larger batch so i will have a few to freeze grandkids liked them better than banana bread
this is absolutely delicious my family loves when i bake this recipe and i love it too it39s such a simple and delicious recipe this is definitely a must have recipe you39ve gotta try
amazing i made it with gluten free flour and substituted 14 cup apple sauce for the egg it was super moist and delicious next time i will add some blueberries
this is an excellent base recipe i39ve made several times and the muffins come out super moist every time i always add a 13 c of applesauce to ensure moistness and to add a bit of apple flavor to them sometime i sprinkel cinnamon in i39ve topped the muffins before cooking with semi sweet chocolate chips and i39ve also added walnuts and semi chocolate chips right to the batter tonight i realized i had run out of vanilla and substituted honey instead this is a great versatile recipe thank you so much for sharing
these are a hit in our house and when shared with friends and kids love them i39ve been making this recipe for years and they always come out perfectly they don39t dry out and keep well that39s if we have any left after a few days in a ziploc bag i add chocolate chips to ours at the end before putting in muffin cases
add milk next time you bake these
i have a very old recipe for banana bread that i thought i could just make muffins out of wrong this is my go to recipe now so moist i also add crushed pecans on top big hit especially with coffee in the morning
i always come back to these light texture and made with common pantry items like vegetable oil i put nuts on the tops of these muffins right before baking and it gives a great texture i share these with my toddler and i just eat the nutty tops myself win win
i had only 2 bananas so i added 1 chopped finely apple and smooshed with a fork every one loved them
one day i ran out of butter and stumbled across the recipe and i39ve never made another recipe since people devour them and always ask for the recipe no one cam ever believe how easy they are
i followed the recipe and i added crushed walnuts and 12 teaspoon of cinnamon the flavor was wonderful but i am so glad i over filled or they would have been flat disks they didn39t rise at all the muffins were very dense
it was really easy and simple but when i made these i set a timer for 16 minutes and very close to burnt i would suggest changing the cook time to something shorter so someone else make the mistake i did
really easy to make and very tasty only thing is the ingredients doesn39t mention vanilla but the directions does
i have been making these since the recipe came out in hardcover i remember the year my kids are adults now and still love it when i make these
this recipe was astounding i didn39t have vanilla onhand but it still tasted amazing i used a tsp of cinnamon and 18 of a tsp of nutmeg and it really added to the flavor i really recommend this recipe
we love this recipe and use it often i put half a cop of chocolate chips in it which my kids like
this is a great and easy to follow recipe i had all of the ingredients on hand which made making it even easier i made the recipe exactly as the directions stated the muffins were moist and delicious they were so easy to make my family loves them next time i will need to make a double batch
this is a really good recipe but i only use a third of a cup of sugar and they taste sweet enough especially if you have used very ripe bananas try adding half a cup of chopped hazelnuts too
i made these this morning and they are delicious i used 12 cup white sugar and 12 cup brown sugar instead of just 1 cup white sugar i added a splash of cinnamon and they are fantastic i cooked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes perfect timing i didn39t fill the muffin tin half way so they were a bit smaller than typical muffins but they39re a hit mix the brown sugar with the egg oil banana and vanilla extract then add to the dry ingredients
my whole family loved this sometimes we put mini dark chocolate chips in as a treat too
my goto banana muffin recipe i throw uneaten unpeeled bananas in the freezer so when i am ready i just thaw them and they are the perfect texture my only changes for this are that i use 12 brown and 12 white sugars mix the brown in with the eggsbananasoil i do bake at 350 perfect muffins
you might add a little cinnamon to this and while it was baking i read a review which told me to lower the temp to 350 and did this after 7 minutes of 375 they came out like out of the bakery and i am not a good baker but am a good cook also spingle a little caster sugar on top before baking and you get a sparkly top i also used only on over ripe banana
i believe the temp in this recipe it too high the muffins cooked too long on the bottom and was too soft in the middle the next batch i am turning it down to 350 for 1822 minutes
jean
i made this for mother39s day and they turned out fantastic they were moist they had rich banana flavordidn39t use too much ingredients and i decided to add a bit of cinnamon for my own touch i will definitely make these again
these muffins are great such an easy receipe to follow baking time of 22 mins is too much though i could have timed it for 15 mins but the texture is soft definitely making again
my family and i love making these muffins we add chocolate chips yummmmy and super easy
these were great and easy to make i did add some chopped walnuts and that added a lot plan to make these again and again
i didn39t have veg oil so i used coconut oil same amount and 2 bananas instead of 3 it was a awesome recipe taste amazing
delicious even though i made them without vainilla they turned out very fluffy my friends and family loved them definitely making them again thank you very much
these muffins are absolutely delicious made dozens and dozens of them added walnuts to some and dark chocolate chips to others also substituted the caster sugar for demeraralove them
batter looked dry so i added a half container 14 cup of mixed berry applesauce they turned out very good nice texture
these are great my kids love them we added 1 tsp of cinnamon because we love cinnamon in our banana muffins
they turned out perfect i39m still chuckling at some of the low ratings evidently you have a few people still learning how to bake check your baking soda and flour quality
i just made these during the pandemic i have a bowl of very ripe bananas i39m going to cut into 1439s and freeze for smoothies i hate to bake and most of my stuff turns out or not very well this was an easy recipe that didn39t take a lot of ingredients or brain power they turned out exceptionally well for us i39m definitely saving and will make again with ripe bananas
so i was looking for a banana muffin that required neither baking soda nor powder this recipe called for no powder and i was able to substitute soda with 1 whipped egg white i also used brown sugar and threw in some cinnamon and nutmeg it worked out great the muffins were perfectly moist and fluffy will definitely make again
very basic as it states i added chocolate chips and they still turned out very dense make again
heavy really awful
this is an amazing recipe my kids say only missing the chocolate chips
i followed recipe to a t have made muffins for years but these turned out dense
hey taste of home i love these so much and they were so easy to make i give a special thanks for this basic recipe thank you so much my family and i loved these so much again thank you jeanine salas
it didn39t take long for these muffins to disappear they are delicious made as is but i can39t wait to make the next batch adding cinnamon nutmeg and chopped nuts to the mix maybe the time after that some chocolate chipshmmmm
i39ve tried this before actually and it works really well though i want to know if you could make this into one big muffin for yourself if you don39t want a lot of muffins if you do can you make a recipe
would have been 5 stars but there was no spice luckily i realized this before putting into cupcake holders added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 18 tsp of nutmeg perfect these were now grandkids ready
eady and quick recipe but i added 12 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon also instead of 1 full cup of granulated sugar i used 12 cup of granulated sugar and 12 cup of brown sugar and they are yummy
make these every few weeks kids like to grab them on their way out the door in the morning best muffin recipe tried
best waffle i have ever made i39m allergic to bananas but overall the pancakes were worth the near death experience they say that you can see the light when you39re about to die but the only light i was seeing was because of the taste of the cupcakes they were amazing i almost died
added an entire grated zucchini to this recipe and my kids couldn39t taste the difference now i make these at least every other week for them
i made these today wow the best muffin i have had in a long time after reading the reviews i thought a muffin is a muffin what could be so wonderful about these i was wrong these are wonderful
i am allergic to eggs and gluten i made these with 12 the sugar milk instead of eggs13 cup and used my all in one gluten free flour also added 12 tsp of baking powder because more leavening is needed with my flour they came out perfect and my husband and i enjoyed them

i was looking for a good basic banana muffin recipe and this one fit the bill so simple to make and just delicious i threw some butterscotch chips into the batter because i needed to use them up next time i might try adding some peanut butter chips although chips are not necessary since the muffins stand on their own they39re moist and delicious with lots of banana flavor i did sprinkle some turbinado sugar on top of each muffin before baking this recipe is perfect for getting kids involved in the kitchen too i39ll definitely keep this recipe handy
these are delicious and so easy like others i like nuts so i added toasted walnuts definitely a keeper
saw this recipe yesterday and thought they sounded good my 23yearold son grabbed one this morning and declared them to be the best muffins he39s ever had and he39s not a muffin fan then grabbed two more hubby loved them and even though i39m not a banana fan i thought they were really good too

i have been dying to try out making banana bread so when i woke up to overripe bananas on monday i asked my helper not to throw them away coz i want to bake with them my daughter overheard us and said mama please make cupcakes and not bread since you don39t have bread tin lol so i came to google and found this recipe with my little baking experience and the reviews here i used half cup sugar and they were a hit and soooo moist the family murdered them so fast they begged me to make more because i was trying out the recipe i stuck to measurements except for the sugar of course but on the weekend i39m going to double it to make 2 dozen thank you for a simple fail proof recipe
these muffins are moist but way too sweet other recipes i used require less sugar and no vanilla i tried this anyway and more like a cupcake than muffin

yum super easy and tasty i added cinnamon which wad am excellent choice i do not own stand mixer but i enjoy the tiny chunks of banana very good with a honey butter spread
delicious muffins this is one of the easiest banana muffin recipes i39ve ever tried and it was the one with the best results i39ve made my fair share of banana muffins over the years and i think this recipe made the best muffins yet i kept the recipe completely as written but i did add about a half cup of chopped walnuts to the batter i love that it called for vegetable oil instead of crisco made it even faster to complete the recipe i would definitely recommend this recipe
wow these are the easiest most delicious muffins i39ve ever made i did 4 bananas instead of 3 and added a dash of pink himalayan salt as a final step use a handheld mixer to make things easier
super easy and quick i added some nuts everyone loved them
these muffins we39re fast easyand delicious they come out perfectly very moist and not too dense i added about 1cup of frozen blueberries to the batter which added to the flavor i will definitely use this recipe again
this recipe was quick and easy these muffins were delicious and were gone quick i39m making more and have already saved this for future bananas
such delicious muffins i made a few changes to the recipe i used 1 cup all purpose flour and 12 cup whole meal spelt flour i cut the sugar down to half a cup and substituted with coconut sugar my oil choice was coconut oil i added a cup of frozen blueberries too when in the muffin tray before baking i topped them with pepita seeds so good will make these again
these are yummy so quick and easy thanks for sharing
came out perfect
light and fluffy i added nutmeg and cinnamonand some coconut flakes a pinch of garam masala is nice in the top good basic easy recipe

the best banana muffins moist and sweet plus easy to make
very easy and tasty
this is a basic banana muffin recipe but very easy and very good
i39ve been making this recipe for months now but never rated it these are really easy to make fast if i want to take them somewhere or if someone is coming over i get between 14 and 16 muffins out of the single recipe my muffin tins are just the standard size not jumbo i add 13 cup mini chocolate chips to my recipe and sometimes chopped pecans or walnuts they are good just as the recipe is stated also i like the mini chocolate chips versus the larger ones so you taste more banana very good recipe and a keeper they also freeze well and i39ll pop one in the microwave for myself in the morning yum thanks for sharing lorna
this is a really great recipe especially for beginners the ingredients are really simple and the directions are easy to follow they came out great 1 c of sugar made it super sweet so i39ll put in less next timei didn39t have baking soda at the time so i used 3 tsp of baking powder as others suggested
great recipe half cup sugar is good and plenty especially if the bananas are ripe and sweet i substituted a quarter cup of oats for some of the flour
love this recipe great way to use up over ripe bananas that no one will eat
i have just made these and they were perfect in every way trying to cut down on sugar so i only put in half a cup instead of 3 bananas i put in 2 and added a small box of sultanas and a pear diced into small pieces then sprinkled some sunflower seeds on the top they were beautiful and definitely sweet enougheven for me thanks so much for sharing
perfect recipe the first time i added 1 cup dried cranberries because i love cranberries second time i added cranberries and chopped walnuts the muffins came out perfect finally i found a really really moist muffin recipe love the texture
seriously good and easy i did this all in one bowl and they came out perfect now i wish i had doubled the recipe
the whole family loved these muffins i added a few mini chocolate chips to them all and then added chopped walnuts to half baked them in mini muffin tins for about 13 minutes
fantastic and simple recipe loved it i added a few tablespoons of jam i needed to use up from the fridge and i loved the added depth of flavor
i love this recipe i squish my bananas in a big zip lock bag and then i add the rest of the ingredients liquids first to the same bag squish it up real good and then just snip the bag corner to easily fill my muffin tins sooo easy
excellent muffins definitely a keeper
wow were these good really moist and filling with the oats definitely a keeper
this recipe was great i cut the sugar in half and it was still a hit in our house this will be my new go to for banana muffins
these are by far the best banana muffins i added about a 13 cup of cinnamon applesauce amp they came out extremely moist i filled the muffin tins over half full amp it made 23 muffins even after 2 days in the fridge they are still moist as ever very easy amp definitely a hit with the family this is my new go to recipe for ripe bananas enjoy
this is my favorite banana muffin recipe because i don39t have to deal with shortening or butter i do add about 1 t of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and accidentally added a second egg the muffins were super moist i only needed about 17 minutes of baking and they were pretty dark on the outside still looked good but not that golden color that could just mean my oven isn39t accurate entirely possible
this recipe is a keeper i printed it off to add to my recipe collection my bananas were very large so i used 2 12 i added about 13 to 12 cup of mini chocolate chips i also topped some with raw sugar and the rest i sprinkled on large sugar crystals that i use to top cookies i liked the 34crunch34 that the sugar gave to the muffins muffins do take the full baking time and then i baked a couple of minutes more i got 18 muffins from the recipe
these are simple to make and tasty for a treat or quick breakfast what i like most about this recipe is how easy it is to jazz up i add chopped walnuts or chocolate chips to it sometimes a dash of almond extract instead of vanilla this is my goto recipe to use up ripened bananas it39s quick and my family scarfs them down in no time
this was a huge hit at my office just as the previous reviewer said in the recipe i usually make it has use a slightly different ratio of flour and sugar 2 c flour and 12 sugar so it39s the same volume of dry ingredients but the first time i made this recipe i followed it as written i thought it would be too sweet with double sugar i39m used to tasting and three sweet ripe bananas but it wasn39t too sweet at all in fact the person in my office who usually is most concerned with sugar content raved about these and with good reason too because they are delicious if you want to reduce the sugar by up to half the called for amount they are still yummy but just remember to compensate by adding flour equal to the reduction in sugar personally i39m fine with 1 c sugar the only variations i use are to sprinkle the top of each muffin with about 18th tsp of raw unwashed sugar before baking because the big crystals bake a nice caramelized sugar crunch to the muffin tops i also preheat the oven 100 degrees higher than baking temp then when i put the muffins in drop the temp to the correct temp i found these indeed take the full 18 min or so even with the high preheat temp supposedly the high preheat temp makes them crown higher without over baking them as a side note parchment paper cupcake liners work the best if you have them thanks for reading my long review again killer recipe i39ve made it several times now with great results each time thank you so much for a great addition to my muffin rotation
super easy to make i took them to work and they were a hit devoured in less than 2 hours i will definitely make again i added a little milk and decreased the oil to 14 cup thank you for my new muffin recipe
my family loves these muffins instead of 1 cup sugar i always use 12 cup white and 12 brown sugar also add some chopped pecansyummy
very good and easy to make i used splenda blend sugar and omitted the vanilla because i didn39t know that i didn39t have any until i went to add it mine baked in 16 minutes and made 11 muffins they are so good and moist we ate them warm and cold and loved them
these are so easy amp good my whole family loved them i used 4 bananas to get more of a banana flavor
i have been making these for my youngest daughter since she was 2 and at 15 she still asks for them any time she sees that we have old bananas i added cinnamon and usually use 4 bananas which makes a bit more than 12 dozen silkiepearls blueberries are excellent in it i make her dozen and then i add blueberries to the rest for mine i put how ever many i am in the mood for and always use frozen
i love this recipe so easy to make and ingredients are very basic kids at home love it too you can make these even when in a bit of a rush thanks
these muffins are spectacular they are really good i39ve tried several recipes and none came out as moist and flavorful as these as one other reviewer suggested i did half a cup of granulated sugar and 14 cup of brown sugar i also used half whole wheat flour and half white flour also just barely mix it until the wet folds into the dry
so delicious and so easy this is now my goto recipe for using up old bananas

this recipe makes a great banana muffin i replaced half the white flour with whole wheat flour and i added 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds the muffins came out perfect
these were so easy to make i added chocolate chips to mine i have started subbing in applesauce for the oil and you can39t even tell
this is now my goto banana muffin recipe i sometimes add 1c of blueberries or 1c diced strawberries i always add about 12c chopped walnuts or pecans i make 18 instead of 12 muffins because of the additions and i found the original recipe to be just too much for only 12 muffins everybody loves these muffins yeeeaaa
these were easy to mak and very good
very good
best ever my 34go to34 muffin recipe especially when i have extra bananas around i have made this 1001 times there are so many ways to tweak this and the result is always perfect i always decrease the oil to 14 cup then add a heaping tablespoon of either vanilla yogurt sour cream or applesauce to compensate i also always decrease the sugar by a few tablespoons and you would never know sometimes i add some shredded zucchini by decreasing an equal amount of banana my mom39s favorite way to enjoy these was warmed in the microwave with a dab of butter they are also good with chocolate chips mixed in or by adding a streusel topping
i made this recipe just as described and the muffins turned out great i did add 12 cup of walnuts which was a great addition i highly recommend this for its ease
this is a very good recipe that works up quick i did substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil which cuts down on the fat and calories and makes it very moist and tasty this recipe is a keeper

this is the best banana muffin recipe i have made i like to add 13 cup chopped pecans

pmy only concern is my will power to not eat too many they are delicious and easyp
love this
can you freeze both a cooked one due to leftovers and also an uncooked one i have made it in the past followed the recipe and it was delicious
fabulous
the original recipe published in the febmarch 2002 tofh magazine calls for only 12 cup flour i believe there is a typo in this online version because 12 cup worked well
next time will skip the flour i read all the reviews before trying this for the first time i agree with the review about the flour quantity i cut it to 12 cup of flour but still the sauce became like spackle i had to add an additional 1 12 quarts of liquid to make the sauce creamy next time i will try just an alfredo sauce with butter parmesan and cream and maybe some white wine also i added old bay to the seafood liquid and subbed shallots and garlic for the green onion overall it was delicious
a family favorite
ive made this recipe many times in fact it39s my husband39s requested birthday meal every year i make it just as recipe states because i believe if you adjust things you should rate a different recipe the only ratings of this recipe should be before adjusting 5 star perfect every time
has anyone ever done a half recipe of this before we love seafood lasagna but we always have way too much leftover
made this seafood lasagna recipe many many times and it has always turned out perfect every time the creamy texture is perfect and the taste is amazing i would strongly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves seafood and lasagna the only change i made was i substituted the parmesan cheese for mozzarella and lots of it delicious
not a fan 1 cup of flour created a stiff gloopy glue surely this must be an error i ended up adding some extra milk cream chicken stock just trying to make it a little more smooth it is extremely bland as well i added some garlic but would suggest adding some of that old bay others have suggested i seriously understand how this is award winning or how some people ended up with it being runny after adjusting the consistency of the i was able to create a lasagna i added a little mozzarella to the top my youngest son thought it was good but not great probably best for those who prefer a bit of a bland palate
we love this recipe but would like to know if it can be frozen before or after baking
after reading some comments and having previous experience with alfredo sauce i added some lemon juice a touch of old bay seasoning garlic and used a shallot instead of the green onion and the sauce was absolutely delicious with those modifications
this is a wonderful recipe to use i modified it but adding some adobo recaito and sazon when preparing the onions and seafood if you39ve never tried adding spanish seasonings to recipes give it a whirl they give any recipe a new spin on taste
completely underwhelmed with the recipe as written not enough flavor only thing i did differently was add garlic while sauteing the onions i wont be making this again
excellent well worth the cost of the seafood
this is absolutely the best lasagna i have ever made or eaten made by the recipe and the only change was the addition of some lobster and used real crab instead of imitation only down side is the cost of good seafood for the preparation maybe splurge again for christmas
i added lobster meat as well the fam loved it
fabulous i added mozzarella cheese on top and within layers also some ricotta cheese in the middle
made this twice absolutely delicious made it today for my sister39s birthday she39s never had it can39t wait for her to taste it
i will agree with other comentors it is a very tasty dish but a little bit of old bay added a great deal to the flavor a little dash of lime enhanced it as welland next time i will add some garlic it just seemed to be missing something in its purist form be prepared because this recipe makes a lot of lasagna and it is very fattening and high in cholesterol i cut it in half and still had a lot of leftovers also i think you would be hard pressed to prepare this in 35 minutes plan on at least an hour lastly get your credit card or checkbook out because it is not an inexpensive meal to make once a year on special occasions or if we are having company and want to impress i still liked it though
well based on some of the reviews yes i made some changes bc of the changes i was able to make two lasagnas and i used the no boil lasagna winwini added a ricotta mix to make this dish like a lasagna to my ricotta i like to add chili powder egg garlic powder salt fresh cilantro and black pepper i think the chili powder help to bring out the flavor to the whole dish bc it is a creamy dishi did add fresh chopped garlic when i cooked the green onions but i also added and cooked 1 diced white onion tooi doubled the creamy mix bc i used the no boil lasagna noodles and i felt the ratio of the seafood shrimp cut into 3 pieces if using large shrimp 1lb scallops 1lb and claw crab meat 1lb would have needed the extra saucei did not expect to make 2 but i did one dish had 4 noodle layers and my other dish just had 3 noodle layersi did noodle ricotta mozzarella and parmesean cheese layer followed by seafood sauce then repeat the layers be sure to reserve just a cup of sauce without the seafood for the top last layer of the lasagna i did top that with mozzarella too i didn39t reserve sauce for my 2nd dish top noodle so it was covered with the seafood i didn39t want it to burn so that one had extra mozzarella cheese on ityes this is a heart attack waiting to happen but if you are going for it then go for it i wouldn39t make this everyday maybe special occasions everyone loved it i made it for a potluck it is a little time consuming but oh so good the other dish i gave pieces away i only wanted 2 pieces bc i am health conscious but no doubt with my changes it was goodi don39t measure but i used this recipe as a guideline
i rated this a 4 because it tasted ok however it is missing garlic i don39t feel this is a lasagna but a seafood alfredo using lasagna noodles it is seafood with an alfredo sauce except for the missing garlic and lasagna noodles
absolutely delicious i made it instead of my usual recipe and it was awesome would make a great soup also best online recipe i have ever made
a great lasagna recipe i like to add thinlysliced mushrooms as the crab scallop shrimp and cream sauce mixture can become a little rich without the mushrooms to balance it out i also believe in splurging a little more on real lump crab meat as opposed to imitation crab meat as this dish is one that deserves the best
i make this a couple of times a year usually for a special occasion always a hit
the family loved this of course with everything you put your own spin on it according to your household pallet i only added and didn39t remove anything the recipe called for i doubled the recipe large house of 9 i added 1 onion old bay seasoning red pepper flakes frozen and squeeze drained spinach also topped it with cheddar cheese it was absolutely amazing only downfall it was pretty pricey but worth it
an excellent recipe i used a bit more shrimp as my family is not fond of scallops fish cubes for stock is a good subsitution for both the chicken stock and clam juice if you do that cut back on the salt this is a rich and satisfying meal it looks and tastes sophisticated freezes well too
very very good definitely making this again
can this be made the night before and cooked the next day as i often do regular lasagna
fantastic i expected this dish to be delicious based on the standing 5 star rating but it was even better than i expected could hold it39s own against any seafood lasagna i39ve eaten at restaurants agree with other comments great for christmas or special occasion meals as it is really rich and can be pricy my recipe adaptations based on seafood avail in ks 225 lbs king crab legs not alaskan 2 lbs sea scallops since they were almost half as expensive as bay and are more tender cut into smaller pieces 2lbs frozen wild salad shrimp costco using the fresh crab was well worth it once i was done cracking it all the flavor was amazing i added 68 roasted garlic cloves to the sauce as well my entire family loved this lasagna including kids and some pickier people i will absolutely make this again actually less expensive per lb than canned crab i also doubled the recipe as others and so glad i did i also used delallo organic italian whole wheat lasagna no boil noodles which are my go to for lasagna
oh my goodness this dish is absolutely fantabulous i used 15 pounds of shrimp 12 ounces 1 pound 16 ounce of real jumbo lump crab meat and 15 pounds of bay scallops 12 ounces i doubled everything else i also added fresh garlic to my green onion mixture and i added the garlic just before i added the broth and juices i used costco39s fresh aged parmigiano reggiano cheese my sauce was not bland at all it was thick rich and decadent also in the doubling process i used an 8 ounce bottle of clam juice and an 8 ounce bottle of lobster juice be sure to drain the seafood stock from the meat to ensure your source isn39t runny additionally because mine did not brown after 38 minutes of baking i put it under the broiler for about 2 minutes it was perfect while the seafood makes the dish costly it was well worth it i will certainly be making it again
i made this for christmas dinner it was a huge hit and my daughter requested it for her birthday dinner i used canned crabmeat instead of the imitation stuff even though it was finely shredded it worked extremely well and actually gave some body to the sauce i also used just a little extra shrimp scallops and crabmeat it was fantastic and will be a goto for special dinners
if you love seafood this is a real hit i made it for the first time last night and shared with friends everyone loved it i did use real crab meat i39ll be sure to drain the pot with seafood better next time as the sauce was just a bit runny but it was still delicious i also used whole wheat lasagna
i have to join the other 5 star raters with this one its very rich and wonderful impressive and very satisfying i did use a few suggestions i feel that this recipe will do just fine with just 2 seafood choices if crab is one of them use fresh next time i will just use shrimp amp crab i also reduced the clam juice and used a dry sherrythis recipe will serve quite a few so i downsized it to just 2i also feel that this would be perfect for stuffing pasta shells next time for surejanietaste of home volunteer food editor
oh my my my this was soooooo good all i changed was i used regular onions and spenich h and it was so good i will make this again sooner than later
this is the bomb when i take it out to potluck it is the first dish emptied everyone asks for the recipe
delicious my sauce was a little bit runny after it baked i39ll be sure to thicken it a bit more next time but this recipe is definitely a keeper
my family thought this was the best dish ever there were no leftovers and i think if i39d doubled it they would have still eaten all of it
time consuming to make slightly expensive to afford but oooh sooo good every time i make this i have to double the recipe can be frozen and baked later does not seem to effect the taste or texture i love that it is 100 from scratch to who ever come up with this recipe 34well done34
this is the besta real family favorite if you love seafood and pasta you39ll love this
best seafood lasagna i39ve made to date in all categories taste texture and presentation relatively easy felt good going together i substituted 12 lb of fresh crabmeat for the imitation crab my foodie dinner guests thought it was one of the best they have ever tasted note that it is very rich and easily serves 12 when making for just ourselves i think i39ll cut this into 15 pieces
j39adore la vie d39amour a very sensual lasagna for a valentine39s evening
i am preparing this to night for the 2015 super bowl patriots fan serving this tomorrow with chili home made sausage onions and peppers and your delicious seafood lasagna will keep you posted go patriots
wow just wow a sinfully rich and creamy big occasion lasagna for sure i made no changes except to omit green onions use my own favoured combo of seafood shrimp squid and snapper fish and to make extra of the white sauce as advised by a lot of reviewers served this at a late night christmas eve gathering and the whole thing was polished off in minutes and everyone raved about how good it was i am especially pleased at how flavourful the white sauce was and the seafood wasn39t overcooked at all because of the double cooking process seafood is boiled then baked yummm
de39 licious made for christmas 2014 used real crab meat very very good
i made this recipe a few times for guest everyone loves it very rich but well worth it
a truly amazing rich lasagna mmmmm good
love this lasagna
delicious with lobster meat instead of crab
very good recipe i had made it on christmas day used real crab meat it is one of those special occasion recipes
this is a truly delicious lasagna the leftovers taste amazing too i will definitely make this again next time i won39t precook the seafood the shrimps were slightly overcooked in mine still i can39t complain this recipe is a keeper
don39t try this on kids39 activity night this dish is timeconsuming but ohso worth it 34imitation34 crabmeat i don39t think so i use 3 6oz cans lump crabmeat i also use half amp half instead of whipping cream which is what i do for all recipes calling for whipping cream other than those 2 changes minor the recipe is excellent as written
i made this for father39s day it was delicious it had the perfect combination of seafood i used real crab meat
its is a very good recipe however i find using too much real crab meat will give it an overwhelming taste that39s most likely why they suggest imitation crab meat
this was sooo good i made it using frozen shrimp and scallops both defrosted wonderful taste rich and creamy will definitely make it again
being a creole girl from new orleans la i simple love seafood i tried this dish but i used real lump crab meat added the holy trinity onion bell pepper and celery added white cooking wine to the sauce and added a dash of old bay seasoning chile39 my husband still licking his fingers
yum added a tablespoon of brandy to the white sauce and it really brought out the flavor and creaminess i39ve also made this where i mixed the white sauce and seafood mix and then poured it into a 9x13 over cheese ravioli cooked at 350 until bubbly one of my family39s favorites
hi phillips66 i recently moved and in the process lost my treasured copy of gourmet magazine with the seafood lasagna recipe you refer to above i remember there was whitefish in the recipe and the wine was reduced along with bones acquired from the fishmonger i wondered if you still have that recipe i would love to get it back thank you jb
my husband couldn39t stop raving about this dish i used fresh crab but everything else was the same it was work intensive but will make again for a special occasion or large gathering
i also did some minor changes as i did not have the scallops on hand i used twice the imitation crab used 2 cans of crab meat drained and medium sized tail on shrimp it was work intensive but it turned out amazing i will make this again and again
this recipe was okay the first time i made it except for the imitation crab meat and the lack of seasoning the second time i made it i made some changes i used real crab meat twice as much as the recipe calls for i also poached some fresh caught fish and deboned them and added the fish meat to the recipe i did not use scallops because i didn39t have any i live on the water and have access to fresh fish shrimp and crabs so that is what i used i also added a little garlic and some cajun seasoning i doubled the sauce recipe and used a lot more cheese the second time i made it it turned out better i will give the original recipe a three star rating and the recipe after my few changes still just three stars and no i will not make it again it serms like something is missing i think it39s the ricotta cheese that my seafood lasagna recipe calls for
i served this recipe with a few changes lobster instead of crab added mushrooms tried to keep down the calories by using 2 milk instead of the whipping cream amp all chicken broth instead of clam juice to a discerning group of ladies with compliments all around the table i plan to make this sauce amp serve it over pasta or rice next time the rice should nicely 34sop it up34
wonderful
made this for my husband for our anniversary it was absolutely delicious definitely will make again
i made this for christmas everyone loved it next time i will double the sauce
one of my alltime favorites i use sea scallops large shrimp and real crab meat double the sauce to accompany the larger quantities of seafood used i also add a good shake of white wine while making the sauce learned that one from gourmet magazine many years ago it is a holidayspecial occasion recipe for my company always a stellar hit
amend the recipe to include real crabmeat and then add another star to the rating system and we have a winner with my family a little pricey because i have to double my recipe for my family but worth every penny and is still less than the seafood dinners and more portions and better quality than dining out
i39ve made this a number of times l cut the shrimp up to the size of the scallops i do it in pyrex so it can go out right in the dish everyone loves it nice salad white wine and crusty bread great janet
why would anyone use imitation crabmeat in a wonderful dish like this spend a couple more dollars and get the real thing it is so much more flavorful
this was delicious i substituted gluten free lasagna noodles and an almond based flour and used real crabmeat fantastic it was a huge hit at my dinner party and our gluten intolerant friend appreciated it
the only change i made was to use real crabmeatperfect
i make this every christmas everyone loves it i find that i use much less of the sauce because it comes out thicker and less soupy i all so use big scallops big shrimp and real crabmeat it truly is a special meal
this is the bestme and my daughter made it for a 34girls night34 and it was a big hit all my friends enjoyed one even asked for the recipe there was no leftovers i did make one alteration like a few others i doubled the chicken broth and only used half the clam juice the wine recomendation helped also
delicious this was a hit with my family the only substitute i used was good crab instead of imitation a bit of work but so well worth it
i made this at home and liked it so much that i made this for our local volunteer fire company39s annual banquet we served 200 people we made it the day before and cooked it the next day it was so good i received many request for the recipe
this was a bit of work to make but well worth it scallops are pretty expensive where i live and the recipe is short on veggies so i used a 12oz frozen bag of bird39s eye marsala mix mushrooms onions and garlic in place of them it was perfect my family was scrapping the sauce from their plates with their forks
a good friend made this lasagna amp it39s been on my mind since then it is delicious i asked her for the recipe amp she sent it from this website this lasagna was just delicious i39d never had a seafood lasagna and it was any amp everything i could imagineseasoned well she made a few changes to the recipe i will be making this delightful dish soon amp for company amp holidays 0
i have made this recipe a few times this is one of my favorites i have also shared it with friends and passed the recipe along also i do make it with lobster though instead of crab
just finished eating my first attempt at this recipe and it was great did make a couple of changesadded 4 chopped onions and one clove of minced garlic didn39t have clam juice so used 12 of clamato juice and increased chicken broth to 1 cup we are looking forward to leftover tomorrow
this recipe was off the charts six years ago my husband and i were in venice and ate at 34the black cat restaurant34 in burano he had a seafood lasagna and has been asking me to make it since i finally found this recipe and made it yesterday father39s day wellhe flipped it was sooo delicious told me that it is his favorite dish ever asked me to make it again for his birthday in september thank you so much for this recipe
delicious i had to double the recipe because i have 4 kids but still tasted great
i was looking for a quick and tasty recipe for our housewarming dinner 5 adults 2 kids can i just say that this recipe was amazing not a labour of love like other lasagna recipes there was plenty for everyone including left overs i will definitely make this againi use another reviewers suggestion double the chicken broth and half the clam juice and 4 spring onions and black pepper instead of white didn39t have any i also added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the seafood very nice recipe
this was phenomenal i would certainly make this again i followed the recipe and had nothing but compliments
this was very yummy the only change made to the recipe was 1 cup of chicken broth amp 12 cup of clam juice because other commented about the fishy taste also more seasoning to taste that noted
i made this last night and my guests couldn39t get enough of it and asked for the recipe six of us ate the whole plan i served it with a salad and herbed bread i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect the sauce was creamy and smooth i found out that bay scallops the small ones are sweeter than the big scallops which tend to be tasteless i made it in the morning and cooked it at night next time i39ll try making it the night before just because i like to do as much as possible beforehand it was easy to make my husband can39t wait for me to make it again
awesome
i cut this recipe in half mostly to fit in an 834x834 square pyrex pan used a 12oz bag of frozen shrimp half a pound of bay scallops and 8 oz of 34lobster delights34 some sort of surimi flavored the cream sauce with a couple tablespoons of dry white wine served with garlic bread and a green salad with raspberry vinaigrette quite excellent
i made for dinner last night amazing and simple to make
very tasty
i have made this many times and had rave reviews have even baked ahead and froze still was excellent if you don39t want to spend the money for scallops you can use more shrimpimitationcrab
tastes great i used real clam not imitation it did take quite some time to prepare but was worth it
this recipe was horrible i cannot understand how so many reviewers rated it so high i will definitely not be making this again
i made this for christmas dinner based on the reviews submitted and ended up having to throw the entire casserole out after tasting it it was grossvery 34fishy34 and bland the clam juice and crabmeat were overpowering i used backfin i can39t imagine anyone enjoying this recipe
turned out great easy and tasty thanks for sharing
this was a bit time consumingbut well worth it it is very rich so you won39t eat much but it is just as good rewarmed for another meali have made this recipe several times and will make it many times more
every year this is my husbands no matter who shows up it39s gone and everyone raves about it
agree with most of the reviews definitely an excellent recipe used 12 amp 12 instead of cream still very rich and creamy also used the clam juice from a can of chopped clams and used the clams instead of the crabmeat added some minced garlic extra green onion and extra parmesan cheese looking forward to the leftovers
this is one of the best lasagna39s i39ve ever eatenedre to summy the one thing about you you39re consistent your consistantly giving bad reviews you said it was too rich and had to throw away i don39t believe you threw something this expensive away next time give it to the poor or someone that needs it if you read the recipe before making it you would of know with cream etc was going to be on the rich side or like other veiwers they knew to modify it to their liking please grow up and reconsider making bad reviews before publishing them were tired of reading them thank you
love it i knew you will love this
thick creamy sauce not overly fishy great texture an excellent recipe excellent
this is a wonderful dish to make for a dinner with friends everyone has raved about it when i have served it
this recipe is to die for i made it twice in one week the second time i made it for a big family get together and everyone was asking me for the recipe i used sea scallops and real crab meat so it can be pretty pricey to make but it is worth every single penny delicious
i have made this recipe numerous times since first discovering it last year i followed other reviewers39 suggestions and used coconut oil in place of oil and butter i also used half and half in place of the heavy cream i use shrimp scallops and real crab meat living in maryland this is a must the recipe is rich but bursting with flavor and is oh so yummy my husband our 12 year old and our 7 yo love this my parents in law and siblings love it as well if you are seafood lovers this won39t serve 12 maybe 8 i highly recommend this great
i had made this for my sons birthday party during lentand i had people ask for the recipei will be making this again and am so looking forward to itit is creamy rich and tastes like something you would get in an expensive restaurantif your looking for something to serve to gueststhis is it
i didn39t care for this one either as another reviewer noted it39s very rich and i love seafood too i ended up throwing it out
i just didn39t like this one too rich and too seafoody and i love seafood
we love this recipe and it39s become the birthday dinner choice for my daughter year after year
made this last night and it was so delicious very rich butter and cream will be looking to try and modify to make a tad more 34light34 i also neglected to pay attention to how much it madeso i had a lot left over for a family of 4 with 2 small childrenlooking forward to enjoying the leftovers
made this for a dinner party of 6 and everyone loved it will make it again
this is absolutely delicious however no way does it serve 12 we had 6 for dinner and have enough for one person to have leftovers it is not as high as it shows in the picture three layers is just not that high i didn39t add the fake crab and don39t think it was missed i will definitely make it again and pass on the recipe
my husband and i loved this dinner very easy to make it is definitely a recipe that will be going into my recipe box as only the best go in there
i39ve been making this recipe for years but we like it best as seafood enchiladasi make it as the recipe says then take the seafood out of the sauce put in flour tortillas top with a little shredded mozz cheese roll up and top with the sauce and shredded parmesan bake in 325 oven til sauce is hot and cheese is melted
the family really like this one
i have made this recipe quite a few times and every time is a successeverybody loves itas a side note i also add lobster meat usually an 8oz package
made this for the second time for my daughter and her familythey loved itvery good will make again for sure
we thought this was really good going to make it for my daughter and son in lawvery good
best dinner ever
incredible my husband complained that i don39t cook for him the same fancy meals i used to and was hoping this would redeem myself it sure did i added spinach as suggested by another user and also a touch of fresh dill personal preference and it was just right
this was an excellent recipe this recipe is now my husbands favorite it was easy to make but it did take me a little longer than 35 min to make it it was worth it though because it was absolutely delicious i am going to make this when i have my next dinner party this is definitely a keeper
this is a well put together recipe i followed it to the letter and i did find the sauce a bit too pasty maybe less flour next time and bland it needs more seasoning only salt and pepper was called for in the recipe but i would definitely experiment with other spices as well and up the green onions from 1 to like 4
i followed the recipe exactly and it was very good i think the next time i make it i will use a linguine noodle instead
this is the first time i have rated a recipe that39s how awesome this seafood lasagna was people are asking me for the recipe thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe
this is the best seafood lasagna that i have ever had my family loved it i did add a small amount of garlic powder for a bit more flavor other than that i followed the recipe as written can39t wait to make it again next timei might try to lighten it up a bit
what good timing i was just about to search for this my ds has requested it again this year for his birthday dinner
oh wow i made this just as something to look forward to on a weeknight because i was tired of the winter blahs my whole family loved this and i was told to put it in my special 34favorites34 book thanks so much for sharing
i made some adjustments the most important i thought were to make a seafood stock from the shrimp shells to use in lieu of the chicken stock i use crabmeat rather than sealegs i prefer the more delicate taste of shallots and 13 cup of sherry adds a wonderful depth of flavor to the sauce
made this for hubby and me today and we really like it ingredients are quite spendy and it is also not a low cal meal i think it would be a very elegant dish for special occasions with friends and familya lot for two to eat i wonder how well it will keep and reheat
delicious added 1 pkg of frozen chopped spinach thawed and squeezed dry
sometimes i ajust recipies to my liking not this one i make this for special occasions my husband loves seafood lasagna i make it every valentines day but anytimes would be good
i made this for my family for valentines day very yummy and even better the next day even my picky son ate 2 helpings i39ll use real crabmeat next time though
amazingthis was soo sinfully goodi made if from my hubby for valentines day we are hooked
i39ve made this a few times for large groups and always get raves on it i substitute coconut oil for the butter and oil
i first made this in 2002 and have made it for christmas every year since as a special meal request from my sons when i host christmas for my coworkers it is requested also it is a treasured recipe and i am so glad that i tried it
omg fantastic
so good packed with yummy seafood its creamy and good how could you go wrong here
this is a keeper my husband just loved it i did use skim milk and smart balance and it was excellent
everyone loved this recipe i topped with mozzarella too yummy
very smooth and the taste is great this is my second time making it very good
made this for christmas dinnerdon39t let it fool you that it takes 35 minutes to assemble this by far is the best seafood lasagna recipe i subbed imitation lobster for the crabmeat because i had it i also used no cook noodles for time saving i suggest putting 4 noodles across making a total of 12
tried this recipe for christmas dinner i did make a few modifications i used 1 pound of maine lobster meat 1 lb of sea scallops cut in quarters and 1 lb fresh maine shrimp i also increased the lasgana noodles to 4 noodles abreast for a total of 12on a scale of 1 to 10 this meal was a 15 my husband 34 the red meat eater34 said it would be a toss up between my notorious prime rib meal or this new recipe it was easy to make and the flavor undescribable he even mentioned he wanted to lick his plate you will not be disappointed if you try this 10 stars in my book
yes it can be made ahead and refrigerated makes it even better also it freezes really well also i was afraid to freeze it but it turns out even better gonna make some tonight and freeze it for christmas eve next week
rich creamy and excellent
can this be assembled ahead of time refrigerated then cooked if so how much time should be added to the cooking time
this is a wonderful recipe that i now make just for special occasions elena if you have any more of your 34specials34 we would love to get them carol stuart fl
what type of imitation crabmeat is best to use from a can or is there a package type in refrigerated or frozen section also it turned out a little runny what do you advise
i make this every year for christmas eve and family reunion and other times throughout the year everyone loves it and it is easy to make
i have made this so many times that i could do it blindfolded this is the best lasagna i39ve ever had my grandson will call me and ask me to make it for him everytime he comes to visit i even have a cousin who offers to pay me to make it lol this is truly the best thank you so much for sharing this
i introduced this dish to my family for our 2008 christmas dinner this seafood lasagna was very delicious i appreciate that the recipe was well written the measurements for the ingredients were perfect as were the directions since everyone enjoyed it i know i will be preparing this recipe again thank you
i used the no cook lasagne noodles and it worked just great this is an excellent recipe and quite deliciousrosie knight quincy il
i39ll be making this for the first time for my fiance39s family for christmas wish me luck
i first made this in 2002 and have done it at least once a year since usually on a holiday you have plenty of baking to prepare the other dishes
i made this for company and it was delicious my husband doesn39t like scallops so i used 2 pounds of shrimp and the imitation crabmeat i didn39t let it sit for 15 minutes after i took it out of the oven and it was really runny i guess that39s why you39re supposed to let it sit my bad i used smart balance butter and fatfree halfandhalf and as the other poster said it turned out fine i think next time i might skip doing the lasagna part i39ll just make the sauce and put it over linguine and sprinkle the parmesan cheese over the whole thing definitely a keeper
this is an absolutely wonderful seafood recipe i make it whenever i want my husband to do something around the house as a 34bribe34 i very often 34slim it down34 however and use skim milk in place of the cream and a no trans fat margerine in place of the butter you would never miss the extra fat jfs
i39ve been making this recipe for a couple of years now i really thought i had reviewed but i didn39t see it on here so i39m reviewing it again this is the best seafood lasagna i39ve ever had i have several family members from out of town who will call and ask if i will make this for them when they come to visit it39s a little time comsuming but well worth it thanks so much for sharing this recipe it39s definitely a jewel
i39ve been making this salad for several years always a hit guests are disappointed if i don39t serve it at our parties
this grape salad is sumptuous right before i started making it my husband informed me he didn39t really like grapes well once he tasted the finished recipe he absolutely loved it he couldn39t get enough our grown son and i loved it also i will be making it for the second time tomorrow this time using red grapes green grapes and black grapes yum
my go2 take to all friends and family get togethers it is alway requested this salad goes with everything
just made this so delicious
loved i used green grapes only
this is so yummy i used the red grapes only and it was just as good
not exactly the healthiest but oh so delicious i do back off the sugars a bit because the grapes are usually super sweet i39ve made this several times and everyone seems to enjoy it
i have been making this not as a grape salad but as a fruit dip for years i make a double recipe omitting the brown sugar and nuts and refrigerate overnight with a variety of different fruits to get dip and fruits very cold before serving i place in a pretty bowl in the center of a platter with different fruits placed all around the bowl i use pineapple chunksfresh or canned strawberries grapes blueberries apples navel orange sections etc etc whatever fruit you desire a great family gathering party or baby shower dish we love this as an all fruit dip
you can also add shredded cheese to the cream cheese amp sour cream mixture thick shredded gives it texture i39m going to try the mascarpone amp greek yogurt next time also someone asked why cut the grapes you should always cut them they are a choking hazzard for elderly and children also out of brown sugar make your own 1 cup granulated sugar 1 tbs molasses mix store in a zip lock baggy
i have had grape salad for the first time on my job 3 years ago i fell in love with this dessert ever since then i found this recipe and the best love love love it
great taste easy to makecut the grape in half was the hard part lol
someone asked 39is there a complimentary ingredient you could add to this grape salad39 my cousin adds one large diced apple i39ve eaten her version and the dressing compliments an apple of choice as well as the grapes so delicious either way
delicious i am a huge fan of the 34dressing34 and the grapes are just a reason to make it if i make this for a gathering i39ll add the pecans but for just me and my husband i can leave them off i39ve already shared this with my mom
i made this recipe after having it at work one day and this was better than what i had very creamy and i change anything just added more brown sugar and nuts 10 stars for me
i have been making this for years and everyone loves it my recipe calls for 45 tablespoons of brown sugar and to put half in the dressing and the rest sprinkled with the nuts the biggest thing is to dry the grapes after washing them if they are wet the dressing slides off i live close by marge also this recipe must have been shared at all of the west michigan gatherings
i love this salad and have made it for summer bbq39s for years i prefer to mix the cream cheese sugar vanilla and sour cream and then let it set in the fridge over night take it out a little before my family leaves then add the grapes to the mixture and add toppings it seems to just give everything a chance to mesh together i39ve never had a complaint not sure what they used to make it taste like mayo but it sounds like a user error rather then a recipe fail to me
nasty doesn39t taste good unless you put tons of brown sugar on it otherwise it tastes likes grapes with mayonnaise gross my friends hated it what a waste of money
this grape salad is delicious i used green and red grapes in this recipe plus it added some nice color to it this can also be made as a low fat recipe i used fat free sour cream amp cream cheese amp used splenda for sugar 1 cup equals 1 point for weight watchers
the brown sugar needs to be mixed into the salad and there should be more of it 23 stars
this is the best keeps longer than saads made with cool whip does not get watery couldn39t stop eating it
i grew up in jenison hi marge it really is a potluck sort of town this recipe was fantastic since i was making it for my family i halved the recipe the toasted pecans and brown sugar on top were the perfect foil for the tart grapes and cream cheese wow
very good i had no pecans on hand and used sliced almonds
this salvaged my small green grapes that were too tart to enjoy i quartered them and it did not 34water34 down the dressing overnight
i39ve made this many times and even people who are not especially fond of grapes love it it39s always a hit i do however toast the pecans i never liked having to heat up the oven to toast a few nuts and always found the fry pan gave me unreliable results so now i do it in the microwave by melting a generous teaspoon of butter on a microwave safe dish and spreading 14 cup of chopped nuts on it microwave for a minute and stir microwave one more minute and stir in my microwave that39s all the time i need let cool so easy
everyone loved it even the kids i did cut the sugar to 14 c because my grapes were pretty sweet
awesome tasting and very simple to make
very good
this salad is great the only problem is it makes a huge batch
delicious easy to prepare great to take to potlucks
i have been making this for years i freeze 3 milky ways and chop in food processor for add in this is my most requested recipe from her kitchen
easy and delicious
i tasted this salad at a funeral 3 years ago i could not get enough of it i39m so happy to have found the exact recipe here
delish
this sweet salad drew raves at my easter dinnereven though i forgot to add the brown sugar and pecans at the end i add those to my leftovers and i really loved the added texture from the pecans the recipe makes a large amount making it perfect for a potluck i halved the recipe for a my smaller group and still had some left for the next day
my husband39s family has been using this exact recipe for years it39s deceptively good we make it in a 9x13 pan and sprinkle the top with brown sugar and nuts walnuts are great here and pecans also work really well it39s definitely a goto potluck dish in our household never thought about adding chopped up candy bars but i can see how that would be delicious
great ideabut whole grapes are a 39choking39 hazard i never serve whole always cut in half
this makes a huge salad so even for family events i half the recipe very good
everybody loves this salad it39s easy and makes for a great 34bring something34 dish i really like it sans the brown sugar and nuts i think it39s perfect all by itself but the garnish does make it look better i make it at night and let it sit in fridge until the next day make sure grapes are dry before combining
i made this for thanksgiving very delicious
i made this for the first time just because i love grapes my family agreed and it has become a favorite of my grandchildren as well cool refreshing different and not too sweet

when we moved to the south in 2012 this was the first recipe i had to have everyone loves it from kids to adults very refreshing
had this salad a number of years ago at a funeral everybody raved about it didn39t really have a recipe per se so i winged it and it turned out great after reading some of these reviews it39s always left up to a person39s personal tastes the dressing is supposed to be a bit thick so it sticks to the grapes and doesn39t leave a runny mess at the bottom makes for a great salad in the summer on a hot day
this grape salad was fabulous it is fast uses few ingredients and a great taste i made it the night before and it held up well i used sour cream and it gave it a tangy flavor i will make it again
made this to take to a friend it was sooo good and she39s still talking about it
everyone loved this salad i used greek yogurt in place of the sour cream
i have taken this fantastic salad too many gatherings it is a crowd pleaser vicki vail az
i took this to a family reunion today and everybody raved about it and i do mean raved the bowl came back empty and i had offers to lick the bowl this is a winner
everyone loves this recipe for summer i tried a variation i substituted fresh strawberries for the red grapes it was delicious too
we added cool whip to lighten this recipe dressing is too thick
when i have to tweak a recipe i automatically take a star away with that being said this recipe was good and we enjoyed it but it does need the additional brown sugar for me i added a fourth of a cup and everyone loved it i will make it again
my grandkids that don39t like fruit salads loved this thanks you its great
i made this as directed for easter dinner and think the 39dressing39 seems too heavy and twice what is needed if i make it again i would use 3 oz of cream cheese 12 c sour cream and substitute brown sugar for the white sugar and skip sprinkling it over the top i made this according to directions and while it is tasty the dressing is just too thick for my taste
good but not excellent
this is an absolutely fabulous salad i39m guessing i39ve made this at least a dozen times since i got the recipe the summer of 2016 just for fun the other day i added some blueberries and they were so good in there i use it as a dessert when i39m craving something sweet i mix at least a cup or so of chopped walnuts or pecans in instead of sprinkling over the top and i didn39t care so much for the brown sugar so don39t use it at all this is my favorite salad by far wish i could give it ten stars
this is perfect for an office potluck or anytime you need to bring a quick treat to a party the green grapes are perfect for christmas so delicious and addicting note i left off the brown sugar was already sweet enough for me
i enjoy this recipe as a way to use my grapes if they aren39t getting eaten
reminds me of cheesecake i have a new potluck dish now
i mix in heath bar pieces inside when i am mixing in the grapes to the sour cream and cream cheese mixturemy family loves ita little surprise
delicious i have made it for church potlucks as well as picnics at our cabin everyone wants the recipe
i make this recipe but i put it in a 9x13 pan and put the brown sugar and pecans over the top right away i think it is better made the day before serving
delicious a great potluck dish because it39s tasty and different
i39ve been making this for years my recipe has more pecans and brown sugar if you are even thinking about trying it you definitely should it39s delicious take it to a family gathering you will get rave reviews
i have a recipe similar in ingredients to this salad that i got from a friend i haven39t made it yet but my friend puts crushed butterfingers on top of her grape salad it39s really good
made this for a work breakfast didn39t have enough vanilla so i added a tsp of almond extract sweet enough without the brown sugar so i left it off perfect thank you for the recipe
members of my family are diabetic so i eliminated the 13 c sugar and mixed the brown sugar in with the sour cream made a mistake and used 16 oz of low fat sour cream so i didn39t use the cream cheese nevertheless everyone loved it two days later what was left over wasn39t enough for two so i added some fresh raspberries yum now we can39t decide which we like better so i will be making both probably with just the sour cream
so yummy excellent just as written
i am assuming you can make this the day before and then cover and refrigerate
we made this for a picnic and it39s delicious we did leave out the nuts due to a friend with allergies and after tasting it before the nuts and brown sugar finding it sweet enough thats how we left it
made it last night and is still great for breakfast also this same almost exact recipe was on trisha yearwood39s show this morning
made this last night for a ladies gathering and it was well received so simply and so yummy thankswill definitely make again
simply delicious cool and creamy and not too sweet this is a new favorite in my house
wow who would ever thought grapes could taste would be so outstanding as a salad i did not add brown sugar or nuts and still be sowow i look forward to creamy grape saladthank you for this recipe
i have had a similar recipe for years and everyone always wants me to make it for showers and reunions my recipe calls for almond extract and a little brown sugar in the dressing also but is otherwise the same the biggest challenge to me is getting the grapes dry after washing so that the dressing sticks otherwise it just slides off not a cheap dish but certainly tasty and someone always asks for the recipe
this is always a hitwe call it groovy grapes
i made this for a dinner party we had at our house first off for this many grapes at about 2pound cheapest i could find anywhere in february was over 8 in grapes alone not a cheap dish to make when you add up all the ingredients i thought the cream cheese mix was tasty although heavy honestly thought with all the rave reviews that we would be 34wowed34 but in the end not one person of 15 folks kids included mentioned that they liked it i would not make again
had to promise my family i39d make this awesome saladdessert every weekend and i have as of this review i39ve now made it 7 times thanks a bunch for sharing i added the brown sugar to the pan a soon as the pecans toasted stirred them around till the sugar melted and ended up with the best tasting pralines almost forgot one time i had a bit of unsweetened coconut flakes on hand so mixed them in with the creamed mixture must remember to buy some again as it was also delicious
it was just wonderful
i made this recipe for the first time with my teen cooking class at the boys and girls club and the kids absolutely loved it the kids would ask me for this at least once a week so we made it quite a few times thanks for this wonderful recipe
one of my very favorite salad recipes very pretty delicious and easy to make definitely a winner in my book
i have been making this for years and the only tip i can give you isn that u do not need the brown sugar it is just as tasty without it
i have been making this for many years it is always a hit i have my mother39s old betty crocker39s hostess cookbook from 1967 and the recipe is in there we love this
this is a great salad i put praline peacans chopped on top instead of the brown sugar and got rave reviews
i have made this for years and always get rave reviews i prefer it with grapes but have made it with many fruits it is pretty good with blueberries and strawberries on the 4th of july the only thing i do differently is to combine the pecans and the brown sugar and sprinkle it on the salad before i refrigerate it for several hours right before i serve it i give it a final stir to mix it in the brown sugar melts a little bit into the pecans and is not quite as 34grainy34
absolutely amazing and so quick to whip up refreshing salad with great color to compliment any meal tasty with cinnamon crusted pecans crushed on top helpful hint allowing the grapes to dry after rinsing made the cream cheese mixture stick to the grapes much better
love thishave made it in smaller batches too just for me myself and i
this is one of the most delicious salads i have ever made my family loves grapes and with the combination of cream cheese and sour cream it makes it so tasty
i have made this for many years it is always a big hit my grandson who is not fond of fruit absolutely loves this i don39t add the brown sugar it melts too soon into the creamy mixture
delicious the recipe is always requested i left out the brown sugar and yes it can be served as a salad or a dessert depends on the presentation love it
my family found this to be extremely sweet with too much of the cream mixture for the amount of grapes it also seems like more of a dessert than a salad
made with no changes for a potluck it was a hit really good recipe
very delicious i made it for a graduation open house and got lots of requests for the recipe i too used the lower fat cream cheese and sour cream i found that the total amount of brown sugar and nuts was a bit more than really necessary for the presentation in the bowl i used
this was delicious i used lower fat cream cheese and vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream i only used 1 tablespoon of sugar i would definitely recommend this i may even use it for other fruit next time
this recipe is so tasty and refreshing that i add this so my summer entertaining menu and everyone raves about it
i first made this for a cookout after having it at christmas potluck it is really wonderful i found the grape cream mixture ratio was a bit off i find12 to 34 of the creamed mixture is plenty
refreshingly delicious
i have made this the past several years i often omit the brown sugar and pecan topping and substitute crushedbutterfinger candy bars gives it a different taste with the peanut butter and chocolate really good this way
my family loves this salad especially on a warm summer day and the salad is nice and chilled its awesome
i found that a little of this goes a long way as it is somewhat on the sweet side
excellent
fantasic recipes and so good
great i made no changes
my favorite salad of the year5 days later it tastes just as good as the first day had a party of 12 people with a lot of other food had just a third left over i made it the day before to save timefast and easy to make
this is a taste of heaven you can not go wrong with this recipe everyone will love this i eat it as a dessert sometimes just wonderful love it it gets better the next day if it last long enjoy
awesome i take this for pot lucks and everyone always asks for the recipe
the best salad i39ve ever made have sent the recipe many places
made this for thanksgiving it was a huge hit i don39t like pecans so i used toasted almonds instead tasted even better the next day
i used plain greek yogurt instead of sour creamadds protein for same taste i also used less sugar all the way around and plain chopped baking walnuts instead of pecans delicious
i made this salad for our church homecoming and it got rave reviews it is quick to make and has an excellent flavor i will make this again
upon taking this for dinner to share my friend stated something was missing i had forgotten to put brown sugar and nuts on the top what a difference they make
i made this twice in the past several weeks for two different family parties it was a hit at both of them i didn39t use the brown sugarpecan 34topping34 and we still loved it
i made this salad yesterday and took it to a salad supper nothing but rave reviews i came home with an almost empty dish this salad is so good several wanted the recipe definitely a five star recipe i highly recommend this recipe as a volunteer field editor for taste of home
i cut my grapes in half and put the brown sugar and nuts in the mixture i reduced the white sugar and the vanilla to my personal taste i only used about 2 lbs of grapes also you can do anything you want to this recipe and it39s still going to be fabulous great recipe
easy to make and a refreshing new way to eat grapes
great
this was a hit at our church dinner today nothing left to bring home
great summer salad made it for a picnic and it was a hit very easy to make and a refreshing way to enjoy grapes
delicious easy easy to make and just the right amount of sweetness i melted the brown sugar added a little cinnamon and roasted the nuts made a sweet crunchy topping perfect
i have made this for a few years it is delicious everyone i have made it for loves it
in my 39younger39 years waldorf salad was my fav but some years ago i added halved grapes cooked shell noodles and some chopped roasted chicken diced peppers any colori also toasted the pecans before adding them to the saladwhat a wonderful summertime saladcool n refreshing
this is a great recipe i39d always considered that doing anything to grapes except eating them right off the bunch was gilding the lily but after tasting this i decided if you are going to 34gild34 this was the gilding to do i39d never made this myself before today though we had a bunch of white grapes that were just a bit too tart for us to enjoy eating by themselves so i mixed this up it39s so quick and so easy and very forgiving of substitutionsi found that i didn39t have sour cream so used 0 plain greek yogurt and then discovered that i39d accidentally grabbed fat free cream cheese at the store which is a slightly different creature to me than regular or lowfat and i had no pecans so i chopped up some almonds even with all that this came out wonderfully and tasted very similar to what i39ve had in the past at various gatherings
this is one of those recipes that have become a staple at family get togethers everyone loves it i always substitute neufchâtel cheese and fat free sour cream and no one knows the difference
the best ever
delicious easy to make healthier use low fat cream cheese and non fat plain yogurt i used splenda and only 12 of 13 cup and no brown sugar on top also dry roasted almonds instead of sugared nuts
one of our children made it after we had dinner it was a surprise to the entire family we all thought it was delightful i will make it for new years i will only use green grapes because my family are not fond of red grapes and instead of pecans i may use almonds
this is very good
i had never made this salad before i ate it at a picnicdelicious got the recipe and made it the next day tossed in some chopped apples and chopped celery also melted the brown sugar and pecans together and poured over top for a crunchy toffee like topping
good but didn39t think it was as great as the reviews made it out to be probably would have liked it better with less sour cream taste was easy to make
so easy and always a hit
this recipe is so easy and always a hit
this is one of my families favorite fruit salads it39s great for large family gatherings and potluck dinners
great recipe and easy definitely will make again makes a large batch for a potluck

my sisiterinlaw brought this for thanksgiving she used the big purple globe grapes and everyone thought it was some kind of black olive salad boy were we surprised it was fantastic i will be making this the next time i go to a pot luck
hi i havent actually tried this recipe yet but i was wondering if i could made it the day before serving it and let it set in the fridge all night i appreciate any help
i decrease the amount of brown sugar in the topping and add a couple of broken up butterfinger candy bars it is a huge hit
awesome i made this for a party and next time i39ll have to double it everyone wanted seconds
so simple and everyone loves it i toast the pecans for a richer crispier taste
awesome recipe my motherinlaw first made this recipe and now i can39t get enough of it we don39t always use the pecans due to my nephew being allergic this is a keeper recipe
i get rave reviews every time i bring this dish to a picnic or dinner kids and adults love it
if you have friends over and serve this a good word of advice 34make copies of the recipe34

this has become our traditional salad for cookouts and even thanksgiving i add a couple of delicious apples with the mixgreat
my sister raved about this and made it for me to try it was wonderful she even used fat free sour cream and low fat cream cheese to cut down on the fat in it and that made absolutely no difference in it it was just delicious
if i do ever make this again i would cut the cream cheese mixture in half
this is a delicious recipe it is a great summer treat very addictive
everyone looked at it funny and then had seconds a winner
try toasted coconut with brown sugarpecan mixturetook it to a halloween party and called it hairy eyeballsa big hit
have been making this salad for years since i saw it in the bowling green city paper we love it easy to make and delicious i use splenda instead of sugar to cut down on calories also use the splenda blend brown sugar
it was very tastyeveryone loved it i used light sour cream and light cream cheese substituted splenda for the sugar next time i think i will add some apple strawberries and blueberries
i have made this salad many times for holiday dinners and have taken it to potluck dinners as well i always get asked for the recipeso good i could almost eat the whole bowl myself
this is always a hit with our family someone makes it for every gathering
this salad is always a hit i also use 2 butterfinger candy bars and 14 c of brown sugar for the topping also you can make it the night before
took this to our pig roast and it was all gone the flavor is great
a delicious change to any meal especially take to potlucks
i have been making this recipe for years and we love it my kids have affectionately renamed it 34eyeball salad34 since in a clear bowl that39s what it kind of looks like i put the nuts and brown sugar on top several hours before serving and it starts to carmelize on top and makes it even better i also increase the brown sugar on top
i do not put the brown sugar on top it gives it a gritty taste that my family does not like i put it in the sour cream
this is a great salad the 1st time i made it family was unsure but at the end of the day nothing was left and i have to make it almost all the time now for everything
always a hit i use powdered sugar instead of granular i think it mixes in better
i have made this several times and our grandchildren love this salad and think it is a wonderful treat
i had this at a baby shower and loved it i have shared the recipe with many others and have made several times and always get rave reviews
i had this at a pot luck at work and a coworker refused to give me the recipe only thing different is she used crushed butterfingers on top and it was awesome thanks for the recipe
divide by 8 and round up or down depending if u want leftoverszach
yummy everyone loved it
i only need about 4 servings of this do you have the breakdowns for just this many
i added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture it was great
i have had this with splenda and it39s just as good also have used almond instead of vanilla for a stronger flavor
i was worried the peanut butter cups would make this sweeter than i could handle so i swapped out the cups for crushed nutter butter cookies and a tiny sprinkling of kosher salt wowww highly recommend
this recipe has everything a person with a sweet tooth probably loves peanut butter cups pudding whipped topping and oreos i don39t usually like peanut butter in things except a sandwich but for this delectable dessert i changed my mind
made this dessert for a potluck my husband and i attended and everyone absolutely loved it i will definitely make it again
can i freeze this desert
my husband and i and our two guests absolutely loved this dessert the only change i made was to add 12 cup of confectioner39s sugar to the cream cheese and omit it from the pudding mix as per another39s review it was perfect will make often
i know already commented on this recipe years ago but a lady i even know just refound it the recipe for me i could not find this for the life of me and so thankful it was found for me by a kind incredible personif you made this time especially now with holidays fully upon usyou will be so glad you did as will the friendsfolksfamily who are delving into lusciousness
love love this recipe when i bring it to potlucks people always ask for the recipe
our soninlaw loves anything peanut butterthis one is a keeper delicious and easy to put together i keep the ingredients on hand for this one
this is a fantastic dessert i actually freeze it so i can enjoy it longer
this is such a good dessert and so easy to put together great for summer
a staff favourite at our parties it is always requested thanks for sharing the recipe
thank you debbie for sharing your recipe it is amazing very easy to put together made it to give friends they absolutely love it i used about 34 cup of peanut butter just because i wanted to empty the jar great recipe
not sure what everyone is raving about my family didn39t like this at all way to sweet and the instant pudding is just weird
absolutely heavenly left out the peanut butter cups might have been overkill it was a hit
really nice cake you have really done a nice job as you have shared the best things for me even this recipes can be made in busy time also it39s really special for me thanks for sharing it here on this sitehttpcakedeliveryingurgaonhttpcakedeliveryindelhihttpcakedeliveryinnoidahttpcakedeliveryinkota
i made this without any of the confectioner sugar and it was amazing my family loved it
made it for a work celebration it was the first dessert gone
yummy rich smooth flavor leftovers didn39t last long
there are really good desserts then there are great desserts this one falls under great desserts it39s rich and smooth with a variety of flavors and textures that marry together for a party in your mouth a hard to earn 5 stars from me
sounds delicious right now and i39m loving it and i39m looking forward to making it some day
the first time i made this my family and i was super impressed and it has become the most requested dessert for sunday dinners
this was a big hit as a volunteer field editor for toh i enjoy testing new recipes as others have suggested it is very rich and a small serving goes a long way very simple to make and a crowd favourite for sure
delicious but very rich could reduce the amount of confectioners sugar and it would still be sweet enough a 934x1334 pan is not big enough for a doubled recipe
i have made this several times took it to work to share and even the people who said they only wanted a little bit came back for big second helpings delish
so rich so sweet a little dab will do you impressive to take to parties
this was very good i placed this in a 9 x 13 pan i just needed to crush up a few more oreos for the crust to fill the bottom of the pan i normally don39t adjust recipes prior to making them the first time but several people commented about the sweetness of this dessert so i only added 12 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheesepeanut butter mixture and none to the chocolate pudding this was perfect for us everyone at the party loved it i39d definately make it again
excellent dessert i actually had someone who doesn39t like sweets say that he loved this recipe because of the peanut butter taste it is really sweet but that39s the point anything that puts chocolate and peanut butter together is going to taste great i used lowfat nofat items where i could but no one would know
delicious dessert i used the new peanut butter filled oreos for the base and to sprinkle on top and that really put it over the top i also found a big jar of truly miniature peanut butter cups about the size of a large chocolate chip at our local mennonite store and used those rather than chopping up peanut butter cups a wonderful cool treat on a very hot summer day
this is really flippin good i kno i will make and be asked to make it againits super crazy sweet tho i will leave the powdered sugar out altogether in the future i put about a cup in with the cream cheese only bc i had sugar free pb its still borderline too sweet thowe used the butterfinger bits instead of the reeses tooand a little tip for the oreos i used an already made oreo pie crust for that it holds together better to spread the cream chesse on top i just dumped it in the bottom of the casserole dish i used and sorta smashed it down to cover the whole bottomstill ridiculously good for 10 mins of work
i made this for a family get together and everyone loved it will definitely make again
this is delicious this is the second time i have made it for two groups of people and it has been loved by everyone this will stay in my dessert rotation for sure
i made this yesterday to take to work todayi really enjoyed making this as it was as many have said very easy one thing i was follow the recipe to a t when i read the ingredients it sounded way too sweet it was going to have a cloying affect reading all the reviews i found others thought so too after they had made it decided to cut the powdered sugar in half didn39t add powdered sugar to the pudding either also a change i made was to cut some of the sweetness by adding some creme fresh to the cream cheese another thing i did was melted the butter and i broke up the cookies more fine like a pie crust i knew if i added the melted butter to the cookie crumbs i39d be able to pat it better into the bottom of my container i put it in the refrigerator overnight because i plan on serving this to my coworkers for the next few days also omitted putting the cookie chunks andor the mini peanut butter cups on top because i didn39t know how well it would travel on a plane and the top treats would just get squashed plus seemed like overkillmy husband was able to just have one bite last night and a small bite at that because his stomach was on fire from mexican restaurant we went to for dinner he did say this was very good i actually think i39ll make this several more times i wish i would39ve known about it last weekend at our 3yr old39s birthday party but i didn39t all in all i think this is a hitdinged a point because of original recipe being too sweet for our taste as written plus additionsampsubtractionspsupdate july 1stmade it again yesterday for a neighbor who is having a 1st time swimpool filling up party tonight i use the 59oz pudding mix because i want to make it a large dessert for this us celebration weekend party i crushed 39chocolate colored rock candy39 on top for color from winco bulk dept i won39t be here for the party tonight but hope it will be enjoyed ask if you care to know how i changed this recipe to suit our tastes happy to oblige
these are the best and decious tins i have ever made
i made this for my sister and brother in law39s birthday he likes anything that39s peanut butter and chocolate i found it very easy to make it was a little tricky getting the oreos on the bottom i think next time i would omit the butter and just sprinkle them in the pan i used fat free cream cheese and light cool whip still came out great my brother in law thought it was very rich but i thought it was perfect
everyone loved this i will definitely be making this again
made this one year for our family christmas was a big hit but oh so rich you won39t need much of it at one time but oh so delicious
this was delicious anyone have problem with oreo crust not sticking
i opted for a 9x13 pan and totally happy with the result i used a few more cookies for bottom crust to insure coverage all finished the dessert fills the pan to within 1434 of top edge
love love my family loved it
mine is currently in the fridge setting right now so i haven39t even eaten it yet except for a few tastes here and there but so far it39s delicious while prepping this i popped my unwrapped peanut butter cups in the freezer while i worked on step 3 that way they were firm and easier to chop
omg this is wonderful served it for a family dinner and it was a huge hit will make often
absolutely decadent next time i would combine the pudding with the powdered sugar before adding the milk to prevent clumping and used maybe a little bigger pan as mine was overflowing
made this for my grandson age 22 and he loved it popped the remainder in the freezer just to see what would happen and it froze very well now i can have it on hand whenever he stops by and is craving some chocolate
wow this was simple delicious and a huge hit at work i added extra peanut butter cups to the top because there can never be enough
i did not find it to sweet being that i have made many other desserts that had way to much sugari think the pudding helps i will make it again
the only thing wrong with this is its too awesome i can39t quit eating it
i love this recipe i made it for my husband to take to a work dessert contest and won first place i39m diabetic so i tweaked the recipe a little to make it a little lower in sugar i use light whipped topping and sugar free pudding
i made this for our son39s birthday he loves peanut butter cups and he loved this dessert everyone loved it it is rich but oh so good
everyone could not stop talking about how amazing this was
very easy and so delicious
yummy very rich amp flavorful will definitely make again i used extra peanut butter cups on top about 10 chopped to make it look like the picture i took it to a cookout and it was a hit
great but pretty rich and too sweet
excellent dessert i39ve made this dessert twice now and everyone loves it love love love
excellent dish i froze it to make sure it didn39t get soggy also used half the sugar was still plenty sweet will surely make again perhaps with chunky peanut butter
loved it
too rich and it got soggy fast won39t make again
so good really rich though
yummm sooo delicious it is pretty rich so i couldn39t eat too big off a piece but it was amazing if you like peanut butter and chocolate together this recipe is for you
this was the best combination of chocolate and peanut butter i have had
this was amazing i made it for my boyfriends birthday and then for christmas eve everyone loved itone of the complaints was that it was too sweet i made it with sugar free cool whip and chocolate pudding and light pb it was not to rich just do not use light or reduced fat cream cheese because it changes the consistency
my sister made this and shared with us if you like rich desert this is the desert for you we loved it and i definitely added it to my favorite desert recipes
i was impressed i served it when we had some friends over and everyone couldn39t get over how good it was even the picky toddler ate it who usually won39t even eat dessert
this dessert is awesome
great recipe
surprisingly not a hit with the group of teen guys i fed it to i think it was too mushy not enough substance i make a similar trifle dish but with much more brownies to make it more cake like too much trouble and not even one person said they liked it
5 stars i made this for christmas dinner and my son raved about it it is his new favorite dessert and has requested it for any future gathering that we have
wow this was really tasty it is extremely filling so a little goes quite a long way we used more oreos than the package called for because i wanted them to fill the bottom of the pan this was fun to make with the kids and everyone absolutely loved it i will absolutely make this again for a party
all i can say iswow this dessert is absolutely one of the best i have ever had so easy because you don39t even have to bake it it was a huge hit i do have to add that i accidentally bought an 8 oz container of whipped topping misread the recipe and i almost panicked but since i didn39t discover it until too l ate i had no choice but to just split that one as far as i know it worked out fine i am wondering now if it39s better this way
this is absolutely the best dessert since i have found the recipe just a month or so ago i have made it 3 times everyone just went crazy over it so simple to make this is my new dessert to make and take to anywhere just fyi i made it in an 11 x 9 pan next time i will double the crust wouldn39t hurt to double the crust anyway
need to bring this to work has anybody tried to do this in cupcake papers or small cups to make serving easier thank you
this recipe is sickenly sweet way too rich
a little too sweetrich for our taste but it is good

got rave reviews at easter when i served this was the best dessert i have had in a long time
excellent dessert my fiance absolutely loved it and has already asked if i can make it again i used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy as well and it turned out really well it was a nice way to put that much needed crunch in the middle of all the deliscious creamyness it a winner in this house and will certainly be used again thank you
i was a little intimidated by this recipe at first but it turned out beautifully to make it easier to crush the cookies i put them in the fridge to get cold then placed in a sandwich bagand using a mallet pounded the cookies till they were crushed i also placed the peanut butter cups in the fridge to make cutting them easier everyone loved this recipe and i make it as the recipe states the presentation was awesome

i made this dessert on memorial day and for a family dinner yesterday it was thoroughly enjoyed both times the recipe is easy to put together and comes in handy on hot summer days no baking required the first time i made it i didn39t put the whipped topping in the peanut butter and cream cheese layer and it still turned out great i suggest using a dish larger than 934 square and adding more crushed cookies for the crust
made it for fathers day and everyone loved it was not hard to make did not find it over rich i did add more peanut butter cups would make it again
i happened to have oreo cookies with green mint filling and used this for the recipe it was delicious
very rich but oh so tasty
this recipe takes a little time to do each layer has it39s own 34prep work34but it is worth the effort my family loved this nobake very rich dessert
it was rich but very good i made it for a summer holiday dinner and it was a big hit
the results are fabulous but i disagree with the submitter that it39s 34a cinch to whip up because there39s no baking involved34 4 bowls two washes of the beaters letting things set up etc i could have whipped up a fantastic batch of brownies which are baked in about the same amount of time or less actually just because you don39t have to bake it doesn39t mean it39s a cinch
absolutely beautifulgushing with flavour and such a strong taste of beauty
very rich but delicious my family loved it
for spellcheck technically you would do 1 12 recipe for a 9x13 pan but for ease of making just double everything it makes it a bit thicker but oh so yummy
fantastic everyone loved it one small thing i would change is to omit the 12 cup of confectioners sugar in the pudding layer it39s plenty sweet alreadyfor the reviewer whose pudding layer didn39t set up don39t forget to let the pudding stand until softset i put mine into the refrigerator for this stepfor the reviewer asking whether to leave the cream on the cookies yes leave it on
this got rave reviews when i served it to friends so rich creamy and delicious have a glass of milk handy when you eat it it39s amazing
this came out fantastic made it for my inlaw39s birthday and the entire family gobbled it up d next time i want to try freezing it though it was very good right out of the fridge
fabulous anyone know how to convert the ingredients to fit a 9 x 13 pan
yes crush the whole cream filled chocolate cookies you39ll have delicious black and white crumbs for the crust
a big hit especially for peanut butter lovers
would someone please tell me if you leave the cream on the chocolate cookies when you crush them thank you
wonderful i make a 34makeover34 version of this would love to know the new nutrition facts it39s still bad for you but not as bad 1 tbsp butter 12 to 34 cup confect sugar mixed with the cr cheese and pb no sugar added to pudding mix made with skim milk use light whipped topping still decadent
amazing best combination ever i can39t wait to try this recipe you are a genius thank you for sharing
out of this world easy to make and it was a big hit will make it again but will double the recipesrich but delicious
one of faith39s faves
made this for a christmas family gathering and everyone loved it i took an empty dish home
this was awsome the taste of peanut butter was soooo good thanks again
this is one of the best desserts i have ever had everyone always requests me to make this for all of our familyfriend39s gettogethers i would suggest buying the bag of mini reese39s peanut butter cups to save time on unwrapping and chopping the larger peanut butter cups
so delicious this dessert is easy to make and it is such a nice alternative to the typical dessert of cookies or cake it is so thick and rich that you don39t need a lot of it to feel satisfied so it feeds a lot of people the best part is that it39s easy to make healthier by using reducedfat oreos cream cheese peanut butter whipped topping and milk cannot wait to make this dessert again
simple and what is there not to love about chocolate and peanut butter very rich and so very delicious
this was a excellant dessert and a total hit with myself and family
but my pudding layer did not set it was runny i left it off
this is lucious made it for teachers for a dinner and everyone raved over it none left
my husband is the big sweet eater in the family and he is picky about his food he gave this 5 stars all the way
i have not made this yet but wanted to know if you use chocolate cream cookies or oreo39s i want to try to make it for a dinner soon amp was just wondering what others use thanks for the recipe it sounds amp looks so yummy
i first made this dessert when i found it in the taste of home several years ago it was fantastic and a huge hit with the family i get requests for it from family when we are getting together to celebrate
marilyn linn in recipes like this do not remove the cream filling but make sure you crush the cookies as finely as possible so they make a better crust enjoy
this is a great dessert our family has made it many times for special gatherings
please tell me if one is supposed to remove the cream filling from the cookies before crushing them
i have made this dessert many times for friends and family everyone enjoys and always wants seconds i have also modified it into just a peanut butter pie its quick and easy and very delicious
really good recipe everyone really enjoyed it and it does taste even better frozen
i purchased the 2009 edition oftaste of home prize winning recipes at the beach i continue to use the recipes in this magazine on a regular basis the peanut butter chocolate dessert recipe is to die for and yes i will make it again and again
making this for a second time in two weeks this dessert is fabulous and definitely better frozen just holds together better and resembles icecream cake in a way the first night that i made this a family member requested that i bring this to their next birthday event
i used a 9x13 dish so i added a little extra of everything very yummy i served frozen
this dessert was much better frozen
greatnext time i39m going to try freezing it and taking in out 15 min before
just great i made in a nine inch pan so added just about 4 more oreo39s and 5 more peanut buter minatures it was a hit bluemistglowssnetnet a little more time consuming but worth the time for such good flavor bluemistglowssnetnet susan from connecticut
i made this for the first time about 5 years agoevery time i39ve made it i never have any leftovers
this was an instant favorite instead of the cookie crust i broke up some leftover brownies i also layered mine in a clear glass bowl alternating each layer at least twiceit just dressed it up a little and added some eyeappeal
this recipe always gets compliments when i make it for company i usually use the lower fat neufchatel cream cheese and it turns out great i39ve also made this recipe using the smaller container of whipped topping for a denser consistency both ways work fine great recipe
this is a hit i double for a 9x13 pan and used whipped real whipping cream with no sugar instead of coolwhip
everyone at work went crazy for this it is delicious and very richwill definitely make it again
i absolutely love the marriage between chocolate and peanut butter so when i saw this i had to make it it was so good that my friend and i ate it until we were insanely full and didn39t feel good anymore so the amount this recipe calls forgoes a long way for a lot of guests since its so rick also crush your cookies very well use more butter and melt it so that your crust remains in tack excellent im making it again tonight for a company bbq
this was heaven yum
added carrots and potatoes beef broth in place of water plus thickened liquid with corn starch to complete the meal this has been a family favorite for years
i used 1 bottom round roast put carrots and potatoes under roast and used 1 quart of beef broth instead of water on low for 8 hours then thickened it with corn starch amazing although the gravy is so delicious it would be even better on mashed potatoes
sounds like time for a sub roll or something similar and french dip sandwiches yum
i39ve made this dozens of times and it39s so delicious the chuck roast comes out perfecttender and juicy and the sauce is scrumptious
i am the 75 years young chief cook and bottle washer in our home i made this recipe exactly as posted and it was deliciious juicy and tender i put the juices in a small pan and thickened the gravy with 2 tbs flour whisked in 12 cup water and served it with mashed potatoes and green beans i got rave reviews from my wife of 50 years love your recipes keep up the great work
i though this pot roast was excellent after its cooked i shred it up and thicken the juices with some cornstarch then add the meat back into the juice very yummy
this is a very tasty recipe i agree with the previous poster make sure you use the amount of meat or it will be salty there has been times where i omitted the italian dressing just using the gravy mix and the ranch dressing is still very flavorful
to tsuop this is delicious nowhere does the contributor say it is 34home made34 if you can39t say anything nice find a 34home made34 recipe and move on
we love this recipe made it several times many times just for the two of us so plenty of leftovers i always double the gravy mixture so there is plenty for potatoes yummy
easy tasty recipe many reviewers found it too salty i wonder if they are only using one roast i used two roasts totaling about 6 pounds the flavor reminded me of a french dip i plan to shred the second roast make some tasty homemade bread add some swiss cheese and use the remaining broth as french dip or perhaps do an open faced sandwich yum
tried this on sunday and it was delicious the meat melted in your mouth and it had so much flavor i did however first season the roast with meat tenderizer salt pepper garlic powder and then browned it in olive oil and the put in the crockpot then poured the mixture in the fry pan scrapping up the browned bits from the bottom poured over the meat and added another 14 cup of water cooked for 412 hrs and it was falling apart so tender will definitely make again
made according to recipe and we found it extremely spicy and salty not sure what happened here as i can see all the 5 star reviews glad everyone else enjoyed it
we love this recipe easy and great taste
very tasty and very easy to make
made this in the crock pot last sunday yummy this will be my go to recipe very easy to make
absolutely delicious and so very easy to make the only change i made was to use two small arm roasts that i had on hand rather than chuck roast the gravy was delicious i will definitely be making this my goto pot roast recipe from now on
so easy and the best tasting ever whole family loves this one
this is a super recipe since it39s just the two of us i used just one roast i also omitted the ranch dressing mix because we despise the flavor
delicious recipe very easy to prepare i used 3 cups of water rather than me 12 cup in the recipe it was not salty good night
this is the first recipe review i have ever given and this recipe deserves all the accolades it can possibly get i am not even a big meat eater but i have made this pot roast twice in the past month i hate salty food and i didn39t find this this salty at all i only made one roast and slid a few chopped up potatoes carrots onions and garlic cloves under it to make it all fit in my 4 quart crockpot i also added 14 cup of water to the recipe because i love the gravy my family likes the beef which totally falls apart and potatoes while i favor the gravy and carrots we all enjoy it over rice pilaf it smells so good while its simmering merrily in the crockpot try it tonight
i didn39t change a thing my family loved it very flavorful and fall apart tender
i39ve been making this recipe for twenty years i only use one boneless chuck roast and put potatoes and carrot chunks under it and cook at 325 in the oven in my covered dutch oven for about two and a half hours i also use a bit more water to make sure i have enough of the gravy
this has become a favorite i like to put fresh mushrooms andor green beans under the roast and wow this recipe also works beautifully with pork butt
one of my favorite recipes but i also add a stick of butter superb
this is my favorite pot roast i39ve been making it for years and it is always very good i sometimes just buy stew meat add some potatoes and carrots and do the same thing
salty but perfect over mashed potatoes will definitely be making this again
it is very flavorful but also very salty i like things a little salty and this was too salty for me
i made some mashed potatoes and served the meat over the potatoes and there were no leftovers i used beef stock instead of water and this was the most flavorful roast i39ve ever had definitely making it again
i made this a week ago and felt i should like it since i39ve heard so much about this type of roast i used this recipe which except i added the pepperoncini as the recipe for mississippi pot roast uses it was just average was hoping to rave about it but can39t won39t make this again
the finish product was delicious but i only used half of the packages i served it with mashed potatoes and corn fritters
family favorite my daughter first made this amp we thought it too salty too so she recommended when i make it add 12 packets of ranch amp italian dressing mix amp use lower sodium gravy mix i do amp that helps lower sodium very easy tasty
did a 2 12 pot roast with half the mixes and turned out perfect only there much gravy and i added 2 c water and add beef bouillon to make up for it so it as tasty as it could have been i served the gravy over the roast and mashed potatoes my husband is a chef and he said the roast was amazing and moist i will make this from now on but will make sure to make the gravy to match
loved this recipe the only thing that i changed was i substituted with 32 oz of beef broth and added diced golden potatoes with carrots excellent recipe
we did not like this at all it was too salty from all the packaged mixes i will not be making this again
my family has enjoyed this dish for years now everyone loves this meal
carolbrummett then tweek the recipe to suite your taste buds and yes these recipes are by real cooks have a nice day
this was really flavorful and quick to prepare and put in crockpot
delicious as written but beef broth iof water even more flavorful
this was very good might add 1 cup of beef broth low sodium next time instead of water to give it a little more beef flavor also added carrots amp potatoes on top and made gravy with left over juices for a complete meal
this was really good i only used one roast
the best pot roast ever have made this many times and you can39t beat it for easy and sooooo tasty
taste of home use to be real recipes by real cooks this recipe is terrible it39s full of prepackaged fake ingredients artificial colors artificial flavors preservatives way too much salt and is very unhealthy do not feed this recipe to your family cook real food
excellent i added baby potatoes portabella and button mushrooms for the last 4 hours
excellent
flavorful
my kind of crock pot recipe quick and easy smelled so yummy and the meat just fell apart served with mashed potatoes and hubby put the extra gravy on everything
just a great and easy recipe we have a large family and this christmas will be the third time i39ve made this wonderful entree thank you
my wife made this the other night and we all loved it she doubled the ingredients because she added vegetables to it its a keeper for us well make again
i too was a little skeptical about the mixes but this pot roast recipe is wonderful it was tender juicy and absolutely delicious a keeper
move over lipton onion soup mix recipe
so easywonderful flavor gravy was great over mashed potatoes
family favorite
very flavorful i use 14 wine and 14 cup of beef broth in place of the wateri have also used onion soup mix instead of the brown gravy mix
my absolute favorite roast recipe i have made this so many times i usually remove the roast at the end and add cornstarchwater to make gravy
this was very good and gave great flavor to a very large roast will make again
amazing we loved this dish and it was so easy to make i used about 3 lbs of pork roast and chuck roast my mom swears by combining both roasts in a pan i cooked them in a dutch oven in the oven for an hour at 375 then for about 3 more hours at 300 the meat was so tender and flavorful i will definitely make this again soon
i used canned beef gravy and it was delicious i read the shopping list wrong so i went for it
loved the flavor but it was toooooo salty
not sure why but we just didn39t like the flavor of this it does make a lot of gravy so i understand why mashed potatoes are the suggested side i added carrots and potatoes to the crock pot and the flavors just didn39t work well together
my husband absolutely loves roast this way his absolute favorite and mine as well since it is so easy
yummy
this is handsdown the best roast recipe i have tried it is simple easy and full of flavor just the memory of it will make your mouth water
i just made this for sunday dinner it was really good i put my roast in the oven on 350 degrees for about 35 to 4 hoursi came out great i removed the roast the last 15 hours sliced it added some cornstarch to the gravy prior to serving with some homemade mashed potatoes this is delicious i would definitely make this again
very easy and flavorful i added a few carrots in the bottom of the slow cooker and served it with the gravy amp mashed potaotes hubby thought it was a keeper and so did i
i have made this several times i use one larger roast instead of two smaller ones i also put onions green peppers and mushrooms in
i changed up the seasoning a little based on what i had in the pantry i used 1 packet of mushroom gravy mix 1 pack of ranch seasoning and 1 packet of lipton39s onion mushroom soup mix i also added potatoes carrots celery and onion on top of the roast it was fantastic i will definitely be making it again it was so easy and it tastes delicious
great flavor moist meat easy to make has become a family favorite
the best roast i have ever had i have made it 3 times now i did have to adjust the ingredients for 2 and it is still wonderful
delicious enjoyed by the whole family i added onion mushrooms and potatoes gravy was phenomenal
family loved it
taste great but only cooked chuck roast for 5 hours on low
amazing i used only one chuck roast since there39s only 2 of us and omitted the ranch just because i was a cheapskate at the store definitely worth making theresa
this was so easy and tasted pretty good although it seemed a little too salty i too put potatoes carrots and some onion on the bottom
this pot raost was amazing it was so tender and flavorful i also thickened the juices to make the gravy my family of 4 was sad to find out there wasn39t enough for seconds i will double the amount of chuck roast next time for sure so there is enough for seconds i added carrots potatos and onion to mine mm mm mmmmm
very good a little on the tangy side from the italian dressing which i enjoy but if you have family members who do not just use a half a packet or less of italian dressing i usually uuse a 4 pound roast so i just do two of ranch 2 of brown gravy and 1 of italian dressing in a cup of water when i thinken the juices for gravy i just add some corn starch or flour to some cold waterbefore i mixit in to the juices to avoid lumps the best part is it is so easy yet tastes so good
my family said this was the best roast i have ever made i used a 35 lb roast and layered onions carrots and new potatoes cut in half underneath the meat for me it took the full cooking time
one of our favorite recipes
i sprinkled the roast with salt and pepper then rolled in flour and put on top of carrots onion and a potato and let sit on low for 10 hours great recipe
love this recipe i add potatoes on the bottom of the slow cooker and then chopped onions and whole baby carrots i use two of each dressing mix and gravy mix and pour on top of all the beef carrots and potatoes and let it cook for 810 hrs this makes a quick and easy sunday dinner
this is one of my goto recipes the flavor is awesome
so easy and delicious the meat was incredibly tender i didn39t have brown gravy mix so i just stirred beef bullion and cornstarch into the water
so easy and delicious the meat was incredibly tender i didn39t have brown gravy mix so i just stirred beef bullion and cornstarch into the water
fantastic and easyi almost got the wrong size brown gravy envelopegot the smaller one and threw vegetables in and everything was fine i don39t like salty and it wasn39t
so disappointing not good at all threw it all out
nice
i didn39t have dry salad dressing envelopes in the pantry so i used bottled zesty italian and ranch dressing about 12 cup apiece with a jar of savory beef gravy carrots in the pot with it and about six and a half hours cook time only did one potroast of about 3 lbs just delicious and enough gravy to throw over rice great recipe
how old was your dog
made it tonight and everyone loved it it39s easy didnt over or undercook and tasted great i added some carrots and potatoes about 4 hrs into it then from the suggestion of another member added cornstarch to thicken the liquid to use as gravy
great pot roast recipe pot roast is not usually a favorite with my husband amp i but this recipe really appealed to us hubby kept complimenting me all night very tender juicy amp tasty i cooked it with potatoes onions amp carrots i also used bit more water about 34 cup brought back memories of my mom39s pot roast when she made it in a pressure cooker
let me get this straight you use 3 packages of mixes but only 12 cup of water that just makes a paste right it does not seem like that is enough fluid
seasonings overpowered the taste of the roast
this recipe is an absolute keeper i39ve made it many times since i found it on the website and it39s a huge family favorite
the whole family loved this one
the family loved this will make again
this recipe definitely lives up to its name however i39d like to try it with sirloin tips next time i did add a normandy veggie mix to this towards the end of cooking i served it with loaded mashed potatoes and the fam loved it
the flavor was very very good but i over cooked it 6 hours in my slow cooker was to long would have been very yummy with mashed potatoes
popnminyes you can add vegetable to this recipewhen i make it i add the vegetables on the bottom and then the roastthis also makes a good gravyto thicken it up some up can add a little cornstratch to some water and add it
very easy recipe i make regularly for my family i add a bag of carrots and make sure to make mashed potatoes for this one
this had a good flavour but using pkg dressing mixes not a good idea as i read the ingr and has way too much sodium and chemicals not good for you better to go make your own route
this is delicious i made this for some picky company and they even asked for the recipe
i made this the first time for company an they loved it lol even took some to work cold a keeper
my whole family loves this recipe i make it at least once a month i add either baby carrots or chunks of carrots to itthat39s my favorite part i let the carrots cook the entire popnmimyou can add potatoes too but i prefer to make creamed potatoes to go with it
i am an old man learning to cook for myself and wife don39t know much and depend on taste of home to keep me straightcan you add vegetables to this when and how many
one of the best pot roast i have made and will make again from now on
amazing flavor and so easy the only roast recipe for my family from now on
amazing my whole family loved this recipe from now on i won39t be making my roast any other way sooo good
we have made this over and over again my husband pulls it with a fork when it is done one of the easiest recipes and one of the best i even purchased ranch dip mix by accident and it39s just as good
one of my favorites to make when serving a pot roast
i agree with carrie i won39t make roast any other way i cut the recipe in half for my family and save the other half of the dressing and sauce mixes in a ziploc bag so they39ll be ready for the next time
although this is delicious just the way it39s shown i find we like it even better with a can of cream of mushroom soup stirred into the sauce this increases the gravy and gives it a nice creamy texture it has a delicious flavor prepared this way
easy and tasty this is a truly amazing recipe my only complaint is that there wasn39t enough
truly excellent i will not make a roast any other way now i do up the water to one cup so there is more gravy
this was super easy flavorful and tender
it was delicious and my boyfriend just asked me to make it again for the 3rd timei was afraid to try the vegetables due to the comments but i39m going to try them and see how they come out after the last comment said they were fine
even though some reviewers said it was too salty i decided to make it as it was written fyi the env of ranch dressing mix i used was 1 oz the env of italian salad dressing mix was 07 oz and the env of brown gravy mix was 087 oz the brands i used are well known after pouring the mixure over the meat i added cut potates and carrots on top many reviewers suggested adding these vegetables it came out perfect and not salty at all my husband rated it excellent
so easy and so delicious
amazing is all i have to say i just used a large 5 lb roast instead of the 2 smaller ones i also threw it in the crock pot frozen and put it on high for about an hour and then down to low for 6 hours and it was great and don39t forget about the gravy it makes wow and all of our dinner guests 5 people loved it too
very good roast but mine was very salty i don39t know which of the powdered mixes made it so salty but other then that is was very flavorful i think the brown gravy mix may have been the culprit
it was good but very salty won39t make it this way again because of the sodium content not because of the flavor
oh yes makes sunday dinner a breeze i added carrot chunks to make it a full dinner with mashed potatoes the only criticism i have is the gravy needs to be thicker maybe adding a tablespoon or so of cornstarch the last half hour would do it love this easy recipe
very very good even my mother in law who is a very tough critic loved it
absolutely delicious flavor and so tender it practically melts in your mouth definitely a winner
roast beef can some times be boring but not this recipe excellent
this was amazing i will only make pot roast this way from now on
so easy and truly excellent my 3 year old asked for 3rd helpings and my husband told me it was the best meat he has ever eaten i can honestly say i don39t think i would make a pot roast any other way after this i did up the water to one cup for more gravy delicious
we enjoyed this recipe as written the first few times i made it last time i added a can of cream of mushroom soup and it was even tastier it adds flavor and makes a creamier gravy
excellent and simple recipe i also added potatoes and carrots to make it a complete dinner my husband loved it and is already requesting it again
i made this once and now my family wants this all the time it is wonderful a must try thank you for this recipe
my husband still hasn39t stopped talking about how great this is i only cooked 1 roast and my husband had 34 of it by himself one of my sons had the other 14 and the 2nd son daughter amp i had none since there was none left usually roast sits in the fridge for days leftover so i expected the same result not with this recipe i may have to buy a couple more crockpots to keep up with the demand
i39m not a big meateater but this roast was fabulous i used a three pound roast and threw in carrots celery potatoes onions and mushrooms the roast was extremely tender and juicy i can39t wait to make it again
excellent recipe this was so delicious i kept forgetting to buy the ranch mix at the store so i just used more italian with the gravy and it was still great next time i will try it with the ranch
made this last night and all i can say is yummy served it with mashed potatoes and what a meal even my picky eater loved it this is definitely a keeper
this was very flavorful one of the best pot roasts we ever had added carrot potatoes and some onion next time will thicken the juices some
so simple and yet so tasty i39ll make this again and again
wonderful recipe
i am making this for the 2nd time love it love it love it simple but wonderful
i have tried pot roast several times over the years the dogs usually enjoy it to bad there was none left for them this time this was excellent i will be making this again
i39ve been making this recipe for years i found the recipe in a newspaper grocery circular and shared it with family and friends many times and we all love it
served this to guests and everyone raved about it i served it with boiled red potatoes and a saladenough saida great complete meal
i have a smaller crockpot so just used a 3 lb roast added new potatoescelerybaby carrots amp onions delicious and i39m just learning to cook but husband amp i both agree this is a definite keeper
super easy to make and great taste i did add some vegetables to mine and they came out very salty i guess that39s why this recipe does not call for any vegetables the meat was perfect not too salty
this is a super easy recipe and now is my family39s favorite potroast
this recipe is so flavorful i have made thisseveral times alreadyi have added potatoesand carrots at the beginning of cooking
incredibly simply and tastes amazing
i have never been much on beef roast i just didn39t like the taste of it the only use i had for a beef roast was to cook and shred it to make vegetable soup i have to admit the combination of the dressings just didn39t sound like they went with roast but after reading all the reviews i wanted to try it boy am i glad i did i was still skeptical even as i mixed the packets together to pour over the meat but one taste put all skepticism to rest i made gravy from the juices and it was delicious i39ve even thought of other ways i can use this combination of seasonings for other beef dishes thanks so much for sharing
i39ve made a lot of different pot roast recipes but this is by far the family favorite it has so much flavor it39s now the only recipe i use
this was delicious the meat was so moist and tender it was falling apart i added carrots and potatoes in with it and they were just as tasty this will be a regular on our menu
this was also posted on this bb at least 5 years ago subject die for crockpot roast posted by cubbybear replies 15 posted on 1132003 115202 am t126696 die for crock pot roast1 beef roast large enough to fit in your crockpot 1 pkg hidden valley ranch dressing mix 1 pkg brown gravy mix 1 pkg italian dressing mix 12 c warm waterplace roast in crockpot mix all three envelopes and sprinkle on top of roast pour water in the bottom of the crockpot cover and cook on low 6 to 7 hoursnote can use half of seasoning packages without jeopardizing the taste also you can add more water at end for more gravy
tried this recipe tonight and the gravy was much too salty for me will do again but with a low sodium italian dressing
made this tonight for a date with some adjustments i used either top round or bottom round roasts not sure which my butcher cut it for me i added six chopped smallish red potatoes 4 carrots cut into 12 inch pieces a sliced stalk of celery and a few tbsp minced garlic and a sliced onion i added 12 cup red cooking wine as well i also thickened it with a slurry of flour and water it turned out delicious the only thing i would do differently is leave out the onion for some reason i am not too pleased with the taste of onions in all the slow cooker recipes i have tried this is delicious though i sliced up one of the roasts and have it keeping warm in the gravy and the other i set aside in my fridge
this recipe is the same as to die for crockpot roast on recipezaarcom
i loved this potpoast but i need to know if the calories for 6oz is correct 142 i am on a diet thank you
really good very simple
this was in an issue many years ago i make it all the time my family loves it i cook noodles separtely and put some of the great juices over ityum my husband and the kids love it so easy
i have not made this pot roast but have made others and placed carrots cut up potatoes and onions on bottom with pot roast on top i probably would add some more liquid to this one at least another 12 cup
can you add potatoes and carrots and or other vegitables to this potroast with only about condiments or do you need to add more liquid
i live alone and i39m a big fan of this pot roast the leftovers make a great veriety of dishes
i am not a big pot roast fan but my dad made this and gave me some and me and my husband loved it it is now a staple in our house plus i love how simple it is
i added the potatocarrotand onion too and this meal had amazing flavor i will definetly be making this again thank you
wow this is really good my kids loved it and i shared it with coworkers who indicated their families liked it as well i did add potatoes onions and carrots as suggested making it a full meal thank you
so i lost the packet of ranch i bought the other day thus i used the italian onion soup packet ranch in a bottle and gravy packet i threw half a bag of baby carrots on top and 2 hrs later some quartered red potatoes it was amazing thought i was crazy mixing ranch and italian on pot roast but don39t be fooled comes out perfect
this is one of my favorite things to cook for my family it39s a hit every time and smells awesome while slowly cooking in the crockpot all day i also place onions potatoes and carrots in with the roast serve with the gravy and some fresh bread and it39s an excellent meal
this is outrageously good and easy you really should try this as all i have shared it with wind up making it more than once not only is the roast very flavorful it makes very good gravy as well a winner
i found this recipe to be very salty with the emflavorem of the marinade emoverpoweringem the meat i think i39ll keep looking lcofnc

wow this pumpkin bread is amazing my husband and i stop raving about it the only revision i made to the recipe was i used the whole can of pumpkin purée like a few other reviewers did as not to waste the pumpkin instead of making two loaves i also omitted using the 12 cup of water like the others did i appreciate their advice because this was magnificent and no other changes are needed i used 12 cup of raisins in it which tasted perfect this pumpkin bread is a keeper thank you joyce for posting this great recipe
best recipe and like that it makes one loaf i followed it to a t and included the walnuts and golden raisins the hubs said it was the best pumpkin bread i have ever made
doubled this recipe to make 2 loaves i cooked for 65 minutes took out of oven and began to cool it realized that it was not done and put back into the oven baked for another 25 minutes and took out still did not seem done followed the recipe to a t do not know what happened maybe too much oil any suggestions will not make again
absolutely the best pumpkin loaf i have ever made these are the few small changes i made used almost the entire can of pumpkin 14 butter amp 14 coconut oil 14 cup oj 1tbls water amp combined several sugars coconut cane amp packed brn but only 1 14 cups used lots of raisins amp chopped walnuts omg so moist so delicious thanks to the person in nova scovia next time i will double the recipe making 1 loaf amp a tray of cupcakes thank again
i tripled this recipe to give as gifts for the holidays it is so moist and flavorful it has the perfect blend of spices it39s a keeper
very good i made 2 loaves to use the whole can of pumpkin i subbed applesauce for the oil
i am not a big baker this bread was so simple i made this for my husband39s birthday and he absolutely loved it moist and flavorful he could not stop raving about it i will definitely be making this again and again
can i use fresh steamed and mashed pumpkin
have made this recipe for a number of years and have reduced some ingredients each time to find out what i can get away with i39ve reduced the sugar and the oil by half and also the eggs to only two sometimes only 1 i also use up any any amount of pumpkin that i have no matter if it39s only 1 cup or 2 or even a full can makes no difference as it always turns out delicious
made this for the first time this evening i did take one advice and used the whole can of pumpkin and omitted the water i also use cloves because i like the flavor of them baked for 75 min in a glass pan and it came out perfectly it is wonderful with a pat of butter while still warm will definitely make this again
i love this bread i39ve made double recipes all four times once i made it vegan which was the only time that the bread didn39t fall apart and leave its bottom in the pan tried waiting ten minutes tried waiting fifteen minutes what am i doing wrong i love to give this as presents but it looks kind of weird with the bottom coming off
i did this recipe and was soooo delicious it came out so rich and moist definitely doing this again
this is my first try at pumpkin bread i looked over the reviews before starting and i39m glad i took the advice of using the whole can of pumpkin and omitting the water it came out perfect i used a glass bread pan and it took 65 minutes just like the recipe stated i forgot to add walnuts i think it would be yummy with some spreadable cream cheese
i made two loaves so i could use the whole can one i cooked in glass pyrex and janet is correct mine took 1h20 minutes as well the second i baked in a metal pan and after 65 minutes it was done this pumkin bread remains a very dense and moist cake we liked the flavor but will not be making this again
so easy and so delicious
this was rich and really good i see it was submitted by someone in nova scotia i visit there a lot and everything from nova scotia is delicious
i have made pumpkin bread for a long time you can also do this in a bread machine on sweet or rapid cook
i39ve made alot of recipes for pumpkin bread but this might be the best inused pecans as i was out of walnuts no raisins but did add a bit of cinnamon the nutmeg and clove ratios were wonderful fulldiscloaure i used peanut oil instead of canola it was delicious
it was okay i agree with some users the ingredients aren39t proportional it was way to moist wet almost unfortunate as it is a waste of ingredients
i added just a few ounces of sarcasm and a pinch of annoyancethis bread turned out perfectly baked for 65 minutes and are you readyactually followed the recipe as written and am reviewing it as it was written i guess i39m living on the edge or something it was moist delicious and guess whatperfectly sweetened i wondered about the 15 cups of sugar but figured that since i was following a recipei should actually i don39t knowfollow the recipe i highly recommend trying this and maybe even following the recipe as written to get the best results
this is a very flexible recipei added about 1 12 to 2 cups of fresh pumpkin pure which i make from our jackolantern and freeze and was generous with the nuts and spices and it came out great both times it needs to bake for about 1 hour and 20 minutes so just make sure you test it yum
something in this recipe is way off with the ingredients my bread was not all all the correct mix of ingredients
i just finished making 7 of these breads plus 1 made with stevia for a diabetic friend they were easy andcame out looking great they smell divine so i am hoping they taste that way as well
this was very good i cut back on the sugar and nutmeg due to my tastes it was very moist everyone loved it
this was fantastic pumpkin 34bread34 these should actually be referred to as 34cakes34 used fresh baked pumpkin ground up the cloves and cinnamon sticks because it39s all i had in hand used standard cane sugar and some maple syrup and subbed all baking powder for the baking soda still turned out fantastic one thing i love about this recipe is that it uses 12c water instead if just going for the 1 entire cup of canola oil as less healthier recipes do would also try adding 1 or 2 teaspoons of vanilla next time forget canned pumpkin and used fresh if you can it makes a world of difference
i39ve made this twice so far it will be my goto pumpkin bread recipe it39s a very adaptable recipe and i39ll probably make it a little different each time i39ll never use 15c of sugar that39s for sure today i used 34th cup and it39s perfectly sweet
thid bread is fantastic it is my go to recipe
i love this recipe i made as written many times but the last time i added the entire can of pumpkin 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice i added chopped walnuts and put the mix into 2 smaller disposable loaf pans for sharing it was fantastic great either way but if you39re looking to use up your pumpkin without doubling the recipe it will work i think it39s more moist and has more pumpkin flavor great recipe i tell everyone to use it thanks
i39m disappointed i made 2 loaves today and neither of them was cooked through to the bottom even though i left them in for longer than 70 minutes and it39s not my oven
this bread is quick and has that perfect sweet and spice i look for in the cooler months i used one cup fresh pumpkin instead of canned dropped the oil down to 14 cup and used 14 cup of milk instead of the water super moist and fluffy
my favorite pumpkin bread i add cranraisins
i enjoyed this bread a lot it came together quickly with regard to mixing and it baked up beautifully i love that it is made with oil no creaming any butter so that makes it easier to mix up i have sometimes added 12 cup of chocolate chips to the recipe with excellent results
great loaf used pumpkin instead of water and used cake flour
great recipe easy to put together very moist
this is my favorite bread to date i doubled the recipe i always made banana nut bread as gifts but tried this with the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin skipped the water added walnuts and raisins of course i had to try it before giving it as gifts my husband and i loved it so much wei hit on the second loaf which left me with only two and then i had to bake four more as gifts yummy
perfect pumpkin bread use the whole can of pumpkin and skip the water made once with butter instead of canola oil and also once with apple sauce instead of the oil slices freeze well
this is the best pumpkin bread recipe ever i followed it to a t except did not use walnuts or raisins as my boyfriend does not like either of those he keeps telling me how delicious it is he even once referred to it as orgasmic i find the flavor and texture absolutely perfect i will make this again and again
excellent pumpkin bread added raisins only was out of walnuts
this was just an amazing pumpkin bread recipe i didn39t even notice that you were not supposed to use the whole can of pumpkin and it turned out delicious i added a spiced citrus glaze on top along with a few pumpkin seeds and let me tell you that was the best decision of my life
i usually follow recipes to the tee but i want to waste any pumpkin so i used the whole can and decided to reduce the water by half i figured the moisture from the pumpkin would replace the water i use this bread was insanely delicious and moist it last long in my house i am making two loaves tonight for potluck thanksgiving lunch at work this is a definite keeper the color of the bread is beautiful too
i tweaked this recipe by cutting back on the sugar using 12 c brown sugar 12 raw sugar used 5 soaked figs and saved 12 cup of that water in place of the regular water the figs gave added fiber without changing the flavor i will definitely be making this again
this will be my go to recipe from now on for pumpkin bread i followed the directions exactly as stated and it came out perfect
this is the best pumpkin loaf ever so moist and flavourful a keeper for sure
love this pumpkin bread read throught the reviews and made the following tweaks oj instead of water full can of pumpkin and dried cranberries instead of raisins delicious
absolutely delicious this is the only recipe i will use from now on when making pumpkin bread i followed the directions exactly as written great taste very moist yum only problem my family gobbled it up so quickly i will have to make another one
so took this and switched it up some real pumpkin not canned cooked pumpkin bake or microwave i only use real pumpkin for it is so abundant in the area i live pureed the pumpkin with all the wet ingredients but used orange juice instead of water coconut sugar instead of white for so many reasons and last white choc chips and walnutsi think we found a new favorite
awesome i used chocolate chips in place of nuts love it
this is the best pumpkin bread i39ve had much better than the recipe i39ve always used i added a whole can of pumpkin instead of one cup and didn39t alter the b soda or b powderbaked up wonderfully
this is a great recipe i cut the sugar down to one cup and used greek yogurt in place of half the oil and it was still really good and a bit healthier
i love this recipe it is the best pumpkin bread i have ever had
this is a my new favorite pumpkin bread recipe it is very moist and tastes just like pumpkin bread should taste i even made it with gf flour and it was still wonderful
this is the best pumpkin bread recipe i have ever eaten so moist and delicious it made 2 loaves so i am excited i will use this recipe every time i will try it with bananas sometime since i always end up with too many uneaten bananas mmmmmm
love pumpkin bread in the fall used choc chips instead of raisins
i love this recipevery moist and deliciousthis recipe makes awesome cookies toojust drop by teaspoon or tablespoon onto a cookie sheet and bake for 10 mins great for the upcoming holidays
delicious and moist pumpkin bread i did not add the spices because i wanted the full pumpkin flavor and instead of raisins i used craisins and plumped them first i winner in our house
i love pumpkin bread and this recipe is great just the right amount of pumpkin taste i might try and do muffins the next time i usually leave out the nuts and may try the suggestion to add cinnamon chips or butterscotch chips
tastes great i doubled the recipe and used walnuts and pecans this pumpkin bread is definitely a winner
very good i used my squash instead of pumpkin still tastes great
before i bake thiswhat size can of pumpkin
has anyone used fresh mashed pumpkins
i made these into 4 mini loaves i used cinnamon chips and less sugar instead of raisins and walnuts very easy to make
great receipe but i found with my oven i had to bake it about 80 minutes i baked the bread in a pyrex glass loaf pan added walnuts and raisens delicious
good flavor nice spice mine came out overly sweet though for my taste and a bit heavy not light and airy i had dried cranberries so i used those next time i will try with fresh
fabulous the only thing i did differently was to use two loaf pans instead of one and bake for 50 minutes they came out perfectly
why in the world to all you people review a recipe you make your own changes to it is frustrating to start reading and then realize it is not based on the recipe as written i spend more jumping on to the next one stick to the recipe
decided to try this recipe since i had all the ingredients with the exception of the nutmeg the family loved it and it39s now my go to pumpkin bread recipe i didn39t have nutmeg but i did have pumpkin pie spice so i substituted that for the cinnamon and nutmeg also i realized after i put the pan in the oven i forgot to add the salt but after tasting it without the salt i think i will just leave it out in the future too
i use pecans instead of walnuts but i just have to ask what is a large small bowl that just killed me
good easy to prepare
this recipe is very good i followed as is and it turned out excellent and the smell while it39s baking is even better for those people that completely change the recipe to suit their taste should not review the recipe it is not a true review of the recipe make it as is then review
i39ve come up with a much more diabeticfriendly version of this recipe by substituting whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour stevia for the white sugar and 14 cup unsweetened applesauce for half of the canola oil and added 12 teaspoon of ground ginger simply because i love the taste of ginger no one who39s tried my version has even noticed the difference but mine has less fat healthier carbs no sugar and more fiber
i thought this was a very good recipe i substituted some sour cream for some of the water and doubled the recipe to use a full can of pumpkin i substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar and reduced the sugar by 14 c i made a large loaf and 15 standard muffinsto those who changed the recipe and then it didn39t work out cooking is chemistrychange the formula and you can get unexpected results if you don39t compensate don39t blame the recipe
great recipe i added a little ginger to it now i39m embarrassed to admit this but i totally forgot about the oil and the bread turned out just fine it tasted amazing i didn39t realize i forgot it until i had already eaten some calories saved by this mistake 480 cal 52 grams of fat so i had two loaves which means that if you break it into 8ths you save 3 grams of fat per serving
best pumpkin bread i ever had add 23 tbsp extra flour i also added walnuts and pecansyum
i use golden raisins which i boil in the water called for in the recipe use a little extra for boil off then roll the raisins in flournot too much and fold in to batter they will not be chewy they will be delicious and they will not go to bottom of pan and burn
like others i substituted 12 cup applesauce for the 12 cup water i substituted ground ginger for the nutmeg since my family won39t eat anything with nutmeg left out the raisins since one son won39t eat raisins otherwise followed the recipe exactly whole family raved about it being the best pumpkin bread ever and it disappeared in record time moist from beginning to end and delicious delicious delicious
this is one recipe that my kids love i reduce the amount of sugar to 34 of a cup and add 23 bananas each time i make this recipe i also decrease the oil to 14 cup i bake it for about 75 minutes it is a family favorite
made lots of alterations used pecans instead of walnuts more cinnamon and less sugar also added 1 tsp cardamon i also decreased the oil and used applesauce instead and instead of water i used milk
love this recipe i added pecan instead of walnuts thought the pecans would give it a better flavor instead of walnuts so good
wow came out great doubled the recipe added 12 cup applesauce to can pumpkin to make 2 cups only used 3 eggs half applesauce half coconut oil in place of canola 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup white total half cup soy milk in place of the water streusel on top baked 75 minutes
i absolutely loved this recipe i surprisingly ran out of oil so i improvised i instead used only 14 cup oil and 1 cup almond milk i reduced the liquids because i also added 12 cup more pumpkin to the loafi have baked this recipe both ways and fell equally this has by far been the best pumpkin bread i have bakednote the best way to keep your bread moist is to turn off the oven when you are a couple minutes from being fully done and letting the pumpkin bread cook slowly for about 510 minutes in the turned off oven make sure to cover snugly once the pan is cool enough to grab or else it will dry out thank you so much for the recipe
moist tender and tasty i followed the recipe as it stated except i used 12 amount of sugar it turned out just the way we liked it thanks for sharing
i had to make this with all purpose gluten free flour with xanthan gum and it was still so moist and flavorful i39m making another loaf today
i made this recipe for a reception and every piece went the loaf i kept at home didn39t last that much longer delicious i did substitute orangepineapple juice for the water i39m making again tonight with the leftover pumpkin from the first recipe
this was an amazing easy recipe to follow i did bake mine in my longerthinner bread pan 13 x 4 12 and was done in an hour for the pumpkin i used leftover mashed sweet potatoes and also added the raisins this is a 39keeper recipe39 yum
didn39t last a day at my house excellent recipe
i39m glad i finally found an excellent recipe for pumpkin bread that has some spice to it i saw some cans of pumpkin in my pantry and decided to try this my husband loved it in fact after only one day it is gone i plan to make some of these for my relatives for christmas the only things added were a little brown sugar on top and some additional walnuts yum this recipe is definitely a keeper
with 78 of the 87 respondents giving this recipe a 5 star rating i took the plunge and made a double batch without ever trying the recipe out what good is half a can of pumpkin puree right unless you make a smoothie and i39ve already had my breakfast i39ve got just over an hour before my first tastingyes this definitely is 5 star pumpkin bread and i think it39s way better than starbuck39s versionfyi i omitted raisins and walnuts the next time i make it which will be later today i will add some topping just like starbucks i39m going to bring some to share for the holiday this week and freeze a couple to have on hand i will add some walnuts to one of the next two loaves i make i used two different bread pans one dark metal and one glass the metal one took longer to bake in the center i set the timer for 60 minutes as i always go under with my oven and the one in glass pan was not ready i gave it an extra 10 minutes which was only 5 minutes more than the recommended baking time
the center of my loaf wasn39t completely cooked until 1 hour 35 minutes even though i foiled the edges my loaf still turned out very dark with a slight burnt flavor nonetheless the bread remained moist i substituted raisins with chocolate chips not terribly impressed with this recipe
this is delicious i39ve made half a dozen loaves in the past month i have a houseful of pumpkin anything fans better than starbucks don39t get the bad review something was off maybe the oven mine39s turned out perfectly every time
moist deliciousand easy made per recipe except left out the nuts and raisins loved it
terrible never cooked through even after 2 hours i checked to make sure i had added all ingredients correctly so sad it had such good reviews the part that did cook was super bland i will definitely be trying another recipe

this is a very good bread i did make a few changes to try to make it healthier i used splenda instead of sugar i used one egg and one serving of egg beaters i used one cup of all purpose flour and 23 cup of whole wheat flour i also halved the oil and added 14 cup of water blended with one whole orange pureed in place of some of the oil also i added one teaspoon of maple extract it turned out moist and very tasty
so moist and delicious the kids and i loved it did not add the walnuts or raisins had to foil the edges so they wouldn39t burn while the middle was still cooking

excellent bread easy and quick to make
this is delicious i didn39t add the nutmeg or cloves none on hand but did add raisins
the best pumpkin bread recipe i39ve found yet so moist and flavorful lori in wi
this bread was so delicious and moist i think i used chopped pecans in my first batch and we didn39t really like them next time i may try another nut or just leave them off entirely i also added some nutmeg and cloves to bring out some of the flavor and next time i may add more pumpkin spice nutmet and cloves next time to see if it helps bring out the flavor other than that this was a great recipe that i will be making again in the fall
i just got done making this bread for 7 different families for christmas they absolutely loved it i baked a loaf yesterday for myself and i will have to say half of the loaf is already gone excellent bread i39m sure i will be making this one many more times to come
don39t mess with perfection if you are looking for a really good christmas bread or anytime this takes 1st place i did omit raisons and nuts as i don39t want any other flavors interfering with my pumpkin even the ends are good and was not as oily as other recipes i39ve tried
made one batch with golden raisins and one batch plain i used applesauce instead of oil but that39s the only change i made these came out delicious especially with the raisins
this is a great recipe i used one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other seasonings and probably should have used a little more but it is really good
very good recipe i make it without nuts or raisins for picky family members it was very flavorful and just the right texture yum i may have added just a tiny smidge more cloves than called for it39s a flavor i love
what a great recipe i made today for my friend39s baby shower and everyone loved it i used a 9in x 13in pan and cut it in squares i39ll be making it for the up coming holidays
moist and tasty also made another version of the same recipe omitting water and subbing orange juice and rind replaced the raisins and nuts with frozen and dried cranberries definitely a pair of keepers
i made this today was very moist tasted great easy to do would make again
doubled the recipe and made 2 big loaves it was really delicious i will definately make it again as is and also make it with mini chocolate chips and pecans very moist great texture not too oily
this sounds delish i like the pineapple suggestion do you use tidbits drained for that i will be making this next time i can get ome pumpkin at the store yumm
omit the raisins and add a large bag of milk chocolate chips a big hit with my family
this recipe is so easy and delicious i made it without the raisins but the pumpkin nut was a hit in my house great recipe
i made this last night i followed the directions and made no changes it is so moist and delicious used both raisins and nuts it39s super simple to make also you don39t even need to get out your electric mixer i39ll make this again for sure
this was a very moist bread i made 3 loaves one with hazelnuts one with pineapple and one with hazelnuts and golden raisins the pineapple won hands down
i39m doing this but using lasagna noodles and red enchilada sauce
i made this with corn tortillas you need a few more since they39re smaller my family loved it it even reheated well in the microwave this is going in the easy fast good recipes book
maybe i39m a little prejudiced but i have trouble trusting a recipe that uses a spice mix what39s up with that how difficut is it to shake out the cumin and corriander
on rotation frequently for dinner meals family really enjoys it
with only 2 of us at home now i make this using 2 round cake pans the first one is perfect for us for a couple days and the second goes in the freezer for next time
this was so good the only change i made was use a bag of frozen peppers and onions because i didn39t have fresh my son and i loved it thank you
this is the best recipe for taco lasagna its easy and a lot less time consuming than other recipes i39ve made this recipe at least 20 times and it always turns out great you an freeze it after making it or after it39s been cooked great for pot lucks or taking to someone in need try it you will love it i serve mine with toppings of chopped fresh tomatoes salsa and shredded lettuce
this recipe is a staple i39m in texas and we still love it i use plantbased meat substitute but otherwise follow the recipe very tasty and a crowd pleaser
i have made this recipe numerous times i use more ground beef usually 1 amp 12 lbs and more cheese everyone always raves about this dish
had this tonight and everyone loved it delicious this recipe is a keeper made my own taco seasoning
made this for dinner last night and the family loved it i used corn tortillas instead of flour i used sweet yellow and red peppers had on hand i doubled the recipe and so didn39t use refried beans since two cans of black beans were in it i also added black olives my mom loves olives will make it again for sure
this was a big hit in my house everyone loved it i served with sour cream and salsa it39s a keeper recipe i will definitely make again great flavor thanks for sharing
this was really easy and quite tasty i did use a few more tortillas three per layer and used 1lb of turkey and 12 lb of ground beef also no black beans or green pepper on hand so i doubled the refried beans topped with shredded lettuce and sour creamyum
my family and i enjoyed this very much i used a round deep dish and tortillas about the same size i prefer drained mashed pintos instead of retried beans i care for tomato chunks so i puréed the canned mexican flavored diced tomatoes added a can of diced green chilies as well to the meat mixture my husband felt like it needed more tortillas than the three used for the layers i might try doubling next time i used to make something similar that had fritos in it he wants me to add some next time served with sour cream and guacamole it was yummy
i made this two days ago and it39s a keeper for sure i put a four ounce can of mild chiles in it i would have preferred hot chiles but my husband didn39t it was very easy to make and it didn39t take long bake we have been eating it for the last three days and i not one for leftovers every day when we heated it up the aroma was wonderful my husband raved about it and when he finished eating he told me he loved me make this recipe i will thankyou thankyou jennifer
it was very tasty but hard to cut into portions my husband said prefer it if i made the filling and gave him the tortillas and cheese so he could make tacos with it that would solve the cutting problem it is really just a big taco in a dish
recipe was easy lasagna was amazing i substitute brown rice in instead of the beans and it was still good will be making again
very good i like corn tortillas and from past experiences i know flour tortillas get mushy so i used corn i also added sliced olives and used the onion a little it is a easy meal to make to your taste i will make this again
this dish has become a frequent dinner in my house hold my kids and husband love it
since there39s just my husband and i what i love about this recipe is the ability to halve it i prep the entire filling ingredients and either freeze it in two parts or use a half for that evening39s meal i39ve made it with both chicken and 9010 ground beef and the chicken is our favorite we returned from visiting family for thanksgiving and i plucked out the ziplock bag of filling and it39s in the oven right now smelling so good we dollop on some sour cream and the hubster likes hot sauce for extra zing i have this recipe saved to my ipad home screen for quick reference great creation
fallowed direction then added my own twist easier to make own taco seasoning then added pinch of brown sugar and about teaspoon ancho chili spice used ground turkey and 34corn34 tortillas flour tortillas end up as mosh for left overs thanks for other comments made me realize it39s a good go to recipe
i39ve been making this for many years my husband and i love it perfect as is you can add toppings as you would to a taco delicious
as written this is just ok to m fairly good but not 5 stars for my taste it is similar to mine except for a 9x13 pan i use almost 2x the beef
awesome outstanding chopped up some jalapeo and added to half since wife can39t handle the heat plan to add nibblet corn next time to try something a little different definitely a new family favorite
this recipe is so yummy and easy to make absolutely loved it will make this many more times for sure
made this tonight and had a tastey dinner i altered just a little by adding more hamburger thus more seasoning however i only had 1 pkt of taco seasoning so i used what i had on hand 1 pkt fajita seasoning it came out good i also added crushed corn chips sliced avacado banana peppers amp cilantro yum i finished it by adding fat free sour cream amp shredded lettuce when served
very very good my family loved it thank you for sharing this recipe
yummy cut the corn tortillas in half and place the cut sides to the edges of the dish and then fill the center with one cut half as others have suggested i also heat the refried beans and mix in with the meat mixture because my dh requires a low sodium diet i use my own taco seasoning recipe salt free canned tomatoes or my own canned tomatoes and add chopped jalepeno pepper this is one of my best potluck recipes
excellent recipe easy enough for kids to help
excellent recipe the second time we made it before serving we topped it with a generous amount of chopped lettuce amp diced tomatoes the topped with some sour cream have made several times always a big hit
great recipe the first time i made it i followed the recipe excellent made it again but added an additional taco seasoning packet and a can of corn and upped the cheese to 4 cups even better used two 8inch round pans and had enough left over to make a handful of burritos a definite winner
tried a few recipes this one is the best the retried beans made it i change a thing
this recipe is great with either flour or corn tortillas and in my own opinion is even better topped with fresh chopped lettuce and tomatoes
i made this exactly as posted several times and just loved it i39ve started having to watch my cholesterol intake since then so made these changes i used ground turkey and multigrain tortillas along with lofat cheese and sour cream having picked up refried black beans by mistake i went ahead and dumped it in i swear it tasted just as good as the original recipe i love when that happens
i tried this last night and was impressed this recipe is a keeper i omitted the refried beans because my daughter absolutely hates them and left out the green pepper cuz i39m not a fan also substituted corn tortillas for regular tortillas because my husband is severely allergic to gluten but did the rest as described and we loved it will definitely make this again
this recipe is great i prepared it as written i was amazed at how easy the whole dish went together i couldn39t find mexican tomatoes so i used diced tomatoes with green chilies my grandson and his friends were having a gathering and they all loved it i did use more cheese like 3 8oz packages next time and there will be a next time i think i will cut the tortillas in strips as 1 reviewer did as it was a bit difficult cutting portions
try it with chili beans and use their sauce
made this last night only one word describes the casserole 34delicious 34 the only thing i did was at 12 italian sausage and 12 ground turkey because that is what i had this is a keeper
very quick and easy used ingredients i always have on hand very tasty i was going to cut the recipe down for 2 so instead of two cans of beans i used refried black beans
my kids picked around the beans and the tomatoes essentially leaving tacos i may make this one again i enjoyed the flavor but it was too close to regular tacos to justify the extra time and pans required
so easy and so delicious i used corn tortillas and put it under the broiler for 2 minute at the end to make the cheesy tortillas nice and crisp
so easy to prepare i used 15 lbs of beef absolutely delicious whole family enjoyed it some was even taken to the girlfriends house
fabulous make it just as it it39s written it needs no changes everyone in my family loves this and it39s a nice change from tacos
we liked this but i left out the black beans it was a good meal and we had lots leftover would cut recipe in half next time
i use newmans own salsa far superior in taste be careful it has lots of varities like peach or pineapple that do not go with this try medium not too hot and definately more flavor than tomatoes about the sodium content by i reviewer try making your own there are lots of recipes online but basically 1 t each cumin chilli powder onion powder garlic powder and a scant toregano 14t salt is optional i round up the cumin just a bit and go a bit scant one the chili powder but a mix of regular and chipolte chilli powder is good too that will taste just like the envelope or better according to reviews plus no sodium also look for fat free refried beans 85 lean or ground turkey needs a tad more seasoning lowers the fat these swaps do not chang the flavor at all add in stuff include corn jalapenos olives once i topped it with crushed hard taco shellsi also cut the tortillas into 3 strips to look like34 lasagna 34noodles it cuts easier too
this recipe was good i made a few changes for my family we don39t care for black beans so i omitted them fast easy amp yummy
this is super easy to put together and fabulously delicious i found this to be perfectly flavorful especially topped with your favorite toppings like taco sauce salsa salsa verde sour cream chopped fresh cilantro however you like to dress up your tacos i wasn39t sure what the recipe meant by mexican diced tomatoes but by the size of the can it calls for i knew it wasn39t rotel although it would probably be fine i used red gold petite diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro which is located with all the other kinds of canned diced tomatoes and it worked out very well this makes a lot but don39t worry it reheats really well
we loved thisi doubled the ground beef and added some frozen corn
i think this would be great with polenta slices instead of the tortillas
i made this tonight i left out the refried beans alsothe last two top torilas so only needed 4 didn39t need as much cheese as recipe calls for only used 2 12 cups or less
excellent love it and so does everybody else
i froze half a lasagna as one was too large for my hubby and me took out of freezer defrosted at room temp and warmed in a low oven but found the topping noodle very crispy anddry kind of ruined the taste how do i reheat frozen lasagna keeping soft and juicy
i have been making this recipe for years now and have shared with many others i follow the recipe as is but use pinto beans instead of black beans also at times i will use mexican chihuahua cheese this is certainly a household favorite in our family
easy recipe quick to prepare my 3 year old loves it i made the following tweaks used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned added black olives omitted the onion amp served with a dollop of sour cream on top this recipe is now requested a couple of times a month in my house great alternative to the basic taco
so simple and so delicious i didn39t have green peppers so i used tomatoes and green chiles after baking i added sour cream lettuce and taco sauce the next time i make it i will probably add more cheese a little more taco seasoning and corn very good
why is there always someone that has to comment on sodiumm nutritional value chances are that if a person is making any of these recipes they are an adult i39m pretty sure that everyone is capable of making their own decision as to whether or not they want to eat something mind your own business people look at these reviews to read about what others thought of the recipe when they made it the nutritional information is posted for everyone to see if that is a concern for them
i used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes
very tasty but it has well over 12 of a person39s daily requirement of sodium i would avoid eating this except is very small amounts
people ask for the recipe when i fix this dish everyone is surprised that it is so easy to prepare we all love it
i made this tonight for dinner and it was awesome my husband said i had better not lose this recipe he absolutely loved it i also added corn and a little extra taco seasoning and more cheesethis will for sure be one of my new 34go to34 meals
delicious and i like how this recipe can be customized to satisfy your own unique tastes to the meat mixture i added corn chopped green olives and a couple teaspoons of lime juice lots of extra cheese on the layers top it all off with shredded lettuce tomatoes salsa sour cream jalapenos corn chips avocados to name just a few to those who commented that the refried beans are too hard to spread heat the refried beans in the microwave first and the consistency will soften for easier spreading make sure you cover the dish before baking so it doesn39t dry out or get too crispy enjoy
this was great i didn39t have green peppers so i omitted them but it was still great pretty simple to make too
i do not recall ever seeing beans used in tacos or lasagna
i39ve been making this recipe for several years now and my husband just loves it we make it as specified in the recipe and think it is amazing
my family loves it just the way it is
great base recipe to easily exchange to make it for your own family
this is delicious easy to play around with and vary it i never make it the same way twice i always add more cheese than it calls for and put in 3 or 4 minced fresh serrano peppers like others mentioned i usually swap out the flour tortillas for corn it makes enough for the 2 of us each to have a good hearty serving 2 nights in a row this is one of those satisfying comfort foods that really fill you up and put you in that wonderful food coma right after eating
i used 2 cans of black beans and omitted the refried beans i exchanged corn tortillas for flour and increased the cheese to 4 cups instead of a 145 oz can of tomatoes try using two cans 10 oz each of rotel tomatoes
i have made this a few times the first time i made this my 8 and 10 yr olds looked at it and were hesitant since then they have requested it when we make our weekly menus i also mixed the refried beans with the meat mixture because otherwise the beans are thick and a pain to spread my 10 year old son did 90 of the work the last time i made this and it is not typical that my kids request leftovers the next day but they do for this
this was so easy and delicious i also mixed the refried beans into the meat mixture for easier assembly and it was fantastic everyone loved it i served with lettuce tomato salsa and sour cream for people to add as they wished
make this so often for potlucks dont always use the black beans
this was delicious i used shredded chicken and corn tortillas and added jalapenos topped with lettuce tomatoes cilantro avocado jalapenos and sour cream kids loved it too
this a very good recipe i made my own refried beans which is better than the canned my husband loves texmex and mexican food so this will be made again soon i added some shredded lettuce and sour cream on top once it was platted very good
everyone raved about this dish i will make it again soon
great quick recipe i mixed the retried beans in with the meat and black beans to make it easier to assemble i also added fresh corn which i cut off the cob great recipe for a weeknight
good recipe i loved the black beans in it
good recipe to reduce the amount of fat i used fat free refried beans and nondairy 34cheese34 i also used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas fat free tortillas can also be used to reduce the fat even further
my family is crazy for this i add sliced or chopped black olives with the cheese on top
yummy i made it ahead of time and when i warmed it up in the oven i think i had it in there for too long as it just turned into slop but it tasted so good i39ll make this again
very good
this recipe tasted great the flavors really come together and i believe kids would really like it i am only giving it four stars because between them chopping browning and baking this recipe takes at least 40 minutes to prepare
i prefer to use corn tortillas the flour ones39 get soggy i also use poblano or anaheim pepper don39t care for the bell pepper familyalso added can of sliced black olive can of corn and can diced green chiles
has a really good taste i did change it a bit by putting the refried beans in with the meat mixture just much easier also added lettuce tomatoes taco sauce amp sour cream on top will put in my keeper list
great easy dinner for the whole family to enjoy
family favorite i have made this with both beef and chicken i also add a half of a can of corn and a half can of diced green chilies i prefer to use organic whole grain white corn tortillas and sometimes i skip the last layer of tortilla altogether as well as one of the cheese layers cutting a layer of tortillas and a third of the cheese does nothing to reduce the taste serve with tossed salad and corn bread so good
made this last night amp got good reviews from the family not spicy at all think i will add black olives the next time to see how that changes the flavor
great recipe you can change it up according to what you havecooked chicken instead of hamburger etc once i used hummus instead of refried beans as i didn39t have any on hand hummus was great too i also put olives in the layers corn is good tooanything works
very tasty
sounds delicious how many carbs per serving please lots of diabetics in my family and we have to court carbs
this sound amp looks delishi am going to try this
this recipe is delicious i made a few substitutions lean ground turkey low sodium black beans lowfat ricotta cheese no refried beans whole wheat tortillas and lowfat cheese i had to cook it a little longer 30 minutes covered and 1015 minutes uncovered i like my tortillas crispy
my family loved this and that is all i needed to know you can make all types of variations with this my husband added sour cream to his second serving i liked when the tortillas were crispy a complete favorite in my home the kids said 34add this to your recipe box34
this was super and quick we thought that it was full of flavor and so easy
it does make the outer edge of the casserole bit crispy on the tortillas when bake for 30 minutes but it is a great time saving recipe if you need dinner on the table fast if you like southwestern food it would be a good recipe to try out i just suggest baking it for 20 or 25 minutes any longer the outer edges of the tortilla will be to crispy
wow what can i say i submitted this recipe 12 years ago on a whim and it won me 50000 and a feature in quick cooking i am so excited to see everyones39 reviews and modifications i am married now and my family loves this recipe too crazy to see 86 reviews written who knew
this is delicious i did add extra cheese i love cheese i added chopped roma tomatoes sliced black olives and sour cream to the top when serving i think i will add chopped green onions the next time love this and my husband loved it i39m glad to see that it warms up good will definitely make again
very good i served it with sour cream and that39s tops it off to great i changed the original recipe ground turkey breast canned diced tomatoes canned green chiles added mexicorn used la tortilla factory tortillas ff refried beans and 16 ounces vs12 cheese i baked 375º for 30 minutes covered then uncovered and baked for another 30 minutes the top got nice and crispy so good and would serve 12
this was pretty good but not a favorite as far as 34mexican34 lasagnas go my family likes the other one i make better
my mom made this for us and it was delicious good as leftovers the next day also she used red beans instead of black beans and she also served it with sour cream i loved the refried beans in there this is definitely a keeper
i am not a bean lover but this was really really good i went a little lighter on the refried beans and it was awesome and i used salsa instead of diced tomatoes love it
loved this one except i left out the refried beans and mexican style tomatoes instead i used fire roasted tomatoes shredded lettuce and added in salsa top with sour cream this one is to die for i plan to make this again next week
this was easy to make and it came out really good my husband ate 12 the taco lasagna in 1 sitting adding a little sour cream to each serving is delicious
this is a keeper easy and delicious
i tryed this and it was very good added my home grown green peppers bigger chunks
i have made this recipe several times and it39s a winner every time i do like to add a dollop of sour cream on top when serving this i also use a tad more ground beef and cheese than called for simple easy you can39t go wrong
i made this recipe exactly as written and mine came out much drier i think it should have we were really disappointed in it the first night the second night i served with sour cream and enchilada sauce and it was much better but still not something that i would make it again if i did make it again i would make some changes one of which would be to incorporate the sour cream and the enchilada sauce into the layers i would liked to have given this 2 ½ stars it was not awful so i did not want to give it 2 stars just not that special it does make a lot
we added black olives to this
made this for dinner tonight whole family loved it however i made a few changes right off the bat my current changes were i used whole wheat flour tortillas venison burger about 1 12 pounds two packets of taco seasoning 4 cups 2 8oz bags of shredded mexican cheese we also added sour cream and guacamole as a garnishthings i will do differently next time i make it i will use sliced green onions in beef mixture and as a garnish i will use a tub of fresh salsa instead of mexican diced tomatoes and when i do that i will delete the 23 cup water because fresh salsa has way more juice than a can of diced tomatoes and i would definitely break up the top layer of tortilla39s and spread them evenly cuz those were tough to cut i had to perforate them with a sharp knife to get an even cut even sprinkled with cheese and baked they were not soft enough to cut pieces with the spatulaother than my changes this was an awesome first time recipe for us and we liked it
this is one of my favorite dinner recipes it is so easy to assemble and so yummy i add some frozen corn to the beef mixture and serve it with lettuce and jalapeño yum
very good dish i made 12 recipe but i did not cut the beef in half i replaced the green pepper with 12 can of green chiles and i used sharp cheddar cheese i also used brown rice tortillas as one person does not eat wheat i may try corn tortillas next time this is a good recipe thanks for sharing it
i made this last night and it was fantastic usually when i39ve made a new dish i39ll ask my husband if he likes it and he39ll just say 34it39s good34 when i made this i didn39t even had to ask when he finally came up for air he said 34 this is fricken39 delicious34 so a winner in our house my husband isn39t a fan of beans so i subbed corn for the black beans and only used about 23 of the can of refried beans
i added some chopped cilantro to the meat mixture for added taste amp i also used one can of chopped green chillis instead of green peppers cover top layer with tinfoil because the top of mine browned amp got crunchy but it was still good thanks for recipe
nice comfort food i used diced tomatoes with green chilies bc i couldn39t find the mexican ones the sauce was really spicy in the pan but cooled off in the mix of the casserole served with sour cream and lettuce will add jalapenos next time
this recipe is awesome i make it frequently i have just started weight watchers does anyone know how many points a serving of this would be need protein carbs fat amp fiber to calculate thanks glenyah
winner winner we loved our dinner
so good loved this recipe so did my two girls my 18month old ate as big of a piece as i did and asked for more i will definitely be making this again update 522014 i make this dish on a regular basis still a family favorite however this recipe fills a 9x13 casserole dish which is a little too much for us to eat in a couple of days what i39ve started doing is mixing all of the filling together ground beef onion pepper water taco seasoning black beans and diced tomatoes i also started mixing in the refried beans so it39s simpler to put together and the taste is the same then i divide the entire recipe in half i use 3 tortillas half the filling and half the cheese and make up a 8x8 dish then i take the remaining half of just the filling and freeze it in a freezer container next time i want to make this dish i defrost the filling and then make another 8x8 casserole works perfect for my family
great substituted corn for black beans and still delicious recommend draining meat mixture before layering into lasagna to make the final product less runny that worked really well for us
very yummy filling and reheats well
excellent the first time i ate this my awesome aunt made it loved it since
my husband makes this easy dish at the firehouse all the time it39s a hit and all the guys love it
this is fabulous trying new recipes is fun but you never know if the family is going to like them they loved this even our guest for dinner asked for the recipe will be making this again it is so easy and simple to put together
this was awesome the entire family loved it
i made this for a birthday party i was hosting and it was a big hit fed lots of people to rave reviews
this was really good amp simple to make will definately make again
yum so quick and easy to make can39t wait to have it again
wow when i find something that my whole family loves we know that recipe is a keeper the only thing different was that i garnished with sour cream fresh tomatoes and some shredded cheese that was just a preference thing excellent
this recipe was so quick and easy and best of all it was delicious it tasted even better the next day just like real lasagna love it
one of thee best meals to make gets better as it marinates overnight
delicious recipe i plan to keep this recipe on hand to make again my family loved it
this was very good and easy made it according to recipe and no changes will make this for the potluck tonight
this has become one of our family favorites i use corn tortillas in place of the flour and pinto beans instead of black since my kids aren39t big fans of the black it39s wonderful
this was very good have a lot left over going to freeze some of it i used whole wheat tortillas and weight watchers mexican cheese this was really yummy
very delish could almost use as a dip
my family absolutely loved this dish and requested that we have it again
this is a fabulous recipe anyone i know who has tried it just loves it great as leftovers too using cheddar cheese gives more of a rich flavor though there39s so much going on that you really don39t need it and if you like spicy you can use hot rotel add jalepenos or substitute pablano pepper for green bell pepper
my husband is a firefighter and makes it for the guys at the station he gets tortilla chips and sour cream so the guys can get creative they love it it is a yummy recipe
a very good lasagna in fact you can see your published and copyrighted version on sites on the web so it must be good
great recipe is awesomeso easy to make and my husband and son loved itsons says he is adding this recipe to his favoriteswill def make again
this is going to go into my actual recipe box to make sure i have it forever more a must have in the dinner rotation
love this recipe added some light sour cream and jalapenos for garnish
by the way i substitute lowcarb tortillas diabetes and it does not lose a thing
i have made this twice first the way it was shown and second i added more stuff and played with the cheeses and flavors of rotel that is offered this flys out of the kitchen so fast it39s crazy
the boys in the family love this one reader sent in a good ideaspread refried beans on tortillas while they are on a flat surface and then place in the pan so much easier
my husband and i enjoy this dish and make it for company i like to cut some extra tortillas and place around the edges so that each layer is completely separated we also make it without the refried beans occasionallyit is a winner
mine did not look anything like that picture it was very good it just looked like two pizza39s i will be making this again
the best lasagna i39ve eaten the family couldn39t get enough
this is my favorite way to use up overripe bananas and the cream cheese frosting makes them so yummy love this recipe
i have been making this recipe for almost 20 years my daughters boyfriend loved them so much that he use to bring all the ingredients over so i would make a pan for him to take home with him i keep getting asked to make these simple yet extremely yummy banana bars
so easy to make and everyone loved them
i love how it came out amp i didn39t change anything but the frosting i only put 2 cups of confectioners sugar amp i added 2 tablespoons of chocolate hazelnut spread
i have not made these yet however i have a suggestion for all baking followersi made a journal regarding measurements of all kinds start weighing your ingredients everything from fruit to nuts you will be very surprised at the differences of volume example one cup of flour is 414 ounces bisquick and bread flour is also 414 ounces per cup a large banana is approx 48 ounces14 cup of brown sugar is 20 ounces same for granulatedjust a few examples over the years we have used way too much ingredients that changed the recipehence the differences of results happy baking everyone
horrible bars were super dense no flavor super disappointed
i made these for my daughters school lunches they were a huge hit i did 1 cup white sugar 1 cup brown sugar i also added half a bag of semisweet chocolate chips into the batter
really delicious and moist hubby doesn39t like cake but ate three pieces of this only changes i made were to half the icing sugar in the frosting and left out the butter in frosting everyone loved them
i make this recipe several times a year i find i can cut the sugar to 15 cups and i like to add raisins and walnuts or pecans they freeze well
love love love this recipe have made it many times when my bananas get too ripe i toss them in the freezer then when i have enough i make bars yum an extra banana adds extra moist banana y goodness
oh my this is good nice and moist with wellbalanced banana flavor my kids said it rivaled carrot cake which they love the cream cheese frosting rounds out the flavor definitely a keeper recipe and a great way to use up overripe bananas
absolutely delicious
i have been making this recipe for 20 years and anyone who has tried it just loves it it39s wonderful and a quick dessert my daughter39s old boyfriend use to bring over the stuff to make it and i would make a batch just for him
i made these and they turned out way to sugary and not moist at all why two cups of sugar when you have the natural sweetness of the bananas really disappointed
made this recipe to the letter except added walnuts to the batter and frosting batter mixes up well and bakes quickly in the sheet cake pan frosting is tasty but does not have as strong of a cream cheese flavor as recipes made without the added butter this one has the cake is relatively moist and has a nice texture but without any spices it tastes a bit bland i will make this again but will add some cinnamon andor nutmeg to give it a bit of a boost in flavor
excellent for the frosting i substituted 1tsp banana extract and 1tsp vanilla extract it made such a huge difference i love bananas had tons of compliments definitely make it again and again and again
excellent i cut sugar in half and used a little brown sugar as some other reviewers did and only made half the icing recipe very tender moist perfect texture best banana bread i have had
made it with a brown butter frosting instead
i have made this recipe numerous of times
kareni got your recipe when it was first published in taste of home currently living in egypt and i make it a lot we have a banana vendor almost at my front door thank you so much for sharing
these bars are amazing i39d eat the whole pan myself i use only one cup of sugar and 4 ripe bananas they are sweet without the exra cup plus adding the frosting makes them even sweeter not sure what 2star pamala did back in feb 2020 but ive been making these for years tried and true this recipe is definitely more then 5 stars its quick to maje as well kids and adults will love it
i have made this so many times it is a favorite of ours freezes in cut pieces very well i usually add about 12 c ground walnuts just because we love them
wow these were the best banana bars i39ve ever made to begin i used country crock olive oil plant butter i only had 1 cup of white sugar so to substitute i added 12 cup of brown sugar not packed and a scant cup of chocolate chips while still warm i drizzled with my own cardamom glaze made of butter milk powdered sugar vanilla and ground cardamom i am not a fan of cream cheese frosting this was not my first time making these but the above changes elevated this recipe to a whole new level
made this today and both my husband and i thought it is delicious i cut back on the sugar used about 1 12 cups we don39t like cake too sweet i also make a glaze for top 1 cup powdered sugar 2 tablespoons milk 12 teaspoon vanilla plus couple dashes of nutmeg i baked it in a glass 15x10 baking dish at 325 for about 30 min glaze was sufficient for that size
this was awesome i didn39t have the big pan so i did as someone noted and made in 13x9 it was very moist and had good banana flavor i would definitely make this again thanks for a great recipe
these are so good and i haven39t even frosted them yet think i might just dust with a little powdered sugar this time so we can eat them right away like now
these are amazing loaded with flavor i did add an extra banana to the batter and a tablespoon of corn syrup and honey to the frosting
i made these today wonderful change a thing i added cinnamon because i thought the recipe called for it i love banana cake bars bread this is
pamela rated it 2 stars because the bars turn out she clearly added things to the recipe and threw it off balance this is such an easy and tasty recipe my family loves them
i have been making these bars for many many years we call it 34banana cake34 but it is one of the most requested recipes that i make they are delicious and moist plenty of flavor i have a photo of the recipe in my phone so i can send it to people after i have prepared it for a large group
more like a flat sheet cake should have made cupcakes with frosting instead not bar like at all i did know better to add some spices otherwise it would have been a bland even though i added 4 large bananas i also used 14 cup brown sugar in hopes it would add more depth no chance back to the family cookbook for me
this pie looks marvellously delicious
made in a 9 pan baked for 45 min added chopped pecans to the mix and over the frosted bars delicious as always
this is a great the only recipe i use for overripe bananas i add walnuts or pecans and raisins it freezes especially well i cut it into bars first
a friend made this for us really good have a nice taste texture and moist these are great for family and friends also for a social pot luck there won39t be any left for the next day
this is my second review and it is still thee best banana bar recipe you can use a 1334 x 934 greased pan increase baking time to 35 minutes or until done you only need half of the frosting recipe and it is the perfect amount for the 1334 x934
wonderful i39d give it 10 stars if i could having a hard time keeping my hands from snatching a piece every time i walk past the fridge
outstanding i took this to a party having never made it before and it got rave reviews i also baked it in a 13 x 934 pyrex pan and increased the cooking time somewhat based on other reviewer suggestions it came out great i didn39t have enough confectioner39s sugar so i reduced the butter and cream cheese somewhat and added a little milk to help it spread better it still came out delicious
i absolutely love this recipe but i think it tastes even better if you replace the flour with banana multi purpose flour by pereg this banana flour is an amazing replacement for all sorts of recipes
these bars are better than banana bread very moist i add chopped walnuts and the bars go fast whenever i make them
these bars taste great i like to add 1234 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to the bar recipe in order to add extra flavor and some crunch i also prefer a thicker bar so i bake this recipe in a 13x9x2inch pan the icing is very good and a perfect addition to these bars
this was very easy and made a good quantity of delicious bars i had about 5 smaller sized bananas to use up and this recipe was perfect i threw in a little cinnamon amp candied ginger for added flavor like others i used a 15x9 pan glass increased time by 15 minutes and halved the frosting i also used a pineapple cream cheese in the frosting because i happened to have this available amp needed to use it up along with the bananas it proved to be an excellent choice for the frostingthe bars were moist and flavorful definitely a keeper
i have made these three times and they are perfect i substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour and added 12 cup of flaxseed meal i also cut the sugar in half and added 18 cup of honey finally i used reduced fat cream cheese my coworkers won39t know the difference
made these over the weekend and the bars were moist delicious and perfect to have with your morning coffee my husband took several pieces to work and shared a piece with his coworker and now the guy wants the recipe so his wife can make him a platefulthis recipe is definitely a keeper
my whole family loves this recipe including my son who may just be the pickiest eater i have ever know my only change was i had to use a 13x9 and add 15 minutes i guess with it being smaller the icing gets to be a little thick for my husband who doesn39t have much of a sweet tooth but i love it thinking about adding some spices and nuts once just for fun but definitely not necessary for this recipe
had a lot of over ripe bananas and needed a change from banana bread this is excellent even without the frosting
easy and goodwill make again
oh wow so easy and so tasty i made my first batch for my husbands work the next daywell it didn39t make it gotta make another batch this is a recipe i am sharing with my daughters
every time i make these delicious banana bars they get gobbled up so fast a great way to use use up ripe bananas and have a great desert i always half the amount of frosting because it makes so much
this was delicious shared it with my neighbors who also loved it will definitely make it again
i made this for the first time this recipe is a keeper i added 2 more bananas to the recipe just cooked a little longer my family loves it
i have made this recipe a million times and they are always a big hit i have also added walnuts to the batter for a nice addition
my family really enjoyed this i made it in a 9x13 pan because i didn39t have the right size so it came out cakey but was fine stored in the fridge tasted better cold to me and made it a bit more dense not as light and cakey
i did have to bake mine about 15 minutes longer than mentioned but sure worth waiting for delicious easy and a keeper thank you for sharing
taste real good but the frosting just a little runny
these are really easy and so delicious i only had a half sheet pan they were thinner than usual but still turned out great highly recommended
these bars are so good i had bananas to use up and my family loved these
my teenage boys gave this amazing dessert five stars even though i made it into a cake since i did not have a 15x10 pan took an extra 15 min baking time but well worth the wait the frosting mirrors our local bakery39s delicious frosting and now i cam make this at home the boys said they will avoid eating the bananas so i can make this again thank you for sharing
outstanding this is so easy and is a hit at every gathering my college age son begs me to bring to share with his housemates every time i visit
just made these today had to use two 8x8 square baking pans baked for 24 minutes turned out beautifully think i will cut the frosting recipe in half to save on calories and sweetness next time gets two thumbs up on deliciousness
i have been looking for this recipe these classic old fashioned bars are so good amp always a crowd pleaser
in my view 34bars34 are denser than cake i should have realized that with three eggs this recipe was going to be more cakey than barlike it tastes good but it39s not what i expected or wanted
i made these this weekend 42016 and they are delicious i didn39t change anything about the recipe and didn39t need to they would be good with walnuts in them or sprinkled on top of the icing
i39ve been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it i have shared the recipe tons of times
i made these following the directions exactly they were very good
my son loved these banana bars and has been asking me to make them again my husband thought there was too much frosting and scraped most of it off next time i will make less frosting or double the recipe and make 2 pans
my husband says this is absolutely the best thing i make
great another hit at the senior centerjust like the chocolate banana muffins made as mini39s i cut the sugar in half using 34 cup of brown and 14 cup of splenda also cut the frosting in half and still had left over frosting makes way to much unless you want as much frosting as cake
great way to use up those left over bananasthe cream cheese frosting is what takes these to the next level
these were amazing it was such a great way to use my brown bananas instead of making banana bread i will say it didn39t feel like a 34bar34 to me but more like a shallow banana cake it was a little dry to me but i may have over baked it the frosting was delicious amp the two combined were such a great treat i will make these again for sure amp try to make them a little better on my end such as not over baking great recipe
i was very surprised they were so good and they were easy
the best banana bars ever anytime i make these they are always the first thing to disappear even people who say they don39t like bananas and bakery made with bananas love them they are so quick and easy to make and it makes a large pan for sharing
i cut the sugar for frosting in half delight
my husband declared these banana bars 39very good39 they are also good with vanilla or lemon frosting
these bars are really good i have made them two times now within a week the first time i made as writtenexcellent but the frosting was a bit too rich second time i left unfrosted and they are just as good we have been adding a frosting of cream cheese a little confectioners39 sugar with whipped topping folded in to a few just enough sweet on top
34pretty good34i found if you make the banana mix and cover it and let it sit overnight the taste of the bananas just really pops frost the next dayalso it is so much easier to mix frosting if you let the butter and cream cheese sat to room temperture after frosting i stick it back in the fridge to set up just a bittook it to a church function and now have to make a copy for someone almost forgot it turned out better when i made it in a 9x13 and baked it for about 35 min compared to the 15x10
i made this yesterday just delicious i used a brown sugar icing instead of cream cheese as i don39t care for cream cheese icing it was so good
this is a great recipe added walnuts to top of frosting and left them off half of the cake and split with a couple of friends although i could have eaten the whole thing will definitely make again
i have made this recipe many times just as written everytime my grandson needs a desert for scouts he and often the scouts asks me to make these the frosting makes a lot but the boys seem to think the more the better when i make it for home i will cut it into squares and freeze them on a sheet pan when frozen i can then put them in a container on top of each other and the frosting doesn39t stick to the waxed paper
i am baking these banana bars now i used a 15 x 10 x 1 inch pan as directed jelly roll size the batter is overflowing into the bottom of my oven did anyone else have that problem
this is a great recipe easy and gone in a snap i add walnuts to the cake and on top of the icing a must is very ripe bananas one even over ripe for best flavor
i39ve made these 10039s of times because they are so good the only thing different i do is i sprinkle chopped walnuts over the frosting
wow these are amazing after reading the reviews i followed the suggestions of cutting back on the sugar to 1 12 cups and adding 12 cup of chopped walnuts i did not make as much frosting as the recipe called for and also cut back on the amount of cream cheese not a big fan this recipe is definitely a keeper
i made this cake for a family dinner of twenty five perfect with no nuts which some of the grandkids oppose and it was for a sheet pan it was so good everyone loved it perfect i will definitely use this recipe often
this is a great recipe my kids love it and it39s a fun treat instead of banana bread i39ve made it many times and the only change i39ve ever made has been to add toasted chopped nuts
delicious
i made these for a group of cheer coaches and judges at my daughter39s school what a hit they were moist and delicious and many came back for seconds and thirds the recipe was simple and a good choice
i used to make this recipe all the time and i had forgotten how delicious it was note if you freeze your overripe bananas be sure to drain them well before adding to batter
amazing
awesome recipe
no wonder why this is a 5 star recipe i39m so happy i tried it perfect for a crowd or to share with your coworkers
best way to use up overripe bananas very easy and quick to make and delicious
these are so so delicious the second time i made them i ran out of icing sugar and i only had about three cups and it was just as good if not better definitely recommend this one
a beloved recipe i lost my copy and was so happy to find this one mine come out every time quick and the frosting is so good
first time making these and they where a hit just followed the directions and they came out perfect will def be making these often
this is my go to recipe for a delicious dessert i follow the recipe and it always turns out perfect even the cream cheese frosting recently made these and there wasn39t even 1 left
followed the directions but the bars came out dry on the edges and raw in the middle the frosting came out really runny i even added more powdered sugar and it didn39t help after reading the other reviews i might try it again but cut the whole recipe in 12 so if it doesn39t work out i won39t be throwing away as much food and money i did this time i39ll probably lower the temp to and let it bake a few more minutes
i had a pan that was too short so the batter was deeper and i had to lengthen the baking time i was short cream cheese for the frosting and forgot the vanila and it still came out great very cakelike and moist awesome banana flavor a goto recipe to take to a gathering
this were so moist and yummy i think next time i make these i will throw in a handful of minichocolate chips i cut the icing recipe in half
so good
have made this again and again over the years i don39t change anything except i don39t make the full frosting recipe it is a bit too much great easy recipe
banana banana banana
my son loved this treat glad i cut back the icing sugar to 2c rather than 4c its a keeper for my recipe box
very yummy the frosting is good too but almost too much i added four large bananas to use them up and it turned out great very easy recipe
i39m going to repeat my review of a while ago don39t waste your time measuring the mashed bananas i39ve found three bananas works every timeand i dump the rest of the ingredients with the mashed bananas and give the beaters a few spins to mix it all together because the 34cake34 is sweet enough as is i never add the frosting and it39s never missed this is a nofail moist every time always praised recipe a professional wedding cake baker asked me for this recipe because she was going to replace hers for this one you will not be disappointed
this was easy to pull together on short notice and supertasty a great way to use leftover bananas
these turned out great and tasted terrificsuch an easy way to use leftover bananas
i love these bars i could eat the whole pan myself they are a nice change from pumpkin bars but they stay nice and moist and disappear quickly
love these so awesome
made a batch and brought to a school function for others to review and enjoy well liked by both kids and adults a few commented it may be nice to have the addition of toasted nuts or coconut topping also most said it tasted more like cake than a bar everyone enjoyed the frosting thougheven those who normally said they were not banana bread eaters will make again
i think i overcooked mine a little so i39ll watch it closer next time
love it love it love it and so did everyone else what else can i say
love love love i cut the sugar back to 1 cup and the confectioners sugar to 3 cups turned out delicious next time i39d cut the sugar in the frosting in half that would be sweet enough this one39s a keeper
yummy
just made this recipe and it39s simply d e l i s h super rich moist and sweet dhson l o v e i t
these are awesome i don39t like bananas but they were mashed so that was great i also added a 12 c crushed walnuts to the batter which was wonderful i will make these again
can39t count the times i39ve made this i like to make it for hubs to share with coworkers and have also lost count of the times i shared the recipe simple cake onhand ingredients very easy and super delicious can39t ask for more
this always go fast in my house easy to put together with ingredients typically one hand win win recipe
this recipe is a family favorite great way to use banana instead of making banana bread sometimes i just sprinkle it with powdered sugar it39s still yummy
my husband39s all time favorite he requests them often
i have made this recipe for years it is deliciousre one of the reviews this recipe is correct as written there is another recipe for frosted banana bars on the toh sitethat has 1 12 cups sugar and sour creamhttpswwwtasteofhomecomrecipesfrostedbananabars2
tasted great i used a 9x13 pan due to the small size of my oven so the sweet icing was a little overpowering but still good
this is so easy to makeand taste greati like it with out the frosting on it to
this makes a bigger batch than i thought not too sweet and great banana flavor
i have been using this recipe since it came out in the magazine many many years ago i39ve taken it to church for the 34after church social hour34 and it quickly disappears my husband loves it
best banana bars period i dare you to eat just one
i make this alottaste greatevery one loves itso easy to make
i made these banana bars a few months ago and they were fantastic i actually made banana bars a long time ago but i lost the recipe and so i was happy to find this one because they tasted like the ones i used to make i39m glad my brother was in town to help eat them up
i almost made this recipe but when i saw 342 cups of sugar34 stopped because that didn39t seem right sure enough i went digging for my old paper copy from the magazine and it was totally different 112 cups sugar plus 1 cup sour cream i39m sticking with the tried amp true
these are amazing
waaaay too tasty it was hard for us to eat just one bar this recipe is a keeper i was going to try several banana bar recipes but this one turned out so well there is no reason to try any more thanks for sharing
i have been making this recipe forever it is my favorite for ripe banana39s not as dry as banana bread my family loves it
i needed to use up some bananas that were in my freezer plus go to a potluck so thought this would be a great recipe to make however i made mini cupcakes instead of the bars they turned out great it yielded 60 minis and i baked them at 350 for 12 min i only made half the frosting and added that to some store bought cream cheese frosting that i already had in the frig and also only used 1 cup powdered sugar then i topped the cupcakes with toasted chopped walnuts needless to say there were no leftovers for me to bring home oh well guess i39ll just have to make more
very good i chunked some of the bananas instead of smashing them all i added a bit of almond extract to the frosting and sprinkled the frosting with honey roasted almonds
this is by far the best banana recipe i have ever made i make this for breakfast and dessert treats everyone loves it
there is something to be said for comfort food type desserts and this is one of them absolutely delicious and easy to prepare i made them for a baby shower and the gals loved them i really like that they are thinner and can be eaten with fingers instead of a fork the cream cheese frosting is perfectnot too sweet when my bananas get too ripe to eat i put them in the freezer and then pull them out to make these bars
i make this frequently both for dessert and for breakfast treats it always goes fast
these are the best banana bars i get asked to bake them often you can change up the recipe if you like but it is not necessary at all
excellent super easy one of my most requested desserts don39t measure bananasjust use 3 spotty ones it works every time i too use a 9 x 13 pan you won39t be disappointed with this one
my daughter and i just made these delicious i don39t have a 10 x 15 pan so i used a 9 x 13 and baked a little longer i halved the frosting recipe and i used low fat cream cheese with wonderful results i also added about 13 cup finely chopped walnuts we are throwing out our old banana bread recipe and replacing it with this
fabulous my dad loved these bars he said they tasted just like my grandmother39s now my children love them too
very good i used four medium sized banannas gave it a wonderful taste
i make these in a 9 x 13 pan and people can39t get enough of them they take a little longer to bake but i just adjusted to that i39ve made these in the 10 x 15 pan and they didn39t go over as well today i just finished making them int he smaller pan and added chocolate chips to themthey were extra special if you39re worried about the calories don39t bake them
my mom has made these bars in the 50es but did not use the cream cheese we frosted them with a home cooked marshmellow topping then a thin frosting
excellent love the cream cheese frosting
this has become a favorite family 34go to34 very deliciousnancyindiana
this is a great go to recipe for over ripe bananas been making it since 94
pdelicious extremely easy to make and the cream cheese frosting is divinep
this was wonderful very easy to make and the frosting was great everyone loved them thank youca
great quick to make and easy we loved them and will make them without hesitation next time i have to bring a dessert to pass

i made these bars instead of my usual banana bread and they were a huge hit i brought them into work and had to give out the recipe to save time use storebought cream cheese frosting
i made these for the first time for a funeral this past weekend i39ve had this recipe in my recipe box for years but have never made itthey were amazing i had more people than i can remember ask me for the recipe these were gone before everything elsethank you for a great recipe i will try all the other recipes from your magazine that i have had for years now too
i made these bars also and they are sooo delicious
i left the frosting off to shave off calories and they still tasted pretty good moist and fluffy
i39ve made these moist sweet bars a couple of times and my coworkers and husband are always excited to taste them excellent
this recipe holds up well even with nuts addedchopped walnuts added a little extra texture and worked out fabulously
pthese bars are so moist and flavorful i39ll be fixing these againp
i39ve made this recipe several times added a little more garlic because we love it it is always cleaned up not a leftover to be found thank you for sharing
i followed recipe and this wasn39t a hit with my partner the sauce just wasn39t there or so thin it just fell through the noodles to the bottom of plate the flavor was also just so so for me thinking maybe adding some cream and maybe a touch of dill right before the the breadcrumbs and cheese might have helped the flavor and thicken the sauce a bit
my husband loves this me too
my family loved this easy to make will make again
this should get 20 stars absolutely delicious amp easy to make i followed the recipe exactly with only one change since didn39t have a big enough oven proof skillet transferred it to a baking pan to finish the step for the oven thank thank you for this awesome recipe this is a classy restaurant quality dish amp keeper in my rotation this will also make a great appetizer served with a side of crusty bread
after reading the reviews i decided to double the sauce it was very good wouldn39t change a thing i did put over fettucine just because my family is not fond of the consistency of angel hair pasta will make again
really easy to make and tastes great i added some of the zest from the lemon for even more flavor
wife and i loved this
easy to fix taste great will fix again
very good shrimp next time i will probably season the pasta as well with some butter and parmesan before plating as there quite enough to really flavor the pasta for us
i had great hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews but we were very disappointed i made it for dinner last night and the only adjustments i made were to add white wine to produce more sauce but it was still far too dry and to top the pasta with the shrimp mixture before broiling we also thought it was very bland with the amount of garlic and lemon juice we thought it would taste better i39ve been thinking about how to improve it add lemon zest saute the shrimp in the butteroil instead of simmering in the liquid i39ve decided to use other shrimp scampi recipes instead the crispy broiled topping was wonderful so will try that with another recipe
i really liked this recipe husband and i have made this twice and both times cleaned our plates the lemon flavor is subtle and the shrimp cooked perfectly a keeper for sure
very delicious and super easy to convert to keto friendly i just didn39t add bread crumbs and it was still delicious i also substituted regular noodles with healthy 0 net carb noodlesand added a little cooking wine classic dish thank you
i really like this recipe before dinner my husband said he wasn39t very hungry but then he proceeded to clean his plate such good flavor i will definitely keep this quick and delicious recipe in my toolbox
great recipe i modified slightly based on other reviews i added a cup of white wine as the sauce does need a bit more also added in thinly sliced red onions lastly did not bother to broilwas fantastic
i made this to try to make us feel better about having a lonely covid no children or grandchildren christmas dinner it was delicious and so easy hubby hates lemon so i just made the garlic butter sauce and used thin spaghetti since we have angel hair pasta i will be making this many times
this is a fantastic recipe the flavors were so wonderful the only change we made was adding mushrooms but i can promise i will make this recipe for many years to come my husband gave my cooking a 5 star restaurant rating for this recipe enjoy we also used angle hair pasta
i made this on a whim after looking for a recipe to used leftover grilled shrimp it was amazing hours later i am still thinking about it reading some of the other comments i thought the amount of lemon was perfect tangy zingy mouth watering i39ll be making it again thank you
very good dish followed recipe except mixed pasta in before sprinkling with cheese bread crumbs and parsley
really good the lemon was a little overwhelming or it would have gotten 5 next time i3939ll use a lighter hand with it
i made this for a family gathering i was pleasantly surprised how easy and delicious it was
went camping needed a good scampi recipe for 2lbs i looked over many this is the one only added 14 white wine with lemon juice and cooked it in a frying pan instead of the broiler was absolutely fantastic plenty of great flavors very easy to make the zinger here really is the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese adds additional flavor and soaks up all the good stuff i will be putting this one in my dinner rotation
perfection quick easy and flavorful a win in this house
quick easy meal can be served over rice or pasta add a salad and dinner is ready my teen daughter prepared when i came home from hospital
this recipe was easy and full of flavor the only thing i did different was add a little white wine delicious
added a couple crab cakes to the breadcrumb and cheese topping lemon was perfect with that addition and will definitely make again
this has way too much lemon i haven39t tried it with reduced or zero lemon juice but i think it would probably be pretty bland it needs more garlic and something to give it a little zing granted though it was a very easy experiment
absolutely delicious doubled ingredients for 2 lbs on shrimp
a big hit delicious
delicious
uh ohi added 12 cup of breadcrumbs instead of the 14 cup called for in recipe the sauce turned out super think not really sauce exactly it tasted good is there anyway to salvage the sauce
what kind of white wine is best for this recipe
easy and quick using precooked frozen shrimp i used italian seasoning instead of oregano placing under the broiler gave it a nice texture i also used 1 lb of asparagus steamed and cut into pieces yummy
this recipe was spot on made for my birthday dinner and she absolutely loved it added shallot diced tomatoes and red pepper flakeswill definitely be making again
the flavors of this dish were excellent next time we39re going to add tomatoes and artichoke hearts to add a little color and veg
delicious i poured the shrimp and sauce over zoodles then added the cheese and panko instead of bread crumbs then put it all under the broiler will definitely make again
best recipe for shrimp excellent
this has become a recipe each wednesday night for our family to make it extra tasty we double the sauce and add white wine and do a pound and a half of shrimp to get more protein delicious
so delicious made exactly as recipe states it was amazing the whole family loved it
me and my family just love this recipe and my soninlaw who worked in many fine restaurants said it is one of the best shrimp scampi recipes he has ever had delicious
made accordingly to recipe loved it will make again
i followed the recipe as written i am not a big garlic fan so only used two clovesi sometimes use more shrimp this recipe is definitely one of my favorites
omg so delicious it tasted better than any restaurant dish i have had did everything as directed only change added salt and crushed red pepper flakes and some white wine we added the cooked pasta at the end and mixed everything together and it was beyond anything i have ever made wow
delicious as someone else said 34classic shrimp scampi34 i did deviate from the recipe at all except to add 1 extra clove of garlic but my husband and i are garlic lives and 5 cloves would be a little much for most people
this was goodi added chopped spinach and cherry tomatoes as i needed to use them up next time will broil the shrimp mix on top of the noodles it made a very pretty crusty presentation that had to be broken up when putting on the pasta also next time i will peel and detail the shrimp first
been searching for a really good shrimp scampi and this is it i followed the receipe but add diced onion i would add more shrimp but left over noodles were good too try it love it
printed
very good exactly as written flavor was really good and the recipe is very easy and fast i will definitely make again
very good and definitely will make it again a little too tart for me so not quite use all of the 14 c lemon juice
this is buddy valastro39s recipe with the exception of putting under broiler in my 62 years of cooking since 8 years old i have spent the last 2 years modifying my method to buddys this recipe takes it up a notch because of the broilingbetter for the bread crumbs i significantly increase the number of shrimps usually 2 plus pounds and increase the sauce it is classic shrimp scampi
this recipe really good i definitely make it again
love this recipe will never go back to my old way lots of flavor
incredibly tasty hubby and i made this today for the first time and loved it used crunchy italian bread crumbs doubled the butter and increased amount of cheese also added some frank39s hot sauce absolutely delicious thanks for this wonderful recipe
made this once before and found it to be very good i am making it today for easter dinner as there is only the two of us and wanted something elegant but delicious my only changes based on the first time is i will add a bit more garlic it all depends on the size of your garlic cloves some are small but some i buy are huge and i will add some white wine to the sauce also will double the sauce this time i plan on serving it over rice instead of the pasta that along with some steamed asparagus and rollsyummmmmm
i have made this 2x now and it is the easiest and most delicious shrimp scampi recipe i have had my boyfriend loves it a quick 30 minute meal
i have made this numerous times and it always gets a lot of complements restaurant quality my go to for a quick meal i would make extra sauce because the pasta absorbs it delishl
this was ok it needs double the sauce and half the parsley my hubby did not like it at all
so good i took the shrimp out of the sauce breaded it then broiled it added the sauce to the cooked pasta and after arranging the shrimp topped it off with more cheese family abusoluty loved it
i make this at least 1month my fiance has always been fond of red lobster39s shrimp scampi last time we ate there he thought scampi was bland i use slightly less lemon juice amp more cloves of garlic
this is by far the best shrimp scampi recipe ever made my family loved it amp be making it again
this recipe needs about a half cup of chicken broth or white wine to keep it from being too dry otherwise it is very very tasty
this may be better with a few changes little bland and too much lemon
this recipe was a hit we loved it
this dish with all it39s flavors is easy to make and absolutely delicious i think fresh parsley is a nice touch along with fresh lemons the only other thing i39ve added is white cooking wine and have gotten amazing feedback every time i make it and will definitely be serving this again
simple to make and everyone liked it
i have tried several shrimp scampi recipes over the years and this one is definitely the best we added some spinach after to the pasta after draining the water my husband and i agree that this was restaurant quality thanks for sharing
quick easy and so tasty i added a few fresh tomatoes chopped to the skillet with the garlic and it was yummy
we thought this was delicious this was my first time using a castiron skillet but it was just so easy the only thing i changed was that i used spaghetti instead of angel hair oh and i also used dried parsley instead of fresh i can understand why the one reviewer said it was 34dry34 but i don39t really agree there isn39t a traditional sauce but the lemon and butter definitely keep this from becoming dry even the leftovers were delicious we will definitely make this again
agreed with robby1 the sauce was good enough to double
why go to a restaurant when you can make this delicious shrimp scampi at home next time i will double the sauce so good and easy to put together
excellent recipe i made french bread to go with it and it was great for sopping up the juices
absolutely scrumptious without changing a thing highly recommend have to have again soon
stars still aren39t working right all are 39black39i39d give it a one star although hubby said he liked it won39t make it again was dry prefer my shrimp stirfried or coconut covered
this was amazing i39ve never had better even in a restaurant my son and i sat there moaning while eating it lol i highly recommend with no changes fab
excellent and is quick and easy to make
my husband loved it however it is rich
easy to make and delicious
i love the broiling with breadcrumbs for crunch but it did overcook the shrimp a bit overall this was awesome
this was a quicker version of shrimp scampi than my usual but was very tasty i add 14 c white wine to the sauce for additional flavor that we enjoy the crumb topping added a pleasant crunch as another reviewed has said take care not to overcook the shrimp i have also doubled the recipe for company and added 1lb bay scallops for a 34seafood scampi34 that is quite good we enjoy the texture of angel hair pasta with our scampi
delicious easy to prepare flavorful and loved by everyone just as a side note if you are serving this with pasta there is not a lot of liquid so you may want to add some for your pasta i used a splash of olive oil but some white wine or broth might taste good too
so quick simple amp good restaurant quality taste i used farfalle bow tie pasta amp it was perfect all the nooks amp crannies collected the crumbs amp garlic once the garlic is minced amp the shrimp is cleaned this dish comes together in 5 minutes i made this recipe as is but you could add a veggie or two it would be fabulous
i39m always looking for the perfect shrimp scampi recipe this might be it
delicious be careful not to overcook the shrimp though with sauteing and a quick broil it39s easy to do i will make again and will add a little white wine we did enjoy the added crunch from panko breadcrumbs
wow i am amazed that such a simple dish tastes so great
replaced the lemon juice with white wine i followed all of the other ingredients though came out great
this is a great shrimp scampi recipe it was super simple and delish i did add more garlic and lemon juice so good
best shrimp scampi recipe i39ve found i added an extra clove of garlic because we love garlic to create more sauce i added some homemade creamy tomato soup that i had on hand skipped the parsley it was heavenly
best we39 ve ever had absolutely delicious
i tried many shrimp scampi recipes this one is the tastiest of all i double the recipe just because i have all males in the house followed it to a 34t34 and it was great thank you so much for this wonderful recipe
excellent because of personal preference we39ll cut back on the amount of garlic next time the only other chance we made was to add a splash of white wine thanks so much for the recipe we39ll use it often
if i could give this recipe 25 stars i would this is by far the most amazing shrimp scampi recipe i have ever made and i39ve made many over the years i really feel this is the one i39ve been looking forhaving just read the review from 34happy1877734 i could have just put my review as 34dittops i will now stop looking for the perfect shrimp scampi recipe
being a new englander i have had some of the best restaurant shrimp scampi this recipe is by far the best i39ve ever had 5 star restaurant wonderful thank you
super simple and delicious
my my oh so good added some fresh asparagus while sauteing garlic by the time the shrimp were ready the asparagus was just right my husband said 34this is a do over34
made this with chicken tonight it was a hit nice fresh lemony fresh flavor easy to fix on a rushed night march 2016 made this again but with shrimp as it should be still a delicious and a good quick meal april 2017 rave reviews from family again
this is one of my all time favorites ive made this with both shrimp and with chicken when i have no shrimp in the house i fallow directions the same for both yes the shrimp is better then the chicken but its a nice change of pace for chicken it needs a tad more sauce for both chicken ad shrimp for us but thats easily taken care of
this was simple and delicious i loved the hint of lemon i used gluten free bread crumbs i served this over parmesan risotto i will definitely be making this again
just by reading the ingredients in a recipe i can decipher it39s caliberthis one is a winner thank you
excellent and so easy and quick perfect and will share and make again thank you
delicious and quick watch for bags of frozen peeled deveined shrimp to go on sale if you39re landlocked like me agree with use of some red pepper flakes for heat but add into the oil to flavor it can use white wine in place of lemon juice or combination of the two add a little bit of the pasta water to make more sauce without adding extra fat
i love shrimp scampi and i am a critic when it comes to good tasting food this recipe is awesome easy and flavorful the family love it this will be my 39go to recipe39 for shrimp scampi i highly recommend it
excellent easy and very flavorful i cut back on lemon juice as i am not a fan i used garlic flavored seasoned bread crumbs as i love garlic i paired with brown rice made with chicken broth but i can see if you were using pasta you would need to double the sauce will definitely make again
really good and i did double the sauce as suggested was perfect for me
i think i will double the butter and olive oil next time this was very tasty but i like a little more sauce for my pasta
amazing it was so easy to make and wowed everyone will definitely make again
this is an excellent shrimp scampi i would suggest go less on the lemon juice
i made this just as the recipe said and my husband and i loved it he loves angel hair pasta and even suggested i make this dish more often
i just had to have a little more substantial pasta and used linguine i could eat this stuff every day
this is the best version of shrimp scampi i have ever had this recipe is a keeper thank you lori packer for sharing this recipe the only thing i did differently is add a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes before adding the cheese bread crumbs and parsley
mom and hubby really liked it
i made this just as the recipe called except used a generous teaspoon of chopped fresh oregano because i have an abundance of it in my garden i also used the thinner fetticini noodles because my husband hates angel hair pasta the recipe was fabulous and will definitely be making this the next time all my children are home
i have been making this one for years and it is one of my favorites nice light version just the right amount of butteroil now if i can only get the price of shrimp down
this was a family pleaser howerver i did add more butter and olive oil to make a sauce for the angel hair pasta this was great with a salad and some french bread
my entire family loved this recipe and will definitely fix it again next time i am going to try putting the pasta in the bottom of the pan before broiling because it got cold before i finished the shrimp was making double the recipe and did it in two batches
my sister and brotherinlaw rated this recipe yum yum
we have made this several times over the passed several years after i found this recipe on here every time my parents visit or we visit them maybe twice a year they have me make this everyone one loves it including the picky toddler and hubby fixing it again tonight
this is very good
my husband loved it a little too much lemon juice though next time i will only do 18 cup instead of the full 14 cup overall very nice
this was great i didn39t put it under the broiler though i just mixed in the bread crumbs and the mixed with the angel hair pasta
this was supereasy to make and absolutely delicious why pay 15 a plate at a restaurant when i could feed the whole family this delicious meal for under 10
why did it take me so long to find this recipe it39s so simple to make and it tastes wonderful
a very simple and delicious dish the whole family loved it
wow this was really good i added halved mushrooms and used italian seasoning instead of parsley can39t wait to have it again
excellent will definitely make again added a side salad and glass of wine to complement the meal
omg i make this all the time it is wonderfull
awesome dish simple ingredients easy and quick but tastes divine recipe immediately bumped to my top 10 served with steamed broccoli and garlic bread
very good recipe may have to try adding white wine or more butteri39m thinking that the wine would be better delicious and very easy
i have been making a version of this for years to make the sauce stretch i add 14 to 12 cup of white wine my choice is a good chardonnay love the bread crumbs on top very glad i found your version
tried this dish tonight and i personally enjoyed it it was quick and easy another keeper
this was a great recipe i really impressed my motherinlaw when i made it for dinner i wish i would have made this when i still lived in florida key west pinks would have been even more amazing with this recipe
absolutely delicious i also added a little more butter and olive oil
delicious i made this exactly as written and we loved it one change that i will make next time will be to double the sauce ingredients to better cover the pasta
this is a favorite recipe the only change i make to it is that i mix up a package of alfredo sauce mix and add that to the pasta before serving with the scamp such an elegant dish that i serve to guests they will never guess it only takes minutes to prepare i have even made it for people who don39t enjoy seafood and watched them go back for seconds would highly recommend this recipe with the addition of the alfredo sauce
this has become a favourite recipe the only thing i change about it is that i make up a package mix of alfredo sauce and add that to the pasta before i top it with the scampi such an elegant recipe that i serve it to guests and they love it never guessing it only takes minutes to put together i have served it people who don39t like seafood and had them go back for seconds would highly recommend with the added alfredo sauce mix
loved the tastehad to make some changes for next timenot enough sauce will ad white wine use less lemon juice will use less bread crumbs thinks just a sprinkle across top to broil and brown is good enough also recipe did not mention pasta amount used in this dish i used a pound for 4 peopleaalthough i tripled the recipei love left overs also stored scampi seperately so that pasta didnot absorb sauce very easy recipe and quick to boot thanksa crowd pleaser served with salad and garlic bread with melted mozzarellajust yummy
yummy super easy a new family favorite
really the best recipe i39ve come across for shrimp scampi in years quick and easy too my family said that this will replace several of their favorite recipes even my lasagna
i have made this many times and it is always a hit excellent recipe
we loved this so easy did not use pasta just eat it with roasted veggies and salad will make again
simple and delicious we will definitely have this again next time i may try replacing the lemon juice with white wine
this was very good it was a fast and easy dish to make thanks
this was very good it was a fast and easy dish to make thanks
enjoyed the mix of flavors though i will use about half the amount of lemon juice next time only because i don39t really care for lemon flavor
children friends say it tastes as if it was ordered in the restaurant easy to prepare and every morsel is eaten i have also used chicken instead of the shrimp
family loved it made a double batch for 5 people and it was gone in one meal
very good and very simple i used about half the lemon juice a little more garlicso red pepper flakes and about 12 cup of white wine i was worried that adding the bread crumbs was going to soak up all the sauce i was wrong just sprinkling them with the cheese over the top no mixing than broiling for color and texture wasperfect put over noddles but would be great just as a scampi
i made this for my family tonight and they loved it it was the best i will definitely keep this one
i have been making this recipe for a few years nowit39s a favorite of the whole family the only thing i do different is adding alot more fresh lemon juice it really is great try it
excellent recipe and so easy i used asiago cheese because i didn39t have parmisian also used red pepper flakes instead of pepper omitted the bread crumbs after broiling i added the pasta and stirred to coat the pasta delicious
i use this recipe all the time so easy to prepare i also use scallops in place of the shrimp
forgot to add i especially liked the ease of the preparation so good and easy
loved it family loved it one child doesn39t like shrimp but loved the pasta dished out without shrimp usually make pasta with alfredo sauce but this is a much lower calorie choice
was good and definately quick and easy turned out a little too salty for our taste would probably cut back on the butter some next time otherwise good flavor and the bread crumbs and cheese make it better than the usual shrimp scampi
my family loved this recipe i did add more shrimp than called for because my three yr old loves them
agreed that it needed more 34sauce34 the 2nd time i made it i added a bit more olive oil and butter also used cooked small maine shrimp and it was so yummy it39s on its way to becoming a favorite around my house
my 12 year old son loves this delicious dish he likes the honey grilled shrimp better though
made for new years eve for the family and was a huge hit broiling it was what gave it that special touch will definitely make again
very quick and easyadded small scallops with the shrimpyummy
i omitted the bread crumbs and it was still delicious the lemon juice really brightens the flavor of the dish
very simple this was my first time making shrimp and it turned out perfect my family raved over it i served it as a side with a london broil and not with pasta delicious
savory has become a favorite with my wife and girls even my picky teenager
even my very picky daughter came back for seconds super easy recipe
this recipe is delicious my husband and two year old twins ate it up plus seconds after reading the comments i increased the amount of sauce by adding about 34 cup white cooking wine and only put about 14 cup of lemon juice i also upped the oregano and pepper to thicken it i added a tablespoon or two of sour cream i cooked the shrimp mixture with frozen shrimp and pasta on the stove and then put everything in a corningware baking dish to broil it with the bread crumbs and cheese on top i personally thought it needed more lemon juice and added it at the table but my kids and husband thought it was perfect without any addons it was soooo easy and i will make it again this will be a weekly staple meal in our house and did i mention that it39s pretty and good enought to serve to company
this was delicious my family raved about it for days
my family says this is a keeper hubby would have liked a bit more sauce over the pasta but otherwise it was perfect and sooo easy
this meal is absolutely delicious try using italian style bread crumbsyum yum
this meal was delicious i used white wine instead of lemon juice after reading the reviews it was soooo good yummy and easy
this was very delicious broiling it in the oven was a great idea
very good but i agree about the lemon it was too much
delicious however i also used less lemon juice and added a bit more olive oil next time i will try it with the white wine
this turned out great i forgot to click on the rating stars i would have given this recipe 5 stars
turned out great use extra shrimp a little more butter little less lemon and added bread crumbs to sauce before i added the shrimp i did not broil
this was absolutely delicious
this recipe was great the only change i made was halving the lemon juice and using chicken broth for the other half so it wouldn39t be so lemony i also added fresh basil in addition to the fresh parsley i did broil it which i agree added a nice touch my family is very picky and they all agree this one is a keeper
i substituted white cooking wine for lemon juice i used frozen cooked shrimp as it thawed the water from the shrimp mixed with the rest of the scampi sauce and made it the perfect consistency i did not broil it in the oven i made it entirely on the stove delicious
i agree with the lemon juice i just made it i did enjoy it however adding some white wine and subtracting some lemon juice would enhance the recipe i mixed the bread crumbs cheese and parsley together before adding to shrimp the broiling was a nice touch
this is something i would want to try except any good scampi has dry white wine without the wine it is flatgive it a try with the wine make sure you cook the wine off at least 10 minutes
i would substitute white wine for most of that lemon juice that39s way too much for a pound of shrimp
my family and i thought it had way to much lemon juice i suggest start out with 2 t first then add more to taste
hello we usually use scales in europe and the uk can someone kindly tell me how to measure the cups of flour is it scoop and level or spoon flour into the cup and level many thanks
did anyone else take more then 45 min for custard to set
these are the best bars i39ve ever made and tasted so easysuper delicious
i am always looking for a good rhubarb recipe and this one is so delicious i made these bars for friends for a memorial day cookout and they were a hit the tart rhubarb and the sweet topping are a perfect match i pulled them out of the oven and allowed to cool for about 1 hour before serving them warm with the creamy topping my husband ate one cold for breakfast the next morning i will freeze the rest for later
anyone know if you can freeze the bars and frost later when ready to use thanks
add 1 tbs cherry grand marnier or in place of the vanilla in the topping and drambuie to the custard for a nice twist
these are wonderful just as written or a tad more rhubarb i waited to write my review because i froze some as there is just the two of us and i wanted to see how well they were after freezing well after 4 months in the freezer they were perfect my husband said to be sure to keep this recipe and he doesn39t even like rhubarb
i make these on a regular basis and i follow the directions as is with just a bit more rhubarb
i need to halve the recipe some ingredients are easily halved but instead of 3 eggs use 2 also i measure flour by weight 5oz1cup so 7 tbls an odd way to measure flour is 238 oz level tbsp so halve that thanks for any thoughts
made exactly as recipe called they are delicious next time i will use fresh rhubarb and use more the frosting was so creamy my husband thought they were delicious also but would like more of the rhubarb thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe
nice one
these are so good i39ve been making it for 15 years ever since i found it my family loves them when rhubarb season is here they are made if i get really busy i use canned cream cheese frosting
i love these bars sometimes i add 1 cup of either raspberries or strawberries to the rhubarb to change things up they are delicious either way
tracy you can also use the following measure one cup of diced raw rhubarb equals 027 lb of raw diced rhubarb
tracy 1 cup of liquid is usually 8 ounces or 230 ml where as 1 cup of white granulated sugar weighs 7 ounces here is a conversion chart that you might find helpful this recipe is yummy but i would increase the rhubarb in the filling and decrease the whipping cream in the topping it was over baring
can anyone please tell me the weight of a as we use this measure in england
theses were fabulous i picked my rhubarb in the morning i made the 12 recipe more tart version and they were liked by all i agree that people who think they like rhubarb would love these so different
can these rhubarb bars be frozen after baking
very tasty i usually like rhubarb
so good the shortbread crust is a little labor intensive but worth making my new favotie rhubard recipe
i tried this recipe for the first time but it will definitely not be the last this has become one of my favorite rhubarb recipes it39s sweet creamy and a touch of tart the recipe is so easy to make i highly recommend trying this recipe
i have not made this yet but it sounds delish i have a lot of home canned rhubarb that is kind of like sauce how can i use that in this recipe
so yummy everyone i shared with asked for the recipe
this recipe is wonderful and a refreshing summer treat the first time i made this recipe i used fresh rhubarb but the second time it wasn39t available and had to buy frozen still in the process of making it but i39m sure it will be fine as long as it39s completely drained
absolutely delicious my kids loved them
these are fabulous simple to make and so delicious these have become a family favorite and requested often i now buy lots of rhubarb when it is in season and chop and freeze just for this dish
i made these exactly as written and they were amazing the recipe definitely makes a lot of them they39re rich so cutting them smaller is fine i took them to two different events this past weekend and they were a huge hit at both i39m definitely making these again
love love love this recipe but the topping makes it too sweet i make with either a meringue or drizzle a glaze on it fabulous recipe
delicious i made this once just as it is and it got such great reviews from my family that i put it in my recipe box i would suggest a very large 9x13 baking dish because it makes a lot i will try cutting it in half the next time a great way to use rhubarb
delicious i cut the recipe in half and put in a 9inch square pan i used almost 4 cups of rhubarb and i wish i would have used more the crust is nice and sweet and the custard really goes well with the tart rhubarb i didn39t have the ingredients for the topping so i just used whipped cream it was really tasty next time i am going to make the regular topping with the cream cheese and increase the rhubarb to 5 cups for a half size batch yum
i make this and my dad makes it we just don39t put the topping on it39s a big hit my dad makes one every week to take to local diner and they ask him to bring in more every time
i printed the recipe and noticed the crust calls for 1 cup cold butter twice and the filling calls for 5 cups of rhubarb twice you may want to review and redo the ingredients listed
absolute favorite in our home made this many times
i didn39t think i liked rhubarb until i tried this recipe yum
this deserves 10 stars
when i read this recipe i read the tips at the end and said to myself 34i have rosewater i39m totally doing that34 but then when i was creating the filling i forgot so i added it to the topping omg so good i had trouble getting it looking like pretty bars maybe i need to make it again i totally reccomend adding the rose water
very tasty but the crust was really rich when i make it again i would make it with a thinner crust base 1223
these bars are winners i substituted cool whip for the whipping creamstill great
everyone loved this recipe people raved about this even people that do not like rhubarb
oh so good
i would recommend this recipe as one of the best rhubarb bars
easy to make it was delicious
this is definitely a 5star dessert it is similar to my motherinlaws custard rhubarb pie so maybe that39s why we loved it so much
these were delicious i reduced the rhubarb and added some chopped strawberries because they are a great combination i also used an entire package of cream cheese in the frosting i think it helps it from being too sweet
these bars surprised me i liked them much more than i thought i would i made them for a support group i go to and i bake each month and i like to try something differenti think the next time i make these and there will be many more next timesi am going to increase the amount of rhubarb i think it can use almost double but i will start with 7 cups and see if it could still use morei did the custard part in my blender much smoother than whisking in a bowl once it was blended smooth i poured it into the same bowl the base has been mixed in then stirred in the rhubarbi did make 1 change to the frosting i used a full package 8 ounces of cream cheese i thought what the heck am i going to do with 2 ounces of cream cheese the frosting was great i do not think the extra 2 ounces mad a difference i did not increase the sugar or the cream and i can not imagine the frosting being any better than it was
i like strawberries and rhubarb together but wondered if anyone has tried this recipe with just strawberries or blueberries
my mom first introduced me to these bars years ago and i39ve since started making them so good i39ve even turned nonrhubarb eaters onto this bar love that they stay fresh in the fridge for many days
it was easy to make and very tasty i halved the crust and used 12amp12 instead of whipping cream and lessened the sugar i always do in desserts and it was very good i also had to bake it close to an hour thanks for sharing
i love anything rhubarb and had a lot to use this year i had to bake closer to an hour but the end result was very good will definitely make this again
i love anything with rhubarb but have to include strawberries i cut down the 5 cups of rhubarb to 4 and added 2 cups of chopped strawberries and used 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of just 6 everyone that has had them say they are beyond awesome
my favorite rhubarb recipe family and friends love it
i would describe this as a dessert you eat with a fork as opposed to a bar took a lot longer than 45 minutes to cook crust too thick but still very good
amazing recipe my husband and i visit this small amishmennonite restaurant and i always get their rhubarb custard pie this reminds me of that pie but so much easier to make to cut back on calories i omitted the frosting and just drizzled a very thin vanilla frosting over the top and i was happy with the result this will be my go to recipe from now on replacing the rhubarb custard pie i usually make thanks for sharing this
i made these today without changing a thingsimply decadent
best rhubarb recipe i ever tried
i have been saving this recipe to try for years and was so happy when i saw rhubarb at the farmer39s market last week these were delicious and i will be making them again
these are absolutely wonderful however i don39t call them bars i served them as a dessert on a plate with a fork too tall and soft to eat with your fingers although they are finger licking delicious rich yes yummy you bet
i made this recipe yesterday and the only thing i would do different from now on is to cut the crust ingredients in half i thought the crust was too thick
i love the filling of this recipe instead of the cream cheese frosting i make a meringue topping delish
this was amazing made it for easter today and loved it i cut down on sugar for both the custard filling and the topping and it39s perfect will definitely make this again
mjfusa you could use half amp half or whole milk instead anything lower fat and you39ll risk the texture of the custard
i made this yesterday for dessert at a pot luck dinner of 14 people everyone loved it and commented that it was very satisfying and not too sweet
is there a possible substitute for the cups of heavy whipping cream too rich for my family need to tone it down a bit
whoever came up with this recipe is an absolute genius they are very rich otherwise they would all be gone in no time at our house
these are so good they have moved into the favorite category i don39t change anything
absolutely delicious rave reviews from everyone
cool one
my family loves this recipe i get asked for the recipe where ever i bring this dessert i use the whole 8 oz package of cream cheese and cool whip instead of whipped cream
these were very good i agree with some of the other reviews that there is too much crust and i would make more of the filling i liked them better without the frosting but that is my personal preference not because the frosting wasn39t good
my family loved these bars i wish i would have halved the recipe and cooked in a 9x9 or 8x8 pan these bars are very rich
has anyone tried making these up to the frosting step and freezing them just wondering if that would work then thaw amp put the ream cheese mixture on then
i had been wanting to make these bars for some time and i39m so glad i finally tried them they are outstanding i cut the recipe in half for the two of us and baked them in an 8x8inch pan i also added a sprinkling of nutmeg my grandma always did that with her rhubarb desserts i can see why this is a top ten rhubarb recipe and dessert recipe i will definitely be making these delicious bars again
i39m pretty sure these bars changed my life
this is the first review i have submitted these bars are the best rhubarb dessert i have had i will continue to make these i did not change anything in this recipe
i39m so used to boiling rhubarb i didn39t read the recipe first mine had rhubarb disributed evenly through them and they tasted very good too i won39boil them next time i make this
these were absolutely delish i love strawberry rhubarb pie so i cut the rhubarb to 4 cups and added 2 cups of strawberries i used fresh rhubarb and fresh strawberries i think frozen would have added too much moisture there is a lot of sugar but it was worth it next time i39ll use whipped cream and lose the extra 12 cup of sugar also 36 bars from a 13x9 baking dish makes them more like cubes if you are counting carbs 1 34bar34 is more like 70 carbs
these bars are awesome the rhubarb taste is lovely i did cut back on the amount of sugar in the filling but just because i like it a little more tart i am going to try cutting back about 14 on the base ingredients just so it is not quite so thick thank you for a great recipe we will be enjoying these often
these are very rich but very tasty i39m not a fan of the cream cheese so i leave the cream cheese out and top with the sweetened whip cream with a touch of vanilla i leave out a little of the sugar from the topping
i made these today for my birthday treat i thought they were great the whole family gave them 5 stars they were worth the little extra time it took to make them
i made this recipe and took it to work everyone loved it this is a keeper
so disappointed lots of work beautiful resultsvery bland in taste
delicious the shortbread crust is easy to make the filling moist and the rhubarb adds just the right amount of tanginess i will definitely make this recipe again perhaps even using different kinds of fruit instead of rhubarb
fabulous dessert for a recent dinner party i added nutmeg to the shortbread crust and as others suggested 6 cups of rhubarb yes it makes a lot and if i were preparing it for a smaller amount of folks i would halve the recipe
great bars i also use sliced canned or fresh peaches and sprinkle chopped nuts on top i don39t frost mine
love these bars fantastic used 6 cups of rhubarb
delicious great old fashioned dessert that my grandkids really enjoyed
love it i made it as shown and everyone loved it but wanted a little more of the rhubarb i will use 6 cups rhubarb next time
these were wonderful i did add more sugar to both the crust and filling but didn39t frost the bars
this is a great recipe nice and creamy the rhubarb is very mellow and the topping is not too sweet this will go into my keeper recipes i made the recipe exactly as is and didn39t make any changes
wonderful recipe even those who don39t like rhubarb like this dessert
my new favorite rhubarb recipe
yummy
these bars are dangerous
very good
i added a tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of cloves to the rhubarb next time i39ll add even more very good
very good but for a crowd
these bars are one of the best things i39ve ever tasted i39ve switched up the fruit too equally delicious
so so delicious my 7 year old says it39s her favorite dessert ever she loves it more than birthday cake even
best rhubarb dessert ever we are not really rhubarb fans but in honor of my grandfather39s rhubarb plant which each of his grandchildren keep growing in our yards been around for a good 80 years now i try to make something every year well this year i have made this recipe six times already it is absolutely delicious the shortbread crust and subtle custard filling are sublime if you love rhubarb this will be your favorite recipe and if you don39t it still might be your favorite dessert recipe
yummy first batch went so fast i had to make another immediately both times i just realized i failed to bake the crust and it obviously turned out great anyway the 2nd time i wanted more custardy filling so added 14 cup milk too we had a housefull of people so it makes enough i will be bringing this to potlucks for sure it certainly was not bland we used freshly picked rhubarb we all loved the shortbread crust i feel this was an easy recipe and quick but then i had my rhubarb already cut and didn39t bake the crust before adding the filling it tastes more custardy when eaten warm it sets up a bit when chilled it would be yummy even without the topping i am sure a big hit here
fabulous my family asks for this rhubarb is the key ingredient here i mix the sugar amp flour amp rhubarb more like 6 cups chopped very fine and let it set while i prepare the other parts when making the cookie bottom i don39t press it down real tight for sure don39t overbake the bottom it39s better to eat it like fall apart cake than to have it overcooked amp dry ask me how i know smile also bake it in glass not metal i love jaslyn39s suggestions amp i plan to try them but this recipe is great as is it tastes great warm out of the oven and cold the next day oh and it makes a lot it could easily be halved and one more thing i have been making these bars since the recipe was first published in the magazines in 1988 i just never added a rating taste of home fan here
this is a very yummy way to use up some rhubarb i added some cinnamon and nutmeg into the custard part of the bars and cut the sugar just a tad i also used a whole brick of cream cheese and more like 15 cups of heavy cream for the whipped cream part of the topping and i think next time i will just double the topping part altogether it is so good all in all this recipe is a definite keeper next time i will also up the sugar in the crust just a smidge as that part still needs 34something more34
i first tasted this at a potluck dinner it is wonderful
pthe bestp
meh i agree with another user that this recipe is quite bland not very sweet when you bite into the bars there is a beautifully creamy fluffy texture but not much flavor the crust is the best part i think tastes like shortbread cookies the custard section seems to be missing something this recipes was really a lot of work i do not plan to make these again
so easy and absolutely delicious
loved these next time i will try to have the rhubarb chopped ahead of time otherwise they were a fairly quick to make desert i did add walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe they were a big hit
made these with strawberries and rhubarb and they came out great can they be made with any other fruits rhubarb is not available long enough and i don39t have a freezer
i haven39t made this yet but i love rhubarb so will be making it soon and i39m pretty sure it will rate 5 stars
these are great everyone loved them
i made this for a family reunion and it went over very well recipe is definitely a keeper
the bars are alright but nothing special i used just one cup of sugar in the filling and it turned out fine i think the crust is too thick the topping doesn39t add much to the recipe and i think it is unnecessary
made these tonight very good when i was at the store getting stuff for this i did not read it carefully when it came to the cream cheese i grabbed two 8oz pkgs but i did notice it before i made the frosting just used one 8oz pkg turned out great i was too eager to frost and eat the bars so the frosting got a little warm and melty but after putting it in the fridge everything turned out great easy recipe and very delicious also the crust was good did not think it was too thick
very good i followed the recipe as written the crust could have baked about 34 minutes longer but that may have been my oven i took this to a potluck without having made the recipe before that39s always a gamble i received numerous compliments and a few requests for the recipe telltale vote was in the fact that i took home an empty pan the bars were sweet but the tartness of the rhubarb balances it out and dessert was light tasting i also appreciated that real whipped cream and not artificial topping was used it gave the bars a richer taste than the artificial plastic tasting topping would
awesome
wonderful and lots of rhubarb
i have always loved the rhubarb torte my mom always makes but not a fan of meringue in which i took off this recipe tastes just like her torte except for a light fluffy cream cheese frosting my new favorite
this is the best rhubarb recipe i have ever made love it
made this for a graduation party and everyone loved it instead of 5 cups of rhubarb i used 3 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups of chopped strawberries i only used about 14 cup of sugar to the topping and both pkgs of cream cheese the not so sweet topping offset the sweet center plan to use this with straight strawberries then blackcaps and follow it up in late summer with peachesi think they will all be awesome new keeper recipe
i made these for a memorial day get together everyone loved these bars but i used 8 ounces of cream cheese
a new favorite expect for the topping i used 4 ounces of cream cheese 12 powder sugar 1 tsp vanilla beaten together and then 1 8 ounce cool whip folded in yummo
haven39t made these due to the huge amount of cream in both filling and frosting has anyone made them with half and half in the filling
this was great at our mother39s day bbq it got rave reviews from everyone
my first rhubarb dessert for this season the crust and the filling were wonderful the topping was good but there was way too much of it i only put half of it on and it was still over powering one package of cream cheese would have been plenty family suggested we just use cool whip next time so we could taste the rhubarb i will make again thanks for the recipe
these were great
i wasn39t paying attention and did not have any heavy cream and thought the cream was suppose to be in the bars i used vanilla greek yogurt in the filling and about 8 ounces of cool whip in the frosting these bars turned out excellent
sounds like a wonderful recipe but can i substitute fresh strawberries i don39t have rhubarb on hand and the store is 40 miles away
absolutely amazing i begged for the recipe last year after having one at the horse show food stand
oh this is very similar to my favorite pie recipe for rhubarb rhubarb custard pie only that recipe has some nutmeg in it i think i39m going to give this a try since it only gets rave reviews too
i made this recipe after reading all the great reviews i was very disappointed in these bars all the butter and whipping cream overpowered the rhubarb there is way too much crust for this recipe half the amount would be much better also since these bars have to be stored in the fridge the chilled crust ended up being hard would not make these again i39ll save my rhubarb for recipes where the rhubarb can really shine
i have been making this every year when the rhubarb is readythis is the only rhubarb recipe i make it never disappoints even the finickiest rhubarb eaters love iti should say that i still have the original recipe from the 1998 toh magazine that39s a long time to make over and overtry it you won39t be dissapointed
outstanding i used frozen rhubarb that i had thoroughly squeezed out it came out so great that i don39t think i39d want to take a chance using 34raw34 rhubarbwould it set as well would it release too much liquidi39m already thinking of other things to sub incan you imagine this with plump rumsoaked raisins oh my goodnessi wouldn39t change anything else about this recipe it39s simply perfect and it comes together very easily
delicious
i39ve made this recipe a few times and got rave reviews i get requests for this all the time
i mixed rhubarb and fresh blueberries together and added alittle cinnamon to the custard yum is all i can say i have made them with just rhubarb for 12 years
the best rhubarb recipe you will ever taste
everyone who has eaten these bars just loves them even if they are not fans of rhubarb very good
these are awesome i have made these for several years and i always get complimented on them and asked for the recipe
made this for a potluck and it was a hit definitely will make it again yum
this recipe is hands down my all time favorite that i got from taste of home over the past 12 years i have substituted fresh blueberries blackberries and raspberrieseach to die for everyone and i mean everyone loves and requests these
again and again and again
i make these bars every year when my rhubarb is ready i am never disappointed
i make these bars every year when my rhubarb is ready i am never disappointed
i absolutely loved this recipie
definately a keeper not to sweet just perfect the texture was nice my frosting was way runnier than what is pictured i will decrease the whipping cream next time
these are to die for i sometimes use cool whip for the frosting instead of heavy cream in hopes of cutting calories i dare not make them too often since i can39t stop eating them heavenly
these bars are delicious next time i make this i won39t add the full cup of cream to the topping as i found it softer than what i would like
i love this recipe and i make it every spring as soon as my rhubarb is ready to be picked i added 2 cups of fresh sliced strawberries and an extra tablespoon of flour to the filling
i found this recipe awhile back now it is a must to make a few times during the growing season my family loves this it is nice change from the regular recipes i have found
these are the best rhubarb bars
these are wonderful and we enjoy them without the topping delicious
oh my gosh these were so good our family loves rhubarb and this recipe just went to the top of my list be sure to have the recipe handy when you serve these as everyone will ask for it
this is such a delicious recipe for rhubarb ymmy one of my favorite spring time recipes
these bars were really good the crust is very tasty it39s also good without the topping i added 2 tbs strawberry gelatin to the filling mixing in with the sugar amp flour
i took this divine dessert to work this weekthe girls loved it and wanted the recipethey didn39t even want to share with other departments the pan emptied fast
i make these every spring soooo good
delicious creamy and moist dessert love the topping
i39ve also been making these bars since they first came out in the magazine they are outstanding creamy rich with a wonderful texture loved by young and old they are even requested for birthdays
i first made these bars a few years ago and they became an instant favorite of my family39s these are the best bars ever
i love these bars and so does everyone who has tried them one lady ate the whole pan over the course of a couple of days and then about died when she say the fat content in them my sisinlaw who swears she doesn39t like rhubarb loves them as well i39ve been making them ever since the recipe came out and will continue to make it
just love these bars they have to be my favorite way to use rhubarb
great barshave been making these since they first appeared around 1999 in the taste of homemag recipe section
so delicious will definately make these again
have made these for years but in a jelly roll pan they get thinner amp its become 1 of our top 2 rhubarb favorites everyone always asks for the recipe
has anyone tried freezing it and then thawing it for later use
why is the batter runny made it just like it says room temp eggs soft cream cheese is it not enough sugar added the half cup like recipe says
i have made this many times but i cook it on my smoker it will cause a fight over the last piece
i can39t rate because i haven39t made it yet but it looks absolutely delish has anyone tried making it in a rectangle pan and cut into bars what size pan and how long to bake
need to bake longer watch until golden brown and set too good
i made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit not overly sweet like a pecan pie sometimes is i used caramel topping it fat free otherwise followed directions with the exception of time i read another review that said to bake longer and i did about 810 minutes it was awesome neat how the syrup moves to the bottom under the cheesecake i love that magic anyway super easy with limited ingredients and great taste just add a little more time like the other review said jiggly on top in the middle should be fine
i have found out a few things making this recipe 1 use ice cream topping i used smuckers and not syrup the syrup set up 2 it needs to cook about 15 minutes longer than the recipe says always delicious and a new favorite
i find this recipe my new go to everyone loves it if you read the reviews saying it was a runny messdon39t be alarmed my first one was too there is nothing wrong with the pie if you get a runny mess try again because you didn39t cook it long enough that being said even though my first one was a runny mess i was still asked to make it again i39ve had luck adding 10 mins to the cook time give or take it should still move in the middle slightly but it shouldn39t be too jiggly it39s tough to tell with this one when it39s done when you get it right it39s amazing
well now i have made it and it only gets 1 star it really doesn39t deserve a star at allvery disappointed followed the recipe to the t refrigerated over night cut into it today and its nothing but a runny mess i still tastes 34okay34 but i will from now own stick to my karo syrup half light and half dark pecan pie recipe that always comes out perfect mike
followed the recipe exact refrigerated this overnight and when i cut in to it the next morning to serve with coffee it literally ran the inside never set and it turned out soupy not at all what i had expected and i can tell you that it was a complete waste of ingredients threw it in the garbage and i will not waste the time or ingredients again especially with the cost of pecans
easy and delicious will make during holidays
please update the ingredients list the directions include cream cheese which is not listed in the ingredients
you can not see all the ingredients needed for this recipe on a phone not sure about a computer since i have ones
you did not include cream cheese in the ingredients recipe fails
wait to try this with sugar substitute looks so yummy and easy as 123
i made this delicious pie for christmas this year it was a big hit with the whole family
i made this pie for christmas dessert and it was delicious so easy to make and a time saver i made no changes to the recipe
i made this for our thanksgiving and was so good made it again two days later to take to a second dinner invitation will permanently be on our thanksgiving menu
absolutely delicious i made this dessert for thanksgiving and my family insisted i make it for christmas only change i made was making graham cracker crust versus pastry crust so easy and sooo good
awesome delicious and so easy to make i took it to a christmas party and they had a contest for the best dessert i won everyone loved it
the bomb loved it so much making 2 for christmas company
easy to make and sooo good i increased the cheesecake mix by 12 to make a thicker layer of cheese cake and put it in a deep dish pie pan it was a hit and didn39t last long it was the first dessert to disappear on thanksgiving
so easy to make and so good i will definitely make this again i didn39t have the fatfree caramel on hand so i used the regular caramel ice cream topping and it was perfect
made this for thanksgiving 2019 and it was delicious easy to make it was definitely a hit on the dessert buffet will be making again for christmas
outstanding recipe i used a bought deep dish crust for the ease and salted caramel topping i tried it out on my neighbor and this is definitely a keeper recipe
this is one of my favorite dessert recipes i39ve made it many times and it is always a hit it is so simple yet tastes so delicious and is perfect for potlucks or to bring as a special treat when bringing a meal to a friend i even brought it once as a 34thank you34 to a neighbor and they were thrilled i39ve used different brands of the caramel ice cream topping and have also used regular not nonfat it39s always delicious
this was fantastic came out just like the picture make sure to use caramel toppingnot syrup i only used 2 lg eggs with the caramel and didnt use all of it there is no need to drown the pecans in sauce just enough the cover them cooked using a ceramic 934 pie dish at with alluminum foil tented loosely for 40 min then removed foil and cooked an additional 20 min
the recipe is easy to follow and incredibly delicious this pie will be on our thanksgiving table again this year
just wondering does it have to be fat free topping
this desert was absolutely delicious followed recipe directions and came out perfect i made a few modifications such as used 3 eggs instead of 4 baked at 350 degrees and baked for 35 minutes no more i also used nilla wafer crust scrumptious
haven39t made this pie yet but was just wondering if anyone has tried making this with salted caramel because they were out of the smuckers caramel topping at the store please help just want to make sure i won39t ruin it
very delicious and was a huge hit with the family
this is absolutely delicious i made it last year for thanksgiving then again for christmas looks like a new tradition is born i make it with graham cracker crust
this is super delicious
made this awhile back but forgot to rate easy dessert to make and came out looking just like the picture it39s very good but super rich
haven39t made it yet but it looks so delicious and i just have to give it give stars because my husband loves pecan pie and i love cheese cake so this just may be out new favorite thanks for the recipe
i hosted a pie party and this was th pie that i baked it was so delishous everyone was asking for the recipe to this day my friends still request this scrumptious pie
regarding andrews89 if it was eggy and lumpy it39s possible your oven runs hotter than the dial get an oven thermometer and check the temperature settings it39s also possible you didn39t beat the cheesecake mixture long enough check out those things and try again
i39ve been making a pie like this since the 8039s except it39s called mystery pecan pie and has no caramel in it it is delicious
very easy to make looks like the picture will make again
did everything just like the directions said i was extra careful to watch my time too as to not burn or over cook accidently but it just dint come out quite right the cheesecake part dint have that classic cheesecake velvety taste to it more eggy and lumpy not sure what i did wrong
i was very intimidated it was my first time making something from scratch i made it on thanksgiving my whole family loved it and they were very disappointed on christmas when i made something else it really is a hit and it39s so easy to make and i bought all the ingredients to make it again
excellent to the other reader that mentioned about the caramel layer on bottom when a cream cheese went down first mine ended up with a caramel layer on the bottom so it must separate itself it turned out looking exactly like the photo and tasted as good as it looked
delicious pie i don39t really care for the standard pecan pie but i really enjoyed this as did my family and guests i followed the recipe and no problems of any kind used graham cracker crust to save time excellent
question does the pie separate into layers as it bakes the pix shows a caramel layer on the bottom but the directions say put the cream cheese mixture in first
this is a favorite when i take it to church dinners i make it for 2 friends on their birthdays instead of cake
this recipe is great the pie smells as delicious as it tastes i will definitely be making this one again i put it in a graham cracker crust and it was off the wall i do however have a couple tips to the people who claim the pie was too runny or eggy when mixing the cheese filling make sure you beat it smooth as the instructions say it may take quite a bit of doing considering you are dealing with cream cheese especially if it isnt softened completely make sure there are no chunks left and that it is nice and whipped the same goes for the caramel topping i also only used 2 and a half eggs instead of 3 in the topping mixture let the pecans swim but dont drown them i didnt completely use the entire topping mixture on mine finally make sure your cheesecake is completely baked to the middle and make sure you cool and refridge the pie for the proper amount of time
i made this today to share with some friends and everyone loved it the only change i made was that i substituted homemade brown sugar caramel for the store bought topping its the 34easy caramel sauce34 on the pioneer woman site and it literally only takes five minutes to make just make sure to let it come to room temperature before letting it touch the eggs and keep it a little on the runny side it will thicken a bit as it comes to room temperature and you don39t want it too thick when you mix it with the eggs the pie was great a perfect blend of several wonderful tastes and textures i give it five stars
i followed the instruction exactly as written and it was honestly the worst dessert iand39ve ever made i was embarrassed when i sent it with my husband for his cookout and he told me it was awful i tried it and i threw out the entire thing 6 pieces left i wish i could give it 0 stars
easy to make and so good the first pie to disappear at thanksgiving this year everyone loved it
my pie seemed a little eggy what size eggs did you use i also had to bake 15 min longer to bake the center
i made four pies for this past thanksgiving weekend to be served with three different gatherings husband39s family my family and our church family each location this pie was an absolute hit and everyone wanted the recipe i saved a wee bit of time and used marie callender39s frozen deep dish pie crusts they worked beautifully but do note they are 8oz crusts and not 9oz i wasn39t able to use all the caramel mixture on the pie in fact 3 caramel mixtures were plenty for the 4 pies it didn39t affect the taste at all this pie was amazing even my nondessert eating husband tried some and really liked it
this was a hit at thanksgiving everyone loved it i poured only about 34 of the carmel on the pie and i wish i hadn39t next time i39ll use the whole jar
by far my favorite pie ever follow the instructions to a 39t39 you will not need to change a thing it has become the most requested dessert at our family holidays over the last few years
this is truly an excellent dessert one bite and you will be hooked
this is a terrific recipe i have made this numerous times for various occasions and it is always the quickest to disappear it has consistently been great every time thank you so much for sharing this recipe
made this for a pie contest at work went over really well not as sweet as i thought it would be which suited me fine don39t like overly sweet things will definitely make it again
amazing on every level no need to bother with the fat free stuff
does it actually have to be sugarfree caramel topping or will reg smuckers work i want to try it for thanksgiving
this is the best pecan ever my husband always wants pecan pie for his birthday and after i made this one it is the only he asks for everyone in family loves this pie we give this pie 10 stars easy to make and always turns out great
this pie was such a hit at thanksgiving that i decided to make it again for christmas i did and the results were disappointing to say the least neither pie set correctlythey came out unbelievably runny then i stumbled across a review of this recipe from jiminy97 on feb 03 2012 they had the same results as my christmas fiascorunny pies the only thing we did alike was make 2 at the same time my guess is 34for best resultsprepare 1 pie at a time34 should be added to the recipe
this recipe omg good it was a big hit for my christmas dinner this year i will make this again and again o
this is so easy and taste awesome not too sweet
i have made this 3 times since finding the recipe a little before thanksgiving for the time invested it is delicious tastes like you spent forever in it yummy
very easy recipe the taste was excellent made it for friends and they loved it i didn39t use a deep dish pie crust i used a graham cracker pie crust because its my fav with cheesecake and pecan pie because i didn39t use a deep dish pie crust i used less caramel than the recipe called for maybe 23 of it was used my pie still came out like the pic and maybe even better the one problem i did have with the recipe is the timing to leave the pie in the oven the recipe stated 35mins but my pie was still not done in the middle so i left it for an additional 15 mins or so and it came out perfect with the golden brown crust yummy
quick easy delicious puzzling how the caramelegg mixture sinks to the bottom during the baking it was the hit of my 2012 thanksgiving feast
do you think i can make this with a spring form pan i dont have a pie dish
everyone in my family absolutely loves this pie and they request it every year the first time i made it i used the wrong kind of caramel so the layers didn39t work but it was still good just make sure to double check your caramel before using it super tasty
so delicious i used a frozen deep dish pie shell and baked it on a cookie sheet came out perfect theresa
it looked just like the picture and tasted just as good this one is a keeper
absolutely delicious
oops didn39t realize i39d already rated this
this is soo quick amp easy my 8yr old can make it took it to a family gathering everyone raved about it and i had to share the recipe will never make a traditional pecan pie again
absolutely the easiest desert to make my 8yr old could do it also so delicious that i will never make the standard pecan pie again took it to a fall hayride and everyone wanted the recipe sooo glad i tried this one
this is east to make and the taste is devine
this pie is extremely tasty but a bit too sweet for me my family loved it my only complaint was that it was a bit watery maybe it39s just me
my pie did not turn out as expected was very disappointed i39ve gone over the recipe many times as i was sure it was something i did wrong but i just can39t figure out what it was i made 2 of these pies for christmas and had to throw them both away i read the reviews and the caramel sauce is supposed to sink to the bottom but how does sauce with 3 eggs in it sink it turned out like terrible caramel scrambled eggs on top i39ve baked before and really can39t figure out how everyone else can make it come out right but mine was so terrible we couldn39t eat it
zowie this is one amazing combo pie delightful
i used a deep dish frozen pie shell and baked it for 45 minutes it came out perfect everyone loved it note for my first try i used a regular sized pie shell and only 23 of the topping would fit but it still came out great with compliments
excellant tasting and easy recipe one of those where you don39t realize how wonderful it is until the last bite i did have tp add an extra 10 minutes to get the middle done absolutely beautiful to look at
rave reviews for this pie sooo good
this is very deliciouswe all loved it made for thanksgivingand planning to make again christmasif you like pecan pie and cheescake this is both all wrapped up togethertry it
made for thankgiving this yearmy boys loved it will make every thanksgiving along with the sratch pumpkin pie
easy to make yet looks like you spent hours slaving in the kitchen rich tasting yet not too sweet
five stars are not enough for this one made it with the ice cream topping but i39m wondering if it would also work with the caramel apple dip i always seem to have onhand has anyone tried substituting that
this is a great recipe i made it for thanksgiving this year and it was a hit with the extended family it looks like a pecan pie until you cut into it it tastes terrific we gave a pie to our neighbor and she requested the recipe so that she could make it for her family too
wonderful recipe i made this for my thanksgiving dinner and it turned out fabulous i used a graham crust rather than a regular pie crust as my family prefers it it was a nice change from makng the traditional pecan pie
delicious easy i am going to try a pet ritz pie shell this next time i did cook the pie a little longer then suggested as i wasn39t sure how the center of the pie should be before taking it out any suggestions
to coloradolimei would certainly think you could do this in a 9x13 pan i make my pumpkin pie recipe and bake in a pyrex cake pan it comes out beautifully and is actually more healthy without the crust
this was such an easy recipe to make almost foolproof and makes such a beautiful presentation when cut people came back for seconds and my pie was gone in a flash no leftovers the cheesecake layer rises to the top the caramel sinks to the bottom and the pecans float to the top just like the picture i topped with extra caramel i used hershey39s caramel syrup and my pie was not runny at all just like the picture
followed instructions running in the middle and from a pie lover was one of the worst i ever made
this was so yummy everyone raved about it and had to have recipe
this looked so good but turned out runny in the middle even though i baked until golden brown per the recipe did anyone else have this problem
my pie didn39t set upfollowed instructions to a teebut we ate it with a spoongreat flavor
this is one of the best pies i39ve made and always am asked for the recipe
everyone enjoyed the flavor of this pie next time i will make my own crust
i made this for thanksgiving and not only was it easy to make it was so good it was nice to serve something traditional with a twist
made this todaytaste really good reminds me of the pecan pie except not as sweet will be repeating for christmas
this was part of our thanksgiving last yr 2010and it definately will be included again this yearadded 3oz more phila neuchatel lofat and used 12 cup eggbeaters and 2 eggs instead of 4 eggs it was delic and more healthy and it was super easy to makemade it tues nite for thanksgivingday it sat in refrig to enhance the flavors
has anyone ever tried making this recipe in a large baking dish and cutting into bars i39ve got a crowd to feed and think that might be a better way to serve it wondering if it would hold up the same way
if you like pecans caramel and cream cheese you39ll love thisit39s sure to be a hit
how easy to make and so delicious my sister loved it and now wants me to make it instead of the traditional cheesecake i make
this pie is super simple to make and it is a definite crowd pleaser i have made it for thanksgiving 2 years in a row and it will be a tradition from now on
this pie s fantastic i made it last night for dinner with my neighbors it was a hit this pie is simple to throw together i used smuckers special recipe butterscotchcaramel
this is one of the easiest and best tasting cheesecake pies i have ever made or had i made it for first time for a family dinner and two whole pies got eaten
no cose i love to eat itand i can39t eat
the recipe is correct as written during baking the caramel sinks to the bottom and the pecans rise to the toptaste of home test kitchen
i39m confused it looks like there are three layers to this pie but the recipe says cheesecake is poured into the pie crust 1st then the pecans and caramel
this is a great recipe and easy
made two of these for a gettogether and everyone loved them
very good
my favorite pie to make and everyone love it
easy to make cheesecake that everyone loves
this pie was to die for
every time i39ve made this recipe for family dinners there is never a piece left i39ve started making two so my husband and i will have someis even better days after being made and it is sooooo easy to make
made this twice already my boyfriend and i love it had slight issue with caramel topping and having to cook it a bit longer but it was terrific
did it 34by the book34 it was perfect
this is one i will have to try
i have made this pie for every family gathering church dinners and for special events it is the easiest and best of all desserts it is always the first pie plate emptied at potluck dinners and guests marvel at it39s appearance and taste everyone will think you spend hours preparing it
doesn39t the recipe say to put the yellow filling in first the picture shows the caramel filling having been put in firstkate
i definitely will make this recipe again it is a delicious pie wonderful taste and texture i have prepared and carried the pie to several gatherings was enjoyed by all an there were no leftovers after reading several of the ratings the problem may be the baking temperature used was not as printed as well as the proper chilling time my pies always look like the pictureyou show
i39ve made this several times but have to add much more baking time to get the center cream cheese set also i had to use a deep dish pie crust and still had caramel mixture left overbut everyone loves it so i will keep making adjustments
if i could give this 7 stars i would i love it and my friends love it even more great rave reviews from all that have had itfor the one that said that the texture was like scrambled eggs maybe the eggs weren39t beaten long enough i use an immersion blender on it and it is smooth as silkthis will be a year round go to recipe church luncheons and at work too
has anyone made this pi ahead of time and frozen it i would like to make it for christmas and freeze it
very easy directions and a simple pie but the pie was a little too eggy for me it wasn39t very appealing when i sliced it the pie looked more like scrambled egg than a cheesecake mixture
i made this for a luncheon for my friends for their birthdayeveryone requested the recipe before they left rave reviews they could not beleive how decadent it was in their own words a big hit i reccomend everyone try this follow the recipe exactly especially the low fat carmel sauce amazing
this is a good recipe would absolutely make it again i only see a very thin layer of the caramel must not used enough
turned out greatgreat alternative to traditional holiday pies
this was very bland and didn39t have enought cream cheese would not make it again
i have made this receipe 3 times so far it is so easy to make and taste amazing
after one bite family members were raving 34awesome34 and 34wonderful34 and 34delicious34 the only negative thing i can say is that i only made one pie instead of two to take to thanksgiving dinner next time i39ll know a huge thanks to whoever created this recipe it39s now added to our evergrowing 34musthaves34 for family gatherings super simple simply delicious
i used a premade frozen deep dish pie crust then i followed the recipe exactly it was perfect everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe
i used mrs richardson39s butterscotch caramel topping fullfat and it was fabulous it was a definite favorite over the pumpkin and sweet potato pies i also used lowfat cream cheese which worked very well happy thanksgiving
i made this pie for thanksgiving and it was marvelous very simple and delicious i was afraid it would be too sweet but it had a perfect balance of flavor i followed the recipe exactly baked it the night before and refrigerated it overnight it came out just like the picture i am a high school teacher and every year our guidance department has an evening event to help encourage students to pursue postsecondary educational opportunities we all bake pies for the students and parents to enjoy i always have difficult time deciding what to make but this year it will be easy this pie is great and i am sure it will be a hit
i have only been able to find the regular caramel topping not the fatfree does anyone know if it will still work or should i keep looking
this is an excellent pie i made two one for my family and one to share and everyone loved it i plan to make one for thanksgiving too
pretty darn goodmaking more now as i type very good and extremely easy to make if it39s not easy and good i don39t make it twice
made this for my birthday very good would make again i made my own crust of butter and flour excellent
i loved the ease in which this dessert came together i made one for my neighbor and one to share with my teaching colleagues they loved it i expect it to be on a few of their thanksgiving menus i also made the doublepastry pie crust recipe from the website for this recipe
i made exactly as recipe written no substititions smuckers in a jar not a bottle the dark layer is the caramel it separates from egg mix and goes to bottom it was deeeliciousand a deep dish is advized
tried it it was delicious will make again
excellent super easy and delicious my husband loved this recipe i will definitely make this again
i would love to make this recipe and i have some questions before i do since i39m diabetic and am appointed to make diabetic desserts for family gatherings has anyone tried using splenda for the sugar and does smucker39s come out with a fatfree sugarfree caramel sauce i39ve seencaramel sauce in squeezable bottles but don39t know if smucker39s makes one in a jar
i made this pie for our family reunion last week it went like crazy my sons girlfriend asked me to make one just for her the minute we got home i have had so many requests for this recipe since then this pie will definitely be on the thanksgiving menu
mine didn39t turn out like the picture i used smuckers low fat caramel sundae topping the only thing that i can think of is that the topping i used came in a squeeze bottle and not in a glass jar either way tasted amazing only thing i didn39t like is that i couldn39t eat a whole slice it was too sweet for me but on the other hand i rarely eat sweets so maybe it is just because i39m not used to all that sugar either way next time i will make it with caramel in a jar instead of the squeeze bottle
this recipe is a keeper everyone that tried it said i could make this for every gettogether we have i have used the lower fat cream cheese and it was just as good
it is super easy and so good at first i was nervous too because of the layers but after refrigeration it is perfect
this recipe was good thought i would try this because of the caramel but it remind me of a pie i make which is a cream cheese pecan pie the recipe was easy to follow i would make it again
would give this 10 stars if i could have made this 2 times and both were gone asap i to was wondering about the layers but decided to go with it sure glad i did just followed directions looked just like the photo it39s definitely a keeper well worth all the calories
very yummy i made this recipe from the cookbook and didn39t see these reviews online until after making it so i used the squeezable container of smuckers sundae topping cookbook recipe doesn39t specify the topping in a jar turned out with a gooey caramel layer under the pecans on top of the cheesecake instead of at the bottom like the picture shows and like they say will happen if you use the correct product it was still yummy i39m only giving it four stars though because i wasn39t blown away and because of the confusion
this is by far the best and easiest pie to make my whole family loves ittry freezing it for an hour and it is better as a frozen desert
this is excellent for the past two xmas it is requested
my husband loves pecan pie cheese cake and caramel so this receipe had everything in it i followed the directions and it came out perfect just like the picture with 3 layersi made it for our 48th anniversary he couldn34t wait the 4 hours for cooling and ate it after 3 it was still perfect i will make it again i think it was better than 5 starssandy
i have made this pie two times now and both times it is a huge success there are no leftovers and everyone raves about the taste for such a quick and simple recipe there is an awful lot of praise this recipe is a definite keeper
this is soooo easy i make one apiece for all my brothers for the holidays they love it
my son has to live on a gluten free diet so i leave the crust offso he can eat it
we39ve received some inquires about the darker layer above the crust and if an ingredient was missing from the recipe the recipe is correct as published the darker layer is the caramel if the correct caramel product is used it will sink to the bottom during bakingtaste of home test kitchen
i liked this pie but i could not figure out what is between the crust and cream cheese it is not in the recipe i rate it a 5 star
it was delicious
it worked fine for me i used half very thick caramel topping and half caramel sundae syrup because that39s what i had and it worked fine i baked mine for 35 minutes then turned off the oven for about 10 more minutes my oven runs hot compared to these recipes but sometimes things aren39t done in the middle so this is my compromise i wasn39t sure what you meant by topping either sounds like a cheaper brand of topping and not syrup will have the caramel sink to the bottom i kind of have an issue with toh in general in that this takes way more than 30 minutes to make in general your recipes all the ingredients are prepared pecans chopped cream cheese softened and then you start the timer i wish you would put your times in as if starting from scratch like recipes that call for chicken to be cooked that takes 25 minutes to do i add the time before printing for my recipe cards
since many comments have been posted about this pie the test kitchen determined we needed to retest it again for clarification it worked just fine for us however two things are important 1 use a regular 9in pie plate not a foil pan as they are smaller 2 use the smuckers fatfree caramel topping other smuckers products or other brands may not produce the same resultstaste of home test kitchen
do you still have this recipe it cannot be found on the website any more thanksjen
i read all the reviews and wondered the same thing about the picture vs directions didn39t make sense i made this for father39s day and it looked like the picture and it was sooo good i don39t know what others did wrong i baked it longer than noted and i used reduced fat cream cheese
pie was a total diaster the carmel ran all over the pie in the oven etc yes you need a deep dish pie crust question regarding the nuts is it only 14 cups or 1 and a quarter
but how do you get the pie to look like the picture the 39caramel39 does not sink to the bottom should part of it be poured into the crust first taste great but sure didn39t turn out like the picture it needs an extra deep pan also bev in sw ohio
yes use the thinner brand of topping for this cheesecake after publishing the recipe we have found that the viscosity of the topping will make a big differencestaz
i made two of these this past weekend and everyone loved them i used smucker39s caramel topping in the 12oz jar not the sundae syrup in the pourable bottle the 12oz jar is approximately one cup of caramel
does this recipe need a deep dish pie crust i had enough filling left over to make another pie i used smuckers caramel flavored sundae syrup which is used for ice cream it was very thin is this the wrong kind of topping what kind should i use i think my pie is going to come out soupy also like the other reviewer39s did thank for your help dragonlady
re caramelpecan cheesecake piethis recipe was easy to make the combination of flavors was wonderful thanks for the recipewendy
i39ve tried this recipe twice and the caramel topping doesn39t not harden and my pie comes out soupy could someone please help if you know what i am doing wrong please email me and let me know i would greatly appreciate it averypaulayahoocom
wow this is an awesome pie i made it for a church pie contest and won first everyone thought it was amazing and would never believe that it was so quick and easy thanks for an awesome recipe this is definitely a keeper
picture shows a brown layer between crust and cream cheese not in recipe make pie cooked for 40 mins cooled refrigerated over night still mushy in center baked for an additional 30 mins cooled refrigerated overnight better but not right
i39m guessing the caramel sinks creating the 3layer look
thanks for this recipe it does look quick and easy but are my eyes playing tricks or are there three layers to the cake in the picture lol miss patty
pi have made this pie a few times and my family loves it even my grandma who never likes anything i make i love pecan pie but think that it is just too rich this is the perfect compromise though i probably consume more calories this way but it is well worth itppthanks for sharing itppcrystalp
you lost me at the flour tortillas those are burritos not enchiladas enchiladas are only made with corn tortillas what you have there is a bunch of goop but it does look tastey
although i love both garlic and mexican food i thought this was terrible the tortillas were soggy and the sauce was awful
i39m not a great cook and this was easy fun and delicious i could have drank the sauce with a straw i took it to work and let people sample it and ended up giving the recipe out multiple times
i have been making this recipe since i first made it in 1999 i love the sage in it i feel it sets it apart if you are worried about the salt use a salt free broth walmart sells one i alternate corn and flour tortillas every other one i feel if they are all corn they are too mushy and all flour to gummy every other is just right this is hands down a recipe that people ask me for over and over again
i guess flour tortillas are okay but mexican enchiladas are made with corn tortillas and they are also healthier
we loved this recipe we love enchiladas and this is one of my favorite recipes so far the sauce was smooth and creamy but i did add a little more of the seasonings i also added a chopped chipotle pepper to the sauce and a tablespoon of adobo sauce to the meat mixture because we like spicy foods overall an excellent recipe i39ll definitely be making it again
made for our family of 4 two kids and two adults we are garlic lovers so this recipe stood out to me everyone ate it although nobody was rushing to get a second helping i thought the sauce was tasty and the dish overall was a solid recipe that said for the time it took to put together i didnt think it was really worth it i made on a weeknight and dinner was served later than usual for the time it took to compose i likely wouldnt make again
very tasty but too much salt i reduced the amount but next time will add no additional salt i really liked the flavor of the sauce and look forward to having again i topped with black olives and chopped jalapenos
very good hubby liked it a lot i agree that adding rice or beans to the meat would be a good option i used half the amount of salt and the minimum amount of chili powder as per other39s ratings depends on how hot you want it some said it was mushy so i didn39t cook it as long
the dish was pretty good i added some leftover rice i found in the fridge as a filler and it was nice next time i39d add corn and black beans to the filling a few notes i wasn39t too crazy about the sauce found it to be quite bland and needing to triple the seasoning it was also way too thick and clumpy i ended up adding water to thin it out i also added a bit of brown sugar to cut the salt and acidity next time i would half the amount of salt on its own it was way too salty thankfully the toppings masked the saltiness this also makes a huge batch of sauce i have enough to last me 3 more occasions
i don39t give 5 stars very often but my husband and i really did like this a lot my teenage boys thought it was fine but they don39t like mexican food that much i used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has way too much salt i also didn39t add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested the salt flavor was perfect my husband also bought the huge tortillas so i still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla i used 7 tortillas but they i cut about 13 off of them i put in a little over 12 cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top we loved the jalapeños and red onion on the top i wish i put avocado on top too the flavor was great there was a ton of sauce and we love sauce great meal
these were delicious the sauce was creamy and smooth they are a bit time consuming i definitely wouldn39t make them on a work day we had friends coming over and they were perfect for entertaining i had the enchiladas put together and when our guests arrived i just popped them in the oven they got rave reviews from everyone i served them with chips and salsa and a southwest salad yum
i was eager to try this from the great reviews but did not care for this at all the major seasonings are chili powder and cumin which give the enchilada sauce on the top an odd flavor and sauce is very thick this ended up being just a pile of mush when you take it out of the oven and not enchilada flavor at all
my mom has been making these for years they39re a little spicy for me because my heat tolerance is slim to none but i still love them i cut the spice with a bit of sour cream on top they39re very filling so we usually only eat a half of one enchilada and then serve with some rice or chips and salsa they feed a crowd that way
it39s so good but even better with home canned broth less salt and homegrown tomatoes stewed and canned
a little salty for me but hubby really liked it
intend to make this soon as my family and i enjoy mexican food immensely thanks to the sodium police for pointing out the overthetop sodium content of 2 enchiladas i will modify the ingredients to reduce sodium when i make them
this recipe looks delicious however enchiladas are not made with flour tortillas they are made with corn tortillas here in colorado to me flour tortillas just turn to mush if baked in a sauce but the recipe looks very good will try it with corn tortillas fried or heated in oil first
a family favorite
been making these ever since the recipe was published and my friends and family love it i triple the recipe and use ground round or ground chuck instead of hamburger i freeze 1 12 2 cups of sauce in a freezer bag and 2 12 cups meat in another freezer bag tripling the recipe makes enough for 4 5 meals i use this recipe when a friend or family member is sick and needs a meal everyone asks for the recipe the only change a made is an omission i add salt because already salt in the broth and tomatoes i also lean towards the lesser amount of chili powder because i have two daughters who like spicy food i love this recipe because it have any beans making it very kidfriendly
i39ve been making this since it very first appeared in taste of home back in 1999 i39ve memorized the recipe all my children 9 have grown up on this and it has become a main staple in our home over the years i love it because it comes from scratch and doesn39t use a canned enchilada sauce everything is absolutely the freshest it can be whoever made up the recipe thank you so much
these were really goodi have much experience with cooking mexican food but i work with several hispanic ladies and they said i would probably like using white corn tortillasivwill definitely be making these againas for the sodium police we can all read the nutritional values for ourselves and decide to cookor not cook so myob
i have been making these for years we live out of the usa and storebought sauce is not available i was glad for the sauce recipe the people in the country i live love garlic to them the more garlic the better the taste in any main dish i reduce the amount of flour to the consistency that i like as for the taco mix and taco itself i make my own soft tacos from a recipe as that is the best we can do here my soft taco is rolled very thin and panfried before i fill them thank you for the recipe it has been a family favorite for years
although i am sure that some people would like thisit is not traditional in any sense of the word it is fusion cooking this is texmex cuisine which obviously has been tweaked from traditional mexican food made to please those north of the border here in texas people put beef in just about everything we always use cheese in our rellenos and enchiladastraditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas as the author notedthe sauce recipe here is very much the same as canned sauce in that both use tomato products i can tell you with authority that most restaurants and mexican homes such as ours never use tomato products in our enchilada sauce california northern and central mexico don39t use tomatoes in this way traditionallyas we live in texas i encounter all sorts of deviations from traditional mexican food some are ok but hubby will not eat enchiladas anywhere but at home due to the fact he is always disappointed in their preparation the same is true with many mexican families herefor my enchilada sauce i only use diced onion cooked in oil until transparent then i add the flour and spices to create a roux and cook for at least 4 minutes i then add the broth better than bouillon chicken and simmer for 30 minutes i don39t add salt as there is enough in the broth my spice mixture is secret and handed down so i will not offer it here
that alright if you like gummy enchiladasi39ve been making enchiladas and never use flour mexicans never use flour eather
way too much sodium you should take in less than 2300 mg a daynot in one meal
pretty good recipe the only thing is there was too much flour too thick needs more sauce and the tortillas were a little soggy i would subtract some flour add more tomato sauce and cook the tortillas a little before preparing them
i prefer homemade enchilada sauce to storebought so i knew i wanted to try this i felt the sauce was lacking a teensy bit and the amount of flour used seems strange but it all came together nicely i think i might try to add more of the chili powder to the sauce next time though i had enough filling to make 23 more enchiladas too
i was very excited to try this recipe based on all the great reviews i liked the simplicity of the recipe and the beef filling for the enchiladas was pretty tasty however i was not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce i have made other fromscratch enchilada sauces i39ve liked better i think this one called for too much flour for my taste it got pretty thick almost the texture of canned tomato soup before you add water to it the overall taste was good though we even ate leftovers the next day but this is most likely not a recipe i39ll save to make again
sounds good to prevent soggy flour todtillas cook them on both sides before rolling
delicious i didn39t know homemade enchiladas sauce was so easy to make i39ll never use the canned one again if i can help it i used 13 cup of flour instead of 12 cup for the sauce
these taste great but my husband said that he would prefer the corn tortilla over the flour as he found them too soggy
great recipe i used 1 12 lbs of ground beef and added in 1 can of rotel diced tomatoes with chilies and 12 package of taco seasoning to give it a little more kick i was short on time so instead of making the homemade sauce i used 1 large can of red enchilada sauce
this was a fantastic recipe i used ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe i love that it doesn39t use canned enchilada sauce
i fixed these for a mexican themed meal and they received rave reviews they39re my son39s favorite enchiladas
my husband and i thought these enchiladas were amazing this was my first time making the sauce from scratch it was easy and great tasting we are garlic lovers and the garlic shines in this dish not over powering but it has the spotlight next to the sauce only thing i changed is the meat my husband does not like ground beef so i used ground lamb it39s much more tender and with the spices you cant taste the lamb witch is good for me
i made these enchiladas for my husband and sons and they really enjoyed them i added 12 cup chopped jalapenos from my garden to the beef mixture since my husband loves hot peppers this recipe was a big hit
this is my first enchiladas that i made and i39m glad its came out great even i misread the last two directions i didn39t put cheese in the tortilla and i put all the cheese on the tortillas before the first bake my husband was raving it and he even brought the leftovers for work i lessened the amount of flour as what the other reviewers said i also lessened the amount of chili because my husband is not fan of spicy and for my 2 year old son this is a keeper and next time i39ll read the directions very carefully
i made this for 3 adults and 7 children under age 9 i made it because i love garlic and then started to worry as i tasted the sauce that the 34kick34 would be too much for all the young kids i was so wrong the kids couldn39t get enough of it i made 1 and 12 batches and it made 14 very full enchiladas there were 2 left for today39s lunch and it tasted even better as leftovers for the sauce i lessened the flour slightly by 2t for 1 12 batches and it was still a little too thick for me other than that i followed the recipe exactly everyone was begging for this meal again soon as they were eating it last night
this is a great recipe as is and easy to modify to suit your needs i make this glutenfree with corn starch instead of flour i use a can of rotel in the meat instead of stewed tomatoes and white corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas i have made this again and again my whole family loves it
i add 1 diced chipotle chile tbsp chipotle sauce while cooking beef for flavor delicious
my family liked this dish i might add less flour to the sauce next time seemed very mild to me in flavor but the dish went together well and froze well a keeper
this has been my goto enchilada recipe ever since i found it in toh many years ago my whole family loves them
very very good it was my first attempt and i had to substitute a few ingredients based on what was available and it still turned out amazing i upped the ingredients i really like onion cheese had to make due when i couldn39t figure out where the hell my chili powder went and why i have so much chinese 5 spice powder no i didn39t add chinese 5 spice powder to the enchiladas
this is a great recipe for enchiladas the flour tortillas are good but we still use corn ones the sauce is great and garlicy you can lower the sage according to your taste we like more cumin and less sage but the recipe is delicious any way you make it you can add cilantro and onion to the beef before you wrap em so so good
i39ve been making this for 15 years ever since i found it in my 1999 taste of home cookbook over the years i39ve tweaked a bit for example we love garlic so i use fresh garlic in the sauce as well as the meat mixture i use rotel milder tomatoes instead of plain stewed tomatoes sometimes i add rice to the meati39ve even added sweet corn amp black beans a few times i left out the sage for years just because i never cooked with it but i started to add it about 5 years ago amp it does make a difference all around a great recipe that39s easy to modify for your own personal tastes
we really enjoy these we39ve made with chicken as well as beef we have also made a pan and frozen them to bake when we needed however we will also bake and then freeze in individual containers vac pack for individual frozen meals when we39re in a hurry
good meal different than traditional enchiladas the garlic taste makes it more unique
i agree with some of the other reviewers the extra 12 tsp of salt is not needed its already salty from the beef broth also i would use corn tortillas like the texture better not so soft like the flour and i would omit the garlic to me thats not really authentic mexican think i39ll add jalapeno instead also sauce did taste a bit floury was good but think i39ll keep looking for a more authentic mexican recipe and was not bland at all i dont know where some of these ppl39s taste buds are
very easy and yummy
doubled this and it turned out great didnt add the salt as the canned tomato has enough in it for us
yummy
it was just ok
as good as everyone says i put the minimum amount of seasoning it called for and it had tons of flavor i will definitely make it again
great
this is my go to recipe for beef enchiladas great everytime
delicious i also forgot the salt and i am a salt addict as well as the flour and it came out wonderful i too will not be buying the store brands of the enchilada sauce any more
this was a nice change from my other enchiladas and enchilada casserole recipes the sauce was a little thick and i could still taste the flour which may be my fault may have needed to let it cook a little longer the were even better the next day for leftover lunches and cold i will make them again but they will never replace my other enchiladas
wonderful company dish
absolutely excellent everyone even my picky eater loved it my only complaint is that it was way too salty and i did not even add all the salt called for and i also used low sodium beef broth so my suggestion is to completely omit the salt i also think this would be great with shredded chicken or beef and with other things added to the filling like rice beans or pickled jalapenos i had enough filling for 13 of the 6 inch tacos i bet you could also use corn tortillas instead of flour if you wish over all this was amazing and i will definitely make it again i bet this would freeze well if you freeze it before cooking
very tasty however and before any of you point it out yes i saw the name of the recipe lol i will say i will put in less garlic next time so that the other flavors can shine as well loved it and loved not using a canned sauce deff in our dinner rotations
fantastic sauce i will never by store brand again my family preferrs pulled beef or chicken as a swop for the ground beef added a few additional spices and a jalepeno to the mix even as is this is a keeper
absolutely love it my family loved it it was a hit i followed everything step by stepdelicious thank you for this recipe definitely a keeper
excellent very easy to make and really like the enchilada sauce our family does not care for the commercial brands of sauce that we have tried but this is good
this is a delicious dish i do however agree that it is time consuming and makes a lot of dirty dishes working 12 hours a day i think this will have to be a day off preparation i followed the recipe as follows using the spices that officer 12 tablespoons full 15 and it wasn39t too salty or bland very good
this is one recipe that i will not make any changes to i plan on making it today my husband loved it
this were delicious the enchilada sauce was super easy to make and cheaper to make than it is to buy the sauce at the store i will be making the sauce for my own enchiladas but using jalapenos for the heat instead of garlic my family loves it spicy
i made this for my family they did enjoy it i however altered the recipe by adding garlic salt and garlic powder to taste the sauce seemed to taste just like tomatoes to me so it needed tweaking i also don39t buy beef broth i made my own with beef base and water maybe that was the difference anyway already had one request for this again we love mexican inspired dishes
delicious and easy to make i used ground sirloin for less fat mexican stewed tomatoes and also used lowfat mexican blend cheese plenty of sauce too loved it
lots of sauce we loved it
i loved all the garlic in the sauce my family said that this was their favorite enchilada recipe surprising because i rarely use ground beef in my mexican food recipes listed sodium content is so high i believe to be a typo i still would use reduced sodium canned ingredients and not add the additional salt
we only made one small change to the recipe we omitted the sage amp added cayenne it was amazing this is our new go to enchilada recipe
this was very good but does take a bit of time and dishes to prepare i used only 2 tbsp of butter and less flour and broth i added 13 cup queso fresco cheese and we like that a lot i am thrilled to know how to make this great red sauce
this was very good but does take a bit of time and dishes to prepare i added 13 cup queso fresco cheese and we like that a lot i am thrilled to know how to make a great red sauce
these were better than i expected i had to make some changes because i didn39t have everything once i started i followed the recipe except i subbed chili powder for chili seasoning from the packets i used fresh tomatoes and a little bit of pace salsa to equal the stewed tomatoes i skipped the sage and used the upper portions of each seasoning and added a llittle cayenne pepper oh and i also had to used cheddar cheese i heated the tortillas beforeassembling too it was so good
excellent i followed the recipe as given but used the smaller amounts of seasonings when given a choice will definitely make this again
these were delicious
i think the tortillas i used were a tad bigger than recommended they barely fit into my dish but they sure were good and tasty
made this recipe as is but we didn39t care for it which was disappointing after all of the positive reviews will not make again
fun and easy recipe great flavor
haven39t made the enchiladas yet have it in my cook39n file amp can39t wait to try it next week but used the sauce in the chimichangas i made last night it added a great taste to them the reviews about how good the sauce is are accurate i typed the sauce recipe up separately amp will be using it for mexican cuisine
enchiladas made with flour tortillas sacrilege
these sound terrific but we do not like sage what spice could i use in place of it
these are absolutely delectable i warmed the flour tortillas on a comal prior to filling them seemed to keep the tortillas from getting pasty very good
these are absolutely delectable i warmed the flour tortillas on a comal prior to filling them seemed to keep the tortillas from getting pasty very good
loved by 4 boys and a dad
i usually like to make green sauce enchiladas after making this i dont know if ill ever beable to go back these are by far the best beef enchiladas i have ever had i love garlic so add more than the recipe calls for kudos
incredible such a homemade taste the spices were perfect nice creamy tasty sauce and the amounts were great for our taste enough sauce but not swimming in it i did spread the sauce all over the top of the rolled tortillas once they were in the pan as another reviewer said and it really kept them from being too dry and crunchy i made the whole recipe then split it into two 9inch glass dishes two whole dinners for my husband and me
love these i actually made 50 more last time to have some extra sauce and meat and that39s tonight39s nachos thanks for the recipe
omgthese are amazing most enchilada recipes i have call for storebought enchilada sauce or a mix of other stuff that isn39t very enchiladay tasting this sauce was fab the beef is fab love love love my family loved it this is 39companygood39 for a casual meal
my kids really liked these
pthis recipe rocks my family and friends love it it is my go to recipe for something different in the weekly meal planning been making it for years can39t go wron making this one the only thing i change is i delete the salt and you can39t even tell it39s missing great job and thankyou very muchp
i39ve been looking for this recipe for 11 years it was a staple in my home and i lost my recipe folder in a move thank you thank you
the enchiladas were good but i was expecting to be wowwed after reading all the reviews and i wasn39t maybe it really makes a difference as to how much of the spices was used i put in the minimum amount when it said 341 to 2 tsp or tablespoons34 maybe i should have put in the full amount i have other enchiladas recipes i like better but i might make this again we39ll see how the leftovers taste tomorrow
very good makes a lot which i like my husband and i love mexican flavors and this tasted just as good as going out for enchiladas soo yummy
my entire family loves this recipe variations1 use cooked turkey or chicken instead of beef great way to use up leftover thanksgiving turkey2 add a small layer of cannned refried beans to the tortilla before rolling up
absolutely delicious such good flavor and the sauce was the greatest nothing like that can enchilada sauce the only thing i will do different next time is double the sauce and add an additional 8oz can of tomato sauce very very good really the person who said these were bland have no taste buds i substituted the stewed tomatoes for a can of rotel like another reviewer did excellent
i never comment on recipes but this was amazing i only used 3 cloves of minced garlic in the sauce and next time i will use 2 this is just an awesome dish there is no way that person who wrote it is bland followed the directions it is anything but bland wow i love mexican food and this is so easy
the best enchilada i39ve ever eaten in my life the meat mixture is soooo delicious i use it to make nachos as well by far a must have on any monthly menu plan d
these are awesome the beef filling is my favorite but the sauce is very yummy too i happen to have fresh garlic from our farmer39s market and this recipe really lets it shine my daughter can39t wait for them to come out of the oven after sampling the filling
i added rotel to the meat to add a little heat yummy
loved it very yummy and easy to change to different tastes so glad to now have a recipe that doesn39t need canned enchilada sauce we will be making this often serves a crowd for very little cost
we did not care for this recipe at all we found it to bland
good to cook
good recipe to cook
absolutely delicious if you like use shredded cooked chicken in the filling add after the onions are cooked in a little olive oil instead of the beef substitute chicken broth for the beef broth
delicious i didn39t add any salt and used low sodium broth and they turned out great for the sauce i used the 1 tsp of chilli powder cumin and sage and still had enough kick for us will make again
it doesn39t look anything like the picture but it39s excellent
we have been making this recipe for years and we love it we prefer corn tortillas and double the sauce
i have made this recipe exclusively for years another thing i love about this recipe is that they freeze really well for those days when you don39t have time to cook
the homemade sauce is heavenly
just a tip for those feeling it tastes too salty add only a little salt in the beginning you can always add more as you cook and taste can39t wait to try this thanks for the reviews
this is really tasty my whole family enjoyed even my kids i used corn tortillas for myself to make it glutenfree i found i had to dipbrush sauce on both sides to keep them from breaking i left out the flour in the filling and used 14 cup cornstarch in place of the flour in the sauce to make it gf i just added the cornstarch to the broth i think this would taste good with beans either in the filling or on the side next time i might try reducing the butter has anyone tried that
the only change we will be making next time is to make more sauce delicious recipe though
loved this recipe great flavors and different from my regular enchiladas it was a nice change making them again tonight for cinco de mayo
very very very good lots of flavor enough spice to give it a kick but not overwhelming will definately make it again i did change one thing used 15lbs beef cause 1lb didn39t seem enough
having grown up on mexican food we never used corn tortillas always flour this was too salty and all the spices left us drinking a lot of water dredging the tortillas in the sauce before filling and rolling would make them look more authentic
this recipe is great easy to make tastes as good as any mexican restaurant my son requests this at least once a week
if my family had their way i would make this more often i make extra sauce with it i have to double the recipe written down for many family membes too
this was totally gross all i could taste was salt and i love salt will go back to my original receipe wanted to try something new and wish i hadn39t
i love this recipe the sauce is so good who would ever buy sauce i can39t decide if i like it better with flour tortillas or corn great standby recipe
these were great definitely my new go to beef enchilada recipe
this is one of my favorite recipes thank you for sharing
jennifer this recipe is outstanding hubby raves about it everytime i make it
i substituted a can of rotel tomatoes for the tomato sauce with great results it gave it a nice extra kick
this is one of the best recipes i39ve ever tried we use chicken for the filling this sauce is the best
excellent recipe for mexican fare
if i am lazy and don39t want to make the meat sauce i squish up my homemade chili that i always keep a supply of in the freezer and use it instead and i agree with mattnat i could practically drink the sauce
this is well worth the time it takes in the kitchen every time i make it the sauce is so delicious i end up scraping the pan and licking the spoon the other night i made the meat filling from this recipe put it in some store bought tostada bowls with some salad fixings it was a big hit my kids are not fans of enchiladas so i save some tortillas when i make the enchiladas and make 34soft tacos34 for them
this dish is so delicious i also use the meat recipe for tacos this is a recipe that i will use over and over again thanks
i got this recipe from my husbands grandmother and have made it for years but i add raisins nuts and sweetened coconut flakes
wow this was delicious i accidentally put 3 eggs and i used about 4 cups apples and it still came out perfect i just drizzled the sauce over the whole cake while it was still warm definitely will make again
i must have used too many apples i got dried up apple chunks instead of a cake the recipe looks so good and you all have had success what did i do wrong
love this cake and everyone i make it for does too
hello i made this chunky apple cake last family party it was a huge hit the cake the sauce omg was really really good keep making this for special events thank you so much
i tried this recipe a few years ago and it is now a fall tradition in our home my family asks me to make it every october the cinnamon flavor and chunks of apple make it delicious i serve it with the yummy caramel sauce and homemade whipped cream this sweet dessert gets 5 stars
first of all i have been making this cake for years it is an all time favorite of mine next there are a few speedboats you hit while making for example the batter is very thick honestly it39s more the consistency of cookie dough dont try to use a hand mixer on this it will break been there done that the reason for that though is all the liquid that is in the apples will cook out and mix with the batter while baking it39s supposed to be like that next it is very sweet if you use anything other than a tart apple i always go straight for the big granny smiths anything else just adds together to make a sugary overload last the end result is a very moist very heavy cake best if eaten quickly even better if warm it will not last more than a couple of days pairs beautifully with some vanilla icecream cinnamon and caramel never actually used the butterscotch sauce part of the recipe never felt it was the right kind of flavor makes for a fantastic breakfast or dessert and it39s perfect for those cool autumn nights and brisk winter mornings
loved loved loved it i39m so glad i only used one cup of sugar instead of two as the apples provide a lot of sweetness as well turned out delicious
i always make the recipe my own i buttered the dish and dusted it with a cinnamon sugar mix cinnamon sugar mixture 14 cup granulated sugar 1 tsp cinnamon whatever cinn sugar is leftover i added to the cake batter mix i used 2 c unsweetened applesauce to substitute cut up apples i used 1 tsp pure vanilla extract then i added 12 tsp ground cloves in addition to spices it baked in 38 minutes using a pyrex dish i also made the butterscotch sauce my family liked it it could stand alone without sauce or frosting lt is delicious
made this last night and it was delicious the standout for me was the sauce if i made it again i would definitely cut down on the sugar but otherwise it was perfect
excellent cake since i don39t like nutmeg i added extra cinnamon yum constance please post the 34apple stuffed french toast34 thanks connie
husband liked this cake however i thought it was too heavy and dense after the first day best eaten first day when very fresh
every fall i make this cake usually with a mixture of different apples since i gather an assortment at the local farm it has become a favorite amongst my family and friends with or without the sauce or whipped creme the apple contest winners issue is one of my favorites we also look forward to the apple stuffed french toast
i39ve made this a few times now and it39s always a big hit after reading the reviews i chose to use 1 cup of sugar and 12 cup of brown sugar rather than 2 cups of white sugar it39s sweet enough and had an amazing texture the last time i made it i also tried slicing the apples rather than cutting them into chunks and my husband preferred it this way this is such an easy and delicious recipe thanks
this apple cake is good i added walnuts and raisins as some suggested i make the butterscotch sauce i bought a bottle of caramel sauce for topping if not eating the whole cake right away the homemade sauce seem like a good idea
really great flavor and easy to make i used a food processor for the apples and cut the calories by using egg beaters lf yogurt spread brummel amp brown and monk fruit with a little splenda to sweeten it since i can39t have a lot of sugar served with with a cup of hot latte it39s so comforting especially on a chilly fall afternoon next time i39ll add raisins keeps well in the fridge this is a keeper
i already left my review but wanted to say i did find that i needed the full 12 teaspoon of baking soda for the half recipe so i39m thinking a full teaspoon for the whole cake at any rate really awesome recipe
you forgot the walnuts chopped walnuts make a huge difference
i have made this for years it was called apple dapple cake
when i put this recipe together the batter was extremely thick and i could barely fold in the apples i struggled to press it into the 9x13 pan i thought for sure i would have to throw it out the next day and find another recipe for the birthday party to my amazement it cooked perfectly and my family loved it i will use this recipe without fear for any occasion
i use to make this all the time my exmotherinlaw taught it to me but she always sliced not diced her apples and never used any topping other than an occasional sprinkling of powdered sugar it was one of the few cakes that my stepdad a type 2 diabetic could eat once in a while i39ve made this both ways and it39s awesome either way but i think i lean more towards the no icing and sliced apples
delicious this is my go to apple cake everyone loves itwith the sauce
made this for my husband39s collector club i didn39t have the spices individually so i used apple pie spice it worked well i didn39t have time to make the butterscotch sauce but the cake itself was sweet enough one of my husband39s friends went back for seconds
epic failure don39t know what we did wrong but it wasn39t cake at allmore like apple crisp that wasn39t crisp sickening sweet
love it perfect for the fall
i just made this recipe i was a bit hesitant when i read review but i decided to try it i had to cut it in half because just two of us and it turned out moist and tasty i did reduce my bake time to 35min because i prepared a 9x9 pan the dough is stiff as it mentions i have beaters so i used a wooden spoon for stirring turned out good with a little more effort
scott what on earth did you do i have made this cake at least 30 times since it was first published in 2006 it was delicious every single time the batter is full of apples so the first time i made it i wasn39t sure there would be enough batter to hold it together but there was i am often asked to bring this cake to parties gettogethers school events etc i39m printing out a new copy of the recipe bc mine is so smudged up from using so many times
this was a huge disappointment it does smell good so i am hoping that serving it hot with a scoop of ice cream may make it edible so it doesn39t have to be dumped in the garbage i don39t have extra in food budget to be throwing away food the stiffness of the 34batter34 is a cause for concern i am going to try to save this mess and will never make it again
absolutely delicious i also used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar added 14 tsp more of cinnamon doubled the butterscotch sauce and cooked for 20 minutes or so for thicker consistency i served it warm with the sauce and a scoop of french vanilla ice cream my son and his wife took half the cake home for their family and will be bringing me more apples to make this again
delicious i followed some of the suggestions and used 1 cup of white sugar and i2 cup of brown sugar added 1 cup of raisins and just sprinkled with powdered sugar frosting or sauce is not needed
this is a great cake kinda had a panic moment when i found out there enough cinnamon in the pantry so i put what cinnamon and nutmeg was back on the shelf and grabbed the pumpkin pie spice threw in a scant tblsp problem solved there will be a next time making this cake so be to try the original version
what this cake lacks in a lovely presentation it makes up for in flavor it was moist
good flavor and texture followed recommendation to reduce sugar i did 1 cup white sugar and 12 c brown sugar also nutmeg flavor seems a little strong i would reduce and possibly increase cinnamon if necessary make sure you choose to use tart apples to get the best flavor
the cake was moist and good and the sauce made it even better i used 1 14 cups of sugar and that worked perfectly
i decreased the amount of sugar per previous reviewers recommendations to 1 14 cup sugar i didn39t spend the times and effort making the sauce rather some caramel syrup and whipped cream instead this cake doesn39t really need any toppings as it is delicious by itself
this is awesome cakebut i only use 34 cup of sugarand that is still plenty sweetespecially with the sauce on top most of the time i don39t even use the sauce because the cake is delicious by itself and i only sprinkle confectioners sugar on top just before serving easy and delicious
great cake i did toss the apples in some butter and cinnamon sugar before adding them to the cake mix
while the recipe is simple the cake was very sweet i would reduce the sugar to 1 141 12 cups
i took this cake to a party this past weekend and it disappeared in a heartbeat everyone wanted the recipe it is moist and delicious and easy to make i will definitely be baking this again soon
phenomenal cake
reduced sugar to 1 12 cups and left out cinnamon as i don39t care for it it turned out really well loved the butterscotch sauce which was wonderful with the whipped cream good compliments were received
really good i had a dinner party and the person who was supposed to bring dessert couldn39t make it i didn39t have everything the recipe called for i used ingredients i had on hand to create this yummy cake i only had 1 12 braeburn apples left over from a fruit salad so i used that and a cup of applesauce i used 1 cup of white sugar and 12 cup of brown i also only used a 12 teaspoon of nutmeg and 12 teaspoon of cloves 2 teaspoons vanilla and 13 teaspoons baking power 12 teaspoon of baking soda i baked these into cupcakes at 350 for 25 minutes i didn39t make the topping but just dusted the tops with powdered sugar the batter was kind of like cookie dough these were mouse and delicious everyone really enjoyed these and said i should make again
absolutely the perfect dessert easy to make and delicious to eat a definite keeper
easy the sauce was the best will uses sauce for other receipts
i39ve made this recipe numerous times and always get raving reviews best apple cake recipe by far
i love apple cake and have struggled to find one that i really like and would make again this is it it is also versatile you can add a little less sugar more or less of your spices with or without a topping it is really good with a scoop of ice cream i found it was a decadent dessert with a praline sauce drizzled over it
i found the recipe way too sweet i will definitely repeat it but i39ll do 1 14 cup of sugar instead everything else was great that would be my best advice
this was a great apple cake i had never made one before so when the batter was stiff i was at the concernedbut sure enough it turned out fabulous i didn39t bring any home from my dinner party it was delicious with or without the sauce
this is a fantastic recipe i must have looked at 20 25 recipes before choosing this one i wanted a recipe that used a lot of apples and used butter instead of oil the reviews of most of the recipes said they cut the amount of oil and still made a too moist or oily cake this is a moist cake but not too moist the batter is stiff until you add the apples it easily spread into the pan i wanted to taste more apple so cut the nutmeg in half it was perfect you can still taste the nutmeg but it39s not overpowering i bought caramel sauce instead of making the butterscotch sauce the cake is great even without any sauce my husband said this recipe was definitely a keeper
i have made this recipe numerous times over the years and it is a decadent family favorite making again today
i pocked the cake all over and poured the caramel sauce over the cake right out of the oven so good
this is a really good cake when i spread it into the pan it seemed like more apple than cake didn39t look like it would ever make a cake the juice from the apples mixed with the batter and made a nice moist apple pie cake everyone loved it
best apple cake i have ever made
i followed this recipe exact except i substituted splenda for sugar the recipe said the batter would be stiff and i could have rolled it out like pie crust i added milk to make the batter that i could put in a cake pan and spread out it had plenty of apples and the butterscotch sauce made it taste wonderful did not look good but tasted great will not make this again
this was fresh and delicious easy to make and love the spices a keeper for sure thanks debi
sounds good i39ve never tried making this before i39ve given it a 3but could it be made with pears instead i have some to use up in the fridge someone please let me know asap
the best apple cake ever
so very moist turned out great followed the recipe to a t it stayed very fresh on the counter for 3 days i poured the sauce on each piece right before serving to keep the cake from getting soggy simply delicious
easy and delicious a great way to use some of the abundance of apples we have at this time of year this came out picture perfect i used half and half and the sauce was great really liked it
great for fall
a great apple cake that is nice and juicy the butterscotch sauce adds a delectable flavor to this wonderful fall cake don39t worry if the batter looks quite thick the juice from the apples helps it cook perfectly
best apple cake ever i remember when this won the apple contest
this was excellent i tried stirring the apples in for a few seconds and then just used my hands i will definitely make this again
delicious i used close to 5 cups of chopped apples and it still seemed like a lot i used a caramel whiskey sauce because i already had some made up and a dollop of home made whipping cream and oh was it good i will make the butterscotch sauce the next time and as another person said the cake stands on its own i myself loved the texture of the flaky crunch on top of the cake my husband loves anything baked with apples in it and this one was a big hit
i made this for my family and they loved it
oh my i knew this would be good when i read the ingredients but i had no idea that it would be so fabulous it is so full of apples that make it incredibly moist the sauce was the crowning glory i served it with whipped cream but next time will pair it with vanilla bean ice cream i can39t wait to make it again
using granny smith apples provided the right tartness level to balance out the sweetness of the sauce we thought the recipe was perfect as is i even had a guest sneak another helping right out of the pan in the kitchen
delicious cake i too cut the sugar in half but added 34cup of walnuts with melted butter and brown sugar mixed together as a topping great with or without the sauce i have made this three times in the last month with many compliments thank you debi for the recipe
i made the cake asis and it was perfect i wouldn39t change a thing except that with my oven i needed about 10 minutes more baking time oh and i used 4 different types of apples granny smith jazz pink lady and braeburn as others have stated the batter was indeed quite stiff but my little sunbeam mixer could still handle it when it was time to stir in the apples the fruittobatter ratio was very high no wonder this cake is so incredibly moist speaking of whichdont worry if the surface of your cake is hard and crusty when it comes out of the oven after its mostly cooled cover it with foil and it will resolve itself shortly to become uniformly moist and tender as with most cakes it39s better the second day i think the cake stands on its own without the sauce but that punch of sweetness is a nice treat i added a few drops of butterrum extract just for fun i will make this sauce again for other things ice cream or a dip for apples for example five stars
i didnt put the sauce on because butterscotch flavour is my least favourite but the cake was very yummy without it bewared tho i didnt use apples from the store and i mixed up my eating apples with the ones meant for cider almost didnt turn out
this cake is so good i cut down on the sugar in the cake and sauce my husband absolutely loved it and he preferred it without the sauce i like it with the sauce so its wonderful either way
the texture was soggy the taste was bland the sauce only added more sweet to a really sweet cake and then throw in the fat and butter and there was nothing to find tasty
very good i took the advise of the other comments amp only used 12 tsp nutmeg i also didn39t make the sauce because i didn39t have the cream my family thought it was good just as it was a keeper
definitely a 34keeper34 apple recipe i used newtown pippin applesgreat chunky flavor i too had to bake the cake an extra 5 minutes each time i39ve made it the top doesn39t spring back so i look for a goldenbrown top instead the sauce is nice but not necessary i took the advice of another reviewer and used butterscotch topping instead this cake is fine served at any temperature this cake is a contest winner for sure
this desert was so good made it for thanksgiving and it went over very well will make again and again
ok i cheatedlol i couldn39t help it i used honeycrisp apples cut the nutmeg in half used 14 cup less sugar added a spoon of molasses added 1 cup raisins added 1 cup apple ciderbut anyway it turned out great
wow is all i can say made it for a special family dinner and everyone loved it i used granny smith apples and followed the recipe to a tee my only adjustment was to bake it a little bit longer until done
is vry delicious even without the topping i didn39t have time to make the butterscotch topping but served it with ice cream and hot caramel topping instead it was fabulous i also omitted the nutmeg since i39m not a fan of it still turned out great will keep this recipe on hand for a different fall apple dessert
i just made it for the second time tonight it39s amazing and the butterscotch sauce and fresh whipped cream are an amazing combination
this was very good i didn39t have all six cups of apples i only had 2 granny smith and 2 fugi which gave me close to 5 it didn39t matter because it was still full of apples and really delicious the crust on top was crispy after baking so i wasn39t able to test with the spring back like a regular cake recipe so just use a toothpick to test it almost tastes like an apple crisp cake i have to add the i didn39t make the sauce and it was sweet enough without it my boyfriend doesn39t eat sweets and thinks its too sweet but i can39t stop eating it i gave some to my family and they loved it too i will probably make it again
this is the first time i39ve ever posted a recipe review i had to cook this about 5 mins longer than suggested but the result was quite simply the best cake i have ever tasted my friends family everyone agreed better after 1 day in the pan covered with foil it just got more and more moist as time went on i didn39t make the sauce it39s sweet enough it doesn39t need it though my little boy really liked it with cream poured over the top we live in london they do that here amazing
i have made this often it39s amazing
i used frozen peaches
i don39t think i cooked it long enough the cake tasted delicious but i think it could of cooked a little longer have made it with and without sauce and either way it is a winner
followed recipe as given wasn39t baked long enough raw too much spice overpowered apple taste family said losethe recipe
so yummy and easy to make everyone loved it
love making seasonal cakes for the family they loved it will be a keeper
my family loves this cake i make it at least twice a year
so good my husband almost ate half of it in one sitting loved the sauce i didnt have the cream so i used half and half then put a couple tablespoons of flour in it to thicken it up
i39ve been making this almost every year since is appeared in the toh magazine i remember how 34wowed34 we were at the first bite i haven39t met a person yet who didn39t love this prizewinning chunky apple cake it definitely is a falltime favorite in this house mmmmmm good and the sauce is so delish
this is the second time making it the first time was when it came out as the grand prize winner in 2006 i don39t change a thing and it39s perfect the amount of sauce is perfect with the cake any more would make it too sweet and some have said that the amount of nutmeg was a bit much but i didn39t think so it39s a matter of taste i served it with a side of butter pecan ice cream wonderful
what a great recipe i live in washington state and i am always on the lookout for apple recipes it turned out great the first time i made it thanks for sharing
this is amazing i put a little more apple in it and use empire apples with peel on some i too use a little less nutmeg and double the sauce everyone loves it i also use 1 cup br sugar instead of 2 cups white
this was delicious my one piece of advice would be to make sure you cook it long enough for us the 45 minutes was not long enough it tasted fine raw but better when we cooked it long enough thanks for the recipe
i got this recipe long ago when it first appeared in the magazine i made it many times for my family until the recipe got lost over a year ago i am so happy to find it here again the only thing i do differently is that i only use 12 teaspoon nutmeg so that the nutmeg does not overpower the cake and the butterscotch sauce is delicious
the only thing i would change on this recipe is a little less nutmeg i tasted it too much i also didnt use the sauce on top and it was absolutely delicious without it
real good with vanilla ice cream
it has become my new best birthday cake anyone that tastes it raves it has a texture a little like bread pudding it39s great
excellent recipe very moist and delicious
tried this recipe a the assisted living facility i work forit was awesome the residents loved iti had to double the recipe but left the amount of apple the same as for one i also shredded the applesthe caramel sauce made the desertwill definated make this one again
i made this the other day for my husband and it was fabulous very flavorful and moist didn39t change a think on the recipe i would make it again any day thanks for the recipe
i had never made apple cake before this my family really enjoyed it i made it in a lasagna pan because there were so many apples i used 4 large granny smiths the sauce was thin so i whisked in some powdered sugar to thicken it i served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream it was delicious
this was so dry i39d never make it again
i have made this recipe many many times to rave reviews i made a few changes like adding a streusel topping along with chopped walnut on top the crumbly nutty top tastes very good with the sauce
excellent with no changes to the recipe i will make this again and again
amazing taste and extremely moist a huge hit at work
cake turned out very well moist and good taste i added nuts to the batter there is an awful lot of sugar in this recipe have another recipe for apple cake that i like better would make again because my husband loved it
i cut the nutmeg in half but otherwise followed the directions it was sooooo yummy
i made this cake for a nursing home fall festival it was a great hit made it using sweet and tart apples the batter was real thick but it turned out to be the best cake ever now i have apple trees in my new home and plan on making it every year
the sauce reheats in the microwave very well i39ve toted this cake the sauce in a covered microwaveable container and a can of redi whip into the office on several occasions nuke the sauce stirring a couple of times just before you serve the cake it helps if you use a small gravy ladle to pour the sauce over the cake
i made this cake exactly as written it was excellent great for pot lucks if you can keep the delicious sauce warm and top just as you serve it i tried putting it on top and cutting later but makes it very soggy if it sits too long it is the best and yes the i wondered when i made the batter if it would cook up correctly as it didn39t seem to have enough liquid but as others have state the apples have a lot of moisture and the cake turns out wonderful this is a keeper and we will have at thanksgiving time
this is great i39ve made it three times in 2 weeks it39s a huge hit
made this tonight for the first timeomg soooo good maybe less nutmeg next time
i will make it again and again everyone in the house loves it if you run out or don39t care for butterscotch try a little whipping cream ooooh yum
after reading the reviews about the batter being stiff i was a little concerned the catch is that the moisture from the apples cooking puts the added moisture in it is very moist and full of our favorite fall flavors apples cinnamon and nutmeg
this is a great tasting cake will definitely make again only change will be to use about half the nutmeg thought the original amount a bit over powering
excellent taste
i used spice grinders for an explosion of fall flavor what a moist delicious cake like a candied apple but easier to eat i like the nutmeg myself but did add extra vanilla
this was to die foreveryone loved it
this recipe was great except i cut the nutmeg way down to 18 teaspoon used 1 tsp vanilla and used mcintosh apples gets more like a bread pudding the longer it sits the caramel sauce is fantastic and makes it
this recipe sounds really good was just wondering if you could use canned apples thanksshymee57
i have been making the pumpkin cake which is basically the same but apples and applesauce instead of the pumpkin i can39t wait to try this one the pumpkin cake was such a hit with my family it is now the new birthday cake
this looks delicioius can39t wait to try it i have a lot of family that visit and this will be a new dessert for me to try on them thanksmbradway
such a good cake i39ll be making it for my farmer39s market booth this week it39ll be a hit
this apple cake looks very good however 365 calories for one piece and 2 cups of sugar not good for my diet
i39ve made a recipe similiar for years only difference is 12 c veg oil instead of butter and 4 cchopped apples and 1 c chopped walnuts i didn39t have sauce but will try it you all should too as it turns out great apples have alot of liquid don39t forget this was my dad39s favorite fall recipe
well how did it turn out with very little liquid called for in the recipe
i have the same question isn39t there a liquid needed in this recipe i haven39t made it but don39t want to mix all of these nice ingredents up and have something not so good please let us knowsue g
elliston i haven39t made this yet on the schedule for this afternoon but frequently apple cakes have a very thick batter because of the moisture the apples release when cooking update this is great moist lots of apple flavor love the fact that it has so many apples and the butterscotch sauce is perfect with it
i tried to make this cake but the batter was like cookie mix was an ingredient left out like milk or some other kind of liquid i have a similar recipe that calls for milk any suggestions
this was so delicious i used heavy cream because my hubby didn39t realize it wasn39t whipping cream but it didn39t make any difference i definitely won39t wait until the next holiday season to make this one yum
very gooood cakeone i will make againloved the sauce lisa
wvallj i think that applesauce would be an ideal replacement but i have also used 34i can39t believe it39s not butter34 fat free and have had excellent results the splenda sugar blends brown and white will also help nix some of the calories
this is one of the best recipes i39ve kept from taste of homeit really is a crowd pleaserkinwv
i would like to know if anyone has substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter i would think that would make the cake a little more moist and less fattening anyone
i have made this cake several times and it is more than a crowd pleaser every time it is simply delicious and very easy to make i made it for the first time for dinner with my motherinlaw and since then she always tells people what a great cook i am
i made this cake and brought it into the office along with the sauce which reheats in the microwave beautifully and a can of whipped topping the cake was inhaled by my coworkers in what seemed like a matter of minutes i39ve made it using a combination of tart and sweet apples when that was all i had on hand and it turned out just as well what an awesome recipe
pelliston i haven39t made this yet on the schedule for this afternoon but frequently apple cakes have a very thick batter because of the moisture the apples release when cooking update this is great moist lots of apple flavor love the fact that it has so many apples and the butterscotch sauce is perfect with itp
i made this it was pretty good i only used 14 cup of sugar and it was still way too sweet omit the sugar next time consider this a dessert rather than a side dish but good note if you make this with cheese it will be slightly less firmer than without so you may want to lessen a liquid ingredient maybe the milk
the best ever a family favorite added at my house
i39ve tried a wide variety of corn pudding recipes and this is the best i39ve found made it at thanksgiving and everyone loved it this will now be my goto recipe
made since discovering a recipe as a young newlywed from a church fundraising cookbook eons ago and it has been a great standby for many years as my kids grew i eventually quit making it some years back and now my youngest daughter who is now out in her own tries to make it the problem is that the industry has changed the cornbread mix formula and they just the same as the ones from back when when this recipe was really popular which is what prompted me to just stop making it corn pudding is a tried and true mixes that can mess it up
got rave reviews at my christmas dinner delicious
this moist corn pudding recipe was quick to prepare and everyone loved it i doubled the recipe for thanksgiving and will definitely be making this again
this is delicious it took me 58 minutes in an oval casserole dish to look set in the middle i opened my cans to find that they were both creamed corn so i found a 12 oz bag of frozen corn that i microwaved for a few minutes to defrost and it worked perfectly i plan to make this recipe all the time
this recipe tastes very similar to the recipe that has been served at our past family thanksgivings i39m so happy to find a corn pudding recipe that39s moist and sweet
i made this recipe on 1062020 what a scrumptious recipe a real keeper too i did use a smaller can of creamed corn 875oz and the standard size of golden kernel corn well drained and used a 2qt square casserole dish i found that i needed to bake the pudding at least 1 hour due to the lower oven temperature this pudding was really moist and fluffy thank you for sharing this recipe with taste of home
this is fabulous i have made other recipes that my husband thought were sort of ok he loves this fluffy moist delicious
my friends and family told me last night that this is cornbread crack lol everyone loved it so much super easy to make too
this is so quick and easy to prepare and tastes amazing my family loved it will make it again for sure it is creamy goodness with crispy browned edgesyum
have made this many timesthe family requests it for all our get togetherswe prefer it with green chilies and cheddar cheese addedyummy
i made this today to bring for a family potluck and it was a hit i am definitely making it at home again
i get rave reviews for this dish every time and many request the recipe i39m in my kitchen now making another batch to bring to thanksgiving dinner have a happy one everybody
i use a similar recipe with no sugar or milk and only 1 egg the center is not supposed to set this recipe is for corn casserole not corn bread think of it as a bread pudding texture very moist is what makes it so good
absolute breeze wonderfully tasty don39t be afraid of the brown i thought i accidentally left it in too long but the middle was just nicely set and the edges were a lovely dark crispy brown with a nice bit of browning across the entire top
fabulous recipe i used greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and reduced the sugar to 14 cup i took the test kitchens suggestion and added 12 cup of cheddar cheese and a 14 cup of chopped green chilies we really enjoyed this recipe vfe
i used this recipe and me and my mom loved it i used 14 sugar instead of 12 cup and i did 12 cup of sour cream instead of 1 cup came out perfectly
a very similar recipe was given to me by my mother many years ago my version has no eggs or milk and only one tablespoon of sugar i bake it in a deep 2 qt casserole always take it to my office christmas potluck and get rave reviews and no leftovers i like the suggestion of adding green chilies and will definitely try that
far too sweet for our tastes even with the sugar cut in half next time i will eliminate the sugar altogether and add some salt pepper and maybe onion powder however it rose beautifully and was light and fluffy
followed recipe exactly and casserole did not rise daughter made it a few weeks ago and had same results perhaps a 9x13 baking dish is too large
this is a complete favorite of all my friends family and co workers i do not modify anything other than a few more minutes cook time and i use light sour cream for all the people saying it takes way longer or is dry how it is not supposed to 34set34 from cooking the very center should very slightly jiggle when done and if you poke it with a knife is should partially come out clean if you make this in advance do not over cook it will 34set34 as it cools
i have already made this recipe for a long time i don39t like to add as much sugar and i like to use fresh corn when i can i have made it more like a main coarse and added green chilies and cooked hamburger ham or sausage and then then added choice of cheese i have also seen people keep in the sugar and serve it as a desert with ice cream i also cook mine at 350 degrees for at least 50 minutes i like it to be a little bit brown on the top that way you know it is done all the way through
first time i made this as written and it was a bit too sweet for my taste so next time i omitted the sugar jiffy mix already contains sugar and it was 5 stars i have since made it as a texmex side with the addition of a can of green chilies topped with pepper jack cheese i also baked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes in order for it to set lynne volunteer field editor
i make corn pudding with fresh corn cut off the cob i have no use for canned crap
simply delicious i added 1tsp vanilla cinnamon and other spice mix
it has become a family favorite i always make it on a glass mold so 325 has worked fine with me
very good and simple to prepare the only change i made was not adding the cream corn and instead 2 cans of whole corn i would take the advice from others and increase the temperature to 350 at 325 the center was not done
love how easy this is to make but way too sweet at a half a cup of sugar also bake at 350 or 400 like other recipes suggest after 50 mins at 325 center still jiggles
loved this recipe baked it longer than it said though and i39m wondering if there39s a way to make it in a crock pot instead
this recipe is easier than making the whole thing from scratch which my sister does but tastes equally as delicious my family is over the top so i adjusted the recipe added an extra cup of sugar and an extra can of corn kernels yummy more like a dessert though no more ridiculous than candied yams i guess funny how we can turn perfectly healthy foods in to either candy or a heart attack happy thanksgiving
this recipe was delicious a new addition to our thanksgiving dinner and an instant favorite i did modify slightly by only adding 12 cup of sugar and i substitute a can of kernel corn for frozen corn not to sweet and a great texture
the only thing i changed was omitting the sugar and this turned out delicious i did have to bake it longer than directed wonderful dish
when i made this for thanksgiving 2 years ago everyone loved it it is a staple now
i made this recipe last night for my family we had an early thanksgiving due to me having to work i made the recipe just as directed and it turned out amazing my entire family loved it
made this for thanksgiving today and my 2 skeptical adult daughters who thought corn pudding did not sound very good both loved it made it as outlined in the directions i was impressed with how light and fluffy it turned out cooking time was under 45 minutes both of my girls stated that it reminded them of cornbread stuffing will definitely be making this again
this has been a staple at our thanksgiving table every year for at least 30 years i also like to make it as an alternative to cornbread as a side dish i include cheddar and diced fresh jalapenos for thanksgiving though it39s the classic incarnation i don39t use canned corn i use frozen as i feel it39s less mushy than canned
perfect side dish for any holiday or sunday dinner
i wouldn39t really call this a corn pudding it is a really great cornbread though i love the texture and sweetness of this
i really didn39t want to rate this because i have not tried this specific recipe i just see people saying that it takes a long time to set i make one similar i don39t use the eggs milk or sugar and it turns out great takes about an hour at 350 doubling the recipe will make it take about 30 minutes longer i use half a box of jiffy corn muffing mix with the corn sour cream and butter
made this exactly as written took way longer than 50 minutes to 34set34 i39m not impressed finally set after an hour and a half and was super dry
my family loves it
we make this often i first tasted corn pudding as a side dish at el torito restaurants but their recipe was much more involved my recipe calls for undrained corn no milk and no added sugar you can also make your own cornbread mix if you don39t like using packaged mixes
i found this recipe to be very good i found that i did need to bake the pudding longer than recipe specifiedi baked pudding 45 minute and it was not set i baked about 25 minutes longer and used a knife to test the pudding because of the lower oven temperature i felt that the pudding was slower to set delowenstein
this is very similar the recipe i39ve used for years except mine does not include the sugar it also doesn39t have the milk use undrained whole kernel corn for the liquid and it specifies to put the corn bread mix in last always a huge hit wherever i take it it39s my goto recipe when i need something that mixes up quickly 4star review because i39ve never made this recipe
absolutely fabulous made it exactly as the recipe statedand it was gone in minutes
i made the recipe as written and it was very good but i agree with other reviewers that it is too sweet next time i make it i will cut back on the sugar and may add some sauteed onions andor grated cheddar cheese
this is a great side dish i would reduce the sugar i found it sweet i would also add some cheese to the mixture next time great thanksgiving side goes great with steak too loved it
i39ve been making this for years it39s a family favorite as another reviewer wrote i also saute an onion in the butter and add to the pudding it39s a terrific side dish for barbecue in the summer we love it
i39ve been making a this for years with a twist i saute a onion in the butter than pour over top and add a sprinkle of cheese
i39ve been making this recipe ever since it was introduced in a 2006 issue it39s the one everyone asks for in fact i39m a little tired of making it for every occasion but people howl when i beg to bring something else it truly is delicious and everyone loves it what more can you ask of a recipe
made this a few weeks ago and again tonight it is very good my husband loves this recipe i have never heard of corn pudding before so i thought i would try it i39m glad i did
i made this for thanksgiving to try something new everyone loved it it was easy and so very yummy
fixed this for the first time for a church party and was asked for the recipe and my hub and said this was a keeper a similar recipe lacked the rich flavor this does definitely a pudding
made this for thanksgiving very good i added 1 tab sugar used 11 x 7 pan was perfect
i made this for thanksgiving and it came out really nice i used no sugar since i was using sweet corn and also egg whites i plan to make some more tomorrow and will be using less butter i plan to keep making this i absolutely love it
a wonderful firsttime addition to our thanksgiving meal that will now become a family tradition the whole family from youngest to oldest loved it i followed the recipe as written except i substituted about 2 cups of our homegrown frozen corn for the whole kernel corn
this was the first time i had made any version of corn pudding and it was a huge hit our group of 4 adults and 2 kids finished the pan everyone went back for seconds it was the only part of the thanksgiving meal that wasn39t leftover so the next day when we were getting ready to eat the leftovers my husband insisted i make another pan i did cook it longer the first time and preferred it compared to the recipe cook time but that was the only change
very good i make it for family dinners
yummy this will be a family favorite
delicious will definitely make it again although i might use less sugar the cornbread mix i used was very sweet
delicious the whole family loved it like a very moist cornbread with some whole kernels in it
love this made it for dinner and it39s delicious
make it for most holidays never any leftover great taste and easy to prepare
this is so delicious i made it tonight and was just perfect my kids and husband couldn39t have enough
delicious perfect texturenot too runny like some
i tried a corn casserole at a bbq and loved it searched around for a similar recipe and this one is it a little sweet with the added sugar it has a creamy corny flavor amp texture very easy to put togetheropen cansbam could make in advance amp reheat can cut into squares amp freeze good base recipe to liven up or just as it is will try a can of mexicorn green chilies cheese fresh corn and onions as others have done took 20 minutes longer since i put it in a deeper corningware i39ll just use my pyrex 9x13 next time a keeper recipe i may never make cornbread again
excellent recipe i think i used a 2 quart dish so it took longer to bake but it was a great sweettasting corn dish
everyone has their favorite substitutions i used skim milk less sugar and it is delicious i want to try it with asparagus spears on the top that might be yummy
four stars because i made so many substitutions but this is an easy recipe that adapts well to different tastes i went the savory route used only 1 t sugar added 12 c chopped onion and 1 chopped jalapeno sprinkled cheddar cheese on top the last few minutes of baking wow was it good
this is terrific i added chopped jalapeo and red peppers to the recipe it quickly disappeared very tasty
this was so easy and it was the hit of the dinner i get so tired of just corn which is the only vegetable my husband wants for holidays this was a great substitute for just corn
as written this is way too sweet so after making this several times decided to go savory with the flavors and it was just rightwe left out the sugar completely added about 12 cup diced onion a scant 14 cup minced canned jalapeos and about 12 cup sharp cheddar all the rest remained the same it did take another 10ish minutes bake time
my husband and i love this recipe i fixed it last nightbut i left out the butter sugar and substituted plain yogurt instead of the sour cream i used two boxes of jiffy mix and some no salt herbal seasoning from dollar tree turned out great and with a lot less calories and fat
excellent
this has replaced dressing at thanksgiving and christmas any leftovers my kids want to take home i only use 1 tablespoon of sugar and do add a finely chopped jalapeno 12 red pepper and 12 onion but it is good with or without
this is very good and is always a staple at our thanksgiving table everyone loves it but i do add strips of green yellow and red bell peppers for color and taste as well as diced onions my recipe was nearly identical from an insert in our electric bill but called for two cans of whole kernel and two cans of cream style plus 12 cup flour rather than the cornbread mix delicious nevertheless
to bad it39s not healthy because its absolutely the best corn casserole i39ve ever made
this was very good i made this during the holidays and there wasn39t any left it was a great alternative to just plain corn
made this as written except used whole milk came out as described in recipe family and i liked will make again i thought it was even better the next day
i added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and crumbled ritz crackers on top before baking it took nearly twice the time stated for it to set up but was the surprise hit of a holiday potluck i also had to turn the oven up to 350 after the first 45 minutes it was that runny
best corn pudding i ever had
this is great as written but i tried to cut a few calories and that works too try omitting the eggs milk and sugar or at least reduce sugar to 14 c it is still wonderful melt the butter and mix all ingredients together sometimes when it is done i sprinkle top with cheddar cheese or jack cheese if you want a little bite and put back in oven until it melts it doesn39t need a lot of cheese any which way this is good eatin39
i made the exact recipe as is and it is wonderful everyone loves iti do add a little cayenne pepper to the top while it39s baking for looks
this was a new addition to our table this thanksgiving there was not a kid or grownup all 25 people who attended who didn39t rave about this recipe i decided not to use the 12 cup sugarand it was just sweet enough without it i39ve already been asked to add this to our christmas menu
this is so wonderful everyone loves it it does tend to be sweet so feel free to cut the sugar back if you choose
my family has made this for years and it39s just not a holiday without it we make it exactly as written there may be green bean casserole leftovers but never corn casserole leftovers
i make this often without the sugar and milk but i39m looking forward to trying it with the sugar and milk i bet my grandkids will like it better with the sugarlol
i make this without sugar or milk and it is definitely sweet enough just took it to a church potluck and i was asked for the recipe
i usually make corn pudding without cornbread mix but was pleasantly suprised at how much we enjoyed this one too
there needs to be one more star for this recipe i cut the milk a little and bake it in a large glass casserole dish for best results excellent with soup stew bbq chicken and game
this is really good my sister in law makes corn pudding for family gatherings and i always enjoyed it i decided i would make this to go with my mother39s day ham this year i used house of autry cornbread mix i like to by local and their products are made in nc
delicious both my mom and i have made this many times the only change we make is to use 2 cans of whole kernel corn and leave out the creamed corn great side for a holiday or company meal
my husband doesn39t like creamed corn but he39ll eat it in this recipe great to take to a potluck
absolute perfection
this is a wonderful recipe and we will make it again in the future
i made this to take to christmas dinner with friends amp all 8 people including me loved it i cut the sugar down to 14 cup as many reviewers suggested amp it was just perfect this was a great side dish with ham amp green beans plus orangecranberry relish foolproof amp pleasing to all i39ll definitely make it again
works great even with the quarter cup of oil i had to substitute for an egg because i only had one egg left also added half teaspoon of salt and baked just a bit longer than the recommend cooking time because i like mine a bit more firm all told i think this is a pretty foolproof recipe if you like corn and cornbread you can39t go wrong with this recipe
this was the third corn pudding recipe that i have tried it was the 34charm34 it39s sweet and cakelike it39s just been voted new favorite comfort food in our household the fact that it is super easy to make is a definite working moms plus as suggested i only used 14 cup of sugar and jiffy mix and it39s perfectly sweet
i used 14 cup sugar as suggested by others this was great everyone enjoyed it i made it in a round dish with high sides and it was a bit undercooked in the middle next time i39ll use a 9x13 pan thanks for sharing
this is a great recipe i sometimes use mexican style corn in place of the whole kernel corn sometimes i put in chopped jalapeno with it left overs are great too
i have always loved this recipe does anyone know if it can be doubled or tripled and can it be made the day before and reheated for the 34big event34
if you like sweet corn pudding this is the recipe for you if you don39t like it sweet just omit the sugar and use cornbread mix that doesn39t have sugar i like to omit the sugar and add cheese jalapenos and onions
no sugar needed especially if using jiffy cornbread mix absolutely delicious i only make this at the holidays but crave it the rest of the year
this recipe is a staple at our family gatherings i sometimes add shredded cheddar cheese but ususally make it just as the recipe is written a comfort food for sure
i39ve tried numerous corn pudding recipes in the past this was simple and sweet family loved it
this recipe is great my family just loved it i had never made corn pudding before and this was my first time it came out great and i will definitely make this again and again
this recipe is wonderful i did omit the sugar as suggested delicious rather simple and i39ll definitely make this again my family men said the recipe is a 34keeper34
my niece made this for thanksgiving it was so good yes i will make it
i added sauted green pepper and onion to add and then put in a small can of diced green chiles this was a suggestion from a friend in arizona good every way
zero sugar needed i have been making this recipe for a long time i also cut butter down to 14 cup and use lowfat sour cream with no negative effects tastes great
the only adjustment i would make to this recipe is to omit the sugar completely i have always made this recipe without sugar it is not needed
this dish is a 34must34 have for every holiday meal but it is easy enough and good enough to have for tuesday night dinner my family loves it and requests it often
this is outstanding and so easy to make to kick it up a bit we added a can of diced green chiles as well we also sometimes use 14 c maple syrup instead of sugar so good
guests love this dish i always make it at the holidays
i made this recipe this week for a dinner party it is easy excellent good consistency but the next time i will use 14 c sugar instead of 12 seemed a bit too sweet i got a lot of compliments on it though and will definitely make it again and again
i make this many times we love it any time tg xmas new year or easter
this is a regular holiday and special occasion recipe at our house my daughter has already requested this and the golden potato casserole for thanksgiving
a very pleasing side dish to complete a meal because quite a few of the comments mentioned the dish being sweet i cut the sugar down to 13 cup and i would probably use only 14 in the future
pmy sisterinlaw brought this to our last family get together it was fantastic she sent us all the recipe as we all raved about it i can39t wait to make it at my next get together with friendsp
have made this for family get togethers for several yearsalways a must have request
is it a vegetable dish or is it desserteither way it is absolutely scrumptious
wonderfully rich creamed corn flavor kind of 34corn bread on steroids34
i have a recipe very simular but it doesn39t have sugar in it it has a little salt it is a hit with the family if theres any leftovers t is good frozen then warmed and yes jiffy is the best muffin mix for it
i doubled this recipe and used more creamed corn jiffy cornbread is the best cornbread to use this recipe is excellent very very tasty
what a great recipe the only thing that i did was add a pinch of salt thanks lauren
my family and friends all loved this dish i fix it often it makes any meal a special occasion some family members think this should be the dessert
very rich and sweet corn for a dessert
my motherinlaw suggested that we have a corn dish for thanksgiving i had seen this recipe and volunteered to make it it was very good a definite keeper
this is a wonderful recipe everyone loved it and we didnt have any left overs at all which i was hoping for so i could eat some later will make this again for sure
i added chopped green onions to it loved it
this is excellent it tastes very similar to the baked corn that a local restaurant sometimes serves next time i will decrease or eliminate the sugar since it was a little on the sweet side for us
pyuuuuummmyyyyyy this dish is sooooo good my family raved about it to everyone totally making this one again p
i have been making this recipie for years but i never put sugar and it is just as good
even my very fussy daughter liked this a great sidedish for when everyone39s tired of the more usual veggies and it39s a pudding in the same way a plum pudding is called a pudding a more british version of pudding than what most americans envision
absolutely never fails to be really delicious and has become a familyfriends favorite
everyone looks forward to this recipe and it goes well with a picnic or a more elegant meal
i took it to a church supper and many people asked for the recipe i tried it adding a tsp of nutmeg and a tsp of vanilla delocious thanks mary
pi really enjoyed this o it was quite sweet but that39s what i liked about it p
tasty simple sidedish
the first time i had corn pudding i thought it was going to be awful i don39t know why it39s called a pudding but it sure is delicious i love it pretty simple to make and so good
its not supposed to taste like cornbread which has less sugar
the sweetness is what makes it such a treat as a side dish it adds a surprise to the meal people request me to make this dish for parties all the time and it always goes fast
too sweet the sugar hides the sweetness of the corn
my family loves corn so i knew i had to try this recipe we all liked it but thought it was sweeter than it needed to be next time i39ll decrease the sugar by half
remove from oven top with shredded cheddar cheese or shredded swiss cheese and return to oven until cheese is melted
i made this for easter sunday and everyone loved it i will make this again very easy to prepare
i took this to work for a company christmas party and everyone went wild over it it39s so easy to make too
this is handsdown my all time favorite chili recipe and fallwinter recipe in general been making it for probability 10 years now use ground beef often when that is what i have on hand with beef or chicken stock and it always turns out great i typically use 2 lbs of ground because my family prefers meatier chilis soups and sauces
this was excellent thank you
i pondered over this recipe for a while thinking about pumpkin in soup i39m really glad i tried it because it is one of my favorite soups filling amp good for you with delicious ingredients thanks deborah amp taste of home
very easy and quite filling it39s the perfect chili for autumnwinter
i have been making this for years as a fall and winter staple we use ground turkey and double the recipe every time i make it a little bit different and it never disappoints we love to use chicken bone broth and swap out a can of corn for a can of the beans since i double it i use 4 cans of beans and used whatever is on hand but always keeping at least 1 can of black beans in this freezes well and everyone loves it
sounds great the photo looks like there are avacado chunks in the soup
this is so good i used about 6 small sweet orange peppers as that39s what i had this is going on our regular rotation jane b
this is really a very good recipes
i39ll never understand why people insist on changing things about the recipe then rating it especially giving it a bad rating you didn39t technically make the recipe so don39t rate it that being said this chilisoup is awesome just as it is i make it multiple times throughout the fall and winter i freese it in singleswvings in ziplocks and have a ready to heat and eat lunch the pumpkin gives it a richness without tasting pumpkiny just the right amount of spice
this is a fantasticly tasty recipe i used cooked ground turkey and tricolor peppers i also added a bit more cumin and chili powder served with diced red onion mexican cheese and scoops
i made this today and ate this for dinner i thought it was easy to make and it was delicious
i39ve made this over and over we all love it it doesn39t take the place of a traditional beef chili if that it what you crave but i wouldn39t expect it to wonderful recipe
i changed this recipe up a great deal first i had half a bag of frozen home style meatballs i didn39t know how i was going to use so substituted them for the turkey then i thought the spice was too strong so i added another cup of broth it still needed toning down so i added half and half to taste it really turned out quite well i will just use less cumin next time
great recipe slow cooking is great but it can be made a lot healthier instead of a crockpot i used mec pure clay pot for this recipe it cooked a lot faster and the flavor was all natural and enhanced you should try that and i promise you39d never cook in a crockpot again
this is one of our favorite chili recipes i usually substitute ground turkey ground beef or ground venison for the cubed turkey and it tastes just as good
family loves this i use tomatoes with green chilies to give it some kick
this was good i used steak instead of turkey and added chipotle powder it was a nice change from our usual chili recipe
husband says it39s a keeper i found this when looking for a different recipe for my leftover thanksgiving turkey i used leftover mashed sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin subbed white beans great northern since i didn39t have black beans on hand and my canned diced tomatoes included green chilies it was delicious
wow wow wow 34winner winner turkey dinner34
excellent recipe the ingredients are surprising but meld perfectly the pumpkin adds to the flavor and texture but is not really detectable which we liked this recipe is easy inexpensive and my family loved it i will be making this regularly i made it with leftover turkey as directed this time but will try with ground turkey at other times of the year the only modifications i made were to use a red bell pepper because that is what i had and i added a little black pepper
i leave out the meat to make it meatless excellent recipe
i39ve made this in the past and it39s always good it39s nutritious and easily edible by children
this is one of my favorite soups for fall winter sometimes i use rotisserie chicken instead or leave out the meat all together works great divided up in freezer bags and taken for lunch
one of our favorites freezes well too
so delicious had it not been for all the great reviews i might have just passed on this recipe so glad i didn39t the only changes i made were to increase the salt and add a little pepper i also used red peppers instead of yellow and chicken instead of turkey since that is what i had on hand my whole family loved this and my kids didn39t even suspect there was pumpkin in it this is so much healthier than my other chili i will definitely be making this on a regular basis and fyi this is even better the next day
i like the idea of adding pumpkin to chili and i enjoyed this recipe after i added lots more chili powder i like more heat than this recipe called for
i39ve made this recipe a couple of times for my annual super bowl party i39ve made it with the ground turkey and also made it without turkey and with vegetable broth to accommodate a vegetarian guest both times the chili was delicious the pumpkin gives it nice flavor and texture so easy to throw together and it cooks in slow cooker while i39m preparing appetizers and side dishes i39ve made rice on the side and offer cheddar cheese and sour cream for those who want such have it on hand from the other dishes i make for my party also offer tabasco for guests who want more kick it39s my favorite goto chili recipe
this was a tasty recipe and it made the whole house smell wonderful as it was cooking i took this to a work potluck and the flavors melded nicely for a couple of days before i reheated it you could really taste all the spices and the pumpkin added a depth of flavor that people couldn39t quite figure out what it was until i told them very sublime great recipe thank you
i thought i would love it but it was too soupy and spicy with no pumpkin taste if i were to make it again i would another can of pumpkin one less can of tomato and one less cup of broth i would use ground turkey and no oregano
i was really looking forward to this chili but was sadly disappointed i used ground turkey because that39s what i had on hand but the flavor just wasn39t what i was expecting at all i 34might34 try it again and leave out the oregano that just doesn39t say 34chili34 to me based on all the good reviews i really thought i would love it but didn39t
wonderful and creamy
wonderful i used chicken instead of turkey and fresh parsley instead of dried
loved this i used ground pork because i had it you can probably use any ground or shredded meat i added a 12 cup of salsa and a little more chili powder i will add another can of pumpkin next time and a couple jalapenos toss a little grated cheese on topdefinitely a keeper
yum we enjoyed this very much i used 99 lean ground turkey breast instead of the cubed cooked turkey but made no other changes don39t worry if you like my husband aren39t a big fan of pumpkin you really can39t taste it at all it just adds fiber and nutrients and helps to thicken the chili bonus for weight watchers followers a generous serving is very low in points and very filling try it
this is a simple and good tasting chili
really good tastes like a southwestern chili will make again
i made as directed it was wonderful very easy as there wasn39t much chopping to do a very hearty chili amp the avocado amp green onion topper was perfect thanks for yet another very good recipe from taste of home
very good and healthy i make this often and it freezes well i have also used browned ground turkey and it is a good substitution
delicious quick and easy i didn39t make any changes to the recipe my husband and i loved this it was perfect for lunch on a chilly day
we loved it
i made this and my family devoured it only substitutions because of what i had on hand were chicken tenders for turkey fire roasted diced tomatoes gave a little extra kick and home made veggie broth that i had frozen previously in place of the chicken broth this is a great tasting soupstew and i will be making it again
this was a big hit in our house i left the pumpkin part a secret and just told them it was a black bean chili i used chicken tenderloins that i cooked with the onion yellow pepper and garlic i also doubled the salt and added 12 t of ground black pepper i will definitely be making this again
excellent twist on chili used pumpkin puree it39s what i had at hand and added a chunked sweet potato for texture and bulk recipe is quite 39mild39 as is i added a tsp of chipotle powder and a bit of crushed pepper in addition to the chili and it still barely tingled good fiber and fairly low net carbs very easy will make again
wonderful with leftover turkey
soup is delicious and what a nice change from your typical chili even my picky husband loved it after he had a bowl i told him pumpkin was in it and he gave me the 34getoutofhere don39ttellmethat3934 look i just laughed and i don39t know if he realizes pumpkin is really in it or not but eating 2 bowls means he thoroughly enjoyed it it is a very easy recipe the only changes i made was i baked chicken tenders because that it is what i had in the house to add to the chili and simmered soup on the stove for 45 minutes instead of in the slow cooker either way delicious for those that gave it 1 2 or even 3 stars they had to have made a mistakes in making it and if it was too bland spice it up
my entire family loved this recipe an easy recipe to make that tastes great i was short on time so i skipped the slow cooker and cooked it on the stove top for 45 minutes couldn39t find chunked pumpkin so i used 8 oz of frozen sweet potatoes and 8 oz of frozen butternut squash i will be making this recipe often
a very easy recipe to follow and one i make with very few changes no yellow pepper but the canned tomatoes are fire roasted and use 1 lb browned ground turkey more 39chili like39 a definite keeper and one for those cold rainysnowy nights served with fritoes on top
i39ve made this 3 or 4 times now most recently for a halloween themed potluck at work because we were supposed to come up with a spooky theme i labeled it pumpkin chile with black beetles the beetles of course were the black beans i didn39t have any turkey so i sprinkled some southwestern style seasoning on a package of chicken thighs after removing the skin and baked them when the thighs cooled off i chopped them up and added them to the chili i usually cook this on the stove top since i 39m not patient enough to wait for the slow cooker i made a double batch and poured as much as i could fit into the slow cooker the next morning several coworkers took some of the leftovers home for dinner it did come out a little soupy add broth gradually but it tasted great
i made this without the meat i didn39t have any used vegetable broth not because i39m vegetarian but because it39s what i had on hand and i oven roasted about a pound of pumpkin chunks from a small pumpkin and pureed it i also used a can of rotel instead of diced tomatoes roasting the pumpkin made it really yummy
delicious and the pumpkin gave it a different flavor
my daughter does not like chili period except this one she can39t digest chilipowder foods very well but we have found that when i substitute pumpkin pie spice for most not all of the chili powder and add some brown sugar and a bit of cinnamon i have to make a double batch or we won39t have any leftovers also when i use ground turkey we like the texture more great dish
i39m allergic to bell pepper so i substituted thinly sliced carrots for texture and it worked really well also i used ground turkey to come closer to a traditional chili it tasted great next time i might double the batch size and freeze some for later
i made this on the stove top since i was getting dinner started late used diced cooked chicken instead of the turkey because i always have it on hand in the freezer used a full quart of chicken broth 4 cups instead of the 3 cups called for because i like more volume and for the diced tomatoes i used del monte diced tomatoes and zesty jalapenos because my husband and i like spicy it turned out great definitely a keeper
great recipe added a few jalepenoes for heat
love this and it39s so easy a versatile recipe ingredients are easily swapped out
this was a very flavorful chili i used ground turkey and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies it could easily be adapted to ground beef as well if that is your preference i would definitely make this chili again
love love love we always have a big gathering in the fall with friends and family this is always the favorite
yum
this a great one to make for the fall season tasted great i used ground turkey in place of cubed turkey i loved this bc i could also feed this to my son who is now eating solids i just mashed the beans flat with a fork so they were not a choking hazard and broke the ground turkey in small pieces while cooking it
this is one great recipe we love in the fall and winter since it gives a great vegatable serving we spice it up a bit by adding some cayenne andor jalepeno peppers
i love a good traditional beef kidney bean and tomato sauce chili but i think this is one of the best chili recipes i have ever had the flavor is fantastic though a little mild but it is easy to spice up a little more if desired i made it with shredded leftover turkey from thanksgiving
use rotel tomatoes instead of reg to add more spice
made this with leftover christmas turkey you can39t taste the pumpkin just a yummy chili hits the spot on cold winter days
loved this chili it39s delicious but does not taste like pumpkin at all i used ground turkey instead of cubed and it was delicious
this was super easy and inexpensive and my fiance loved iti took a few suggestions from other reviewsturkey kielbasa instead of chicken1 can rotel instead of diced tomatoes3t chili powder2 cups chicken broth still a little too soupy for my taste would likely do 15 next timedash of cayenne pepperdash of red pepper flakes12tsp cinnamon
i make this with ground beef instead of turkey and it is hearty and comforting
my entire family loved this here are the changes i made used a red pepper skipped saute step and put it all in the slow cooker added another can of black beans used 2 large cans of chicken instead of turkey added 12 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder used 2 teaspoons of salt also i had made some corn stock from left over cobs that i had frozen the corn off eugina bone39s recipe and used that instead of chicken broth
one of the best chili recipes i make this every year in the fall and winter everyone i make it for always ask for the recipe
this is more than excellent and i wish i could give it more stars
fantastic would rate a six if i could so unique to have a chili that doesn39t have a 39red sauce39 flavor will be a regular
this is a monthly meal for our family i use half black bean half northern i add 2 tsp cinnamon and 3 tbsp brown sugar since peppers are hcrazy expensive when we want to eat it i freeze chopped fresh peppers in the summer
what a wonderful surprise very easy to make and tastes fabulous a nice addition to my glutenfree menu
wow this recipe makes the best just allaround classictasting chili if you39re craving a good simpletasting chili this is it the pumpkin gives the chili a nice thickness but doesn39t impart any flavor its just good
i make this dish regularly in the cold weather months love it
love this recipe i39ve made it several times and it always turns out deliciousonly thing i changed was double the spicesadded a tblsp of hot sauce and i also used ckn because thats what i had in the fridgequick and easy recipe
good fall soup
based on previous reviews that it was too soupy cut the chicken broth to 2 cups also substituted 1 10 oz can rotel original plus 12 of 8 oz can tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes used rotisserie chicken instead of turkey and replaced the yellow pepper with celery garnished with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips didn39t really taste the pumpkin as much as it just gave it a wonderful earthy taste the whole family loved it
this was very very yummy but i did need to add a lot more spice to it i used about 3 tbs of chilly powder and 1 tbs of cayenne pepper and i don39t like things to be spice but this made it just spice enough yum yum
i made this but after reading some of the reviews that thought it was a little bland i decided to use chunky salsa in place of the diced tomatoes and i used turkey sausage instead of the cooked diced turkey it was deliciousi will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe with my friends
unique and very tasty
i made it for about 20 souls they all loved it
delicious yes i did tweak the spices cut back to 1 cup chicken broth to make it chunkier amp left out the turkey to make it very lowcal but it was good just add more spice tastes like a spicy butternutsquash soupi even thought i might use my immersion blender amp process it very smooth lots of ideas with this basic soup
very easy and healthy i agree with previous reviews that it needed extra spices i added a lot more chili powder and some cayenne pepper then it was delish
i love this recipe but it definitely needs more spices i added more chili powder garlic powder and salt this will definitely become a fall staple
happened across this recipe linked from a blog i was following and decided to whip it up i made some minor adjustments for tasted but mostly followed the recipe everyone who ate it gave it great reviewthe blog that linked it suggested using kielbasa sausage instead of turkey cuts seemed odd and it worked out great i also cut the broth to 2 cups because i wanted it less soupy and it worked well for that also added 12 tsp of cinnamon and 12 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes for some added heat spot on perfectnext time i might try using a ground turkey sausage for meat and maybe add some corn to the mixquick and easy recipe to enjoy have at it
i really like the idea of the pumpkin and it does thicken the chili nicely but i also found the chili to be a little bland it really needs a little more salt chili powder and a bit of sweetness to bring out the flavors and enhance the pumpkin so i added 2 t of frank39s hot sauce a bit more chili powder 1 t of packed dark brown sugar and 2 splenda packets to sweeten a bit more but not wreck the nutritional value of the recipe chili and the intensity of flavors is a personal preference i39ve modified the recipe to our family39s preferences i will make this again thanks for the great idea
this was so good the pumpkin was perfect as a thickening agent i39m putting this on my halloween dinner party menu
my kids and i love this
came out really soupy next time would add chicken broth by only a fraction
i have made this multiple times the first few times i made it i only used 2 cans of chicken broth and substituted tomato puree or paste for the canned tomatoes this recipe is a little tricky just because if you don39t have a good balance of spice the pumpkin can be a little funky if you39re not a huge pumpkin fan my family really likes it and overall they are generally picky eaters
it just tasted funny to me
the pumpkin adds a creamy delicious texture i made this one vegan by omitting the meat and using veggie broth
i really changed some things in this recipe but plan on trying the original when i have all the ingredients i used extra beans and cubed chicken did not have turkey didn39t have yellow pepper so used frozen summer squash diced also out of tomato39s so used salsa which made it so thick so used extra broth not done yet buy did taste test and its wonderful and soooo full of flavor the five stars if because i already know the original recipe is great without trying it yet i also sauted the chicken pieces in the olive oil then the onionsand garlic along with the bits of goodies left in the pan wonderfulthank you for the great recipe
delicious and easy i used ground turkey and half the black beans and served it over spaghetti noodles yum
this was great substituted out the tomatoes and replaced with more pepper also added more pumpkin it was great everyone loved it
works out well if cooked on stove top as well i have made this with ground turkey when i didn39t have any leftover turkey to use because the family loves it it turns out tasty either way
this black bean and pumpkin chili recipe is terrific very fast and simple preparation however i did add 1tbsp tomato paste 1 can of pinto beans cooked and crumbled bacon i also used basil instead of parsley and oregano only because i ran out defiantly adding this recipe to my recipe book
loved this recipe we actually used chopped chorizo instead of turkey yum yum even my little kids liked it
neither my husband or i are pumpkin fans but this was excellent will make again for company
made this twice in two weeks once to try and again to serve for company i did add half a can of tomato paste to thicken up but i like my chili thick very tasty
i made this last night with a precooked turkey breast from the supermarket deli i made it on top of the stove instead of in the crock pot and let it simmer for about and hour to blend the flavors i had about 34 of a can of pumpkin left over from a coffee cake i had made last weekend and it worked out fine i used lower sodium chicken broth and black beans and it was still salty enough for us i also substituted a can of mild diced tomatoes with chiles for the regular diced tomatoes i noticed one reader said that the recipe turned out too soupy try taking the lid off and cooking it on high a little longer in the crick pot or simmering it with the lid off for a few minutes on top of the stove my husband and son both rated this a 5 the best part is that they never guessed it had canned pumpkin in it
this is so delicious i made it for my recipe club and everyone loved it i have made it several times since it is fantastic flavor easy to make and soooo good for you
i made this on the stove and my friends and family loved it i made it 3 times in one week loved it
when i make chili i brown the meat then add all the spices and let simmer for 20 minit seems like then u can taste the spices betteri used ground turkey and one can of red gold petite diced tomatoes with chilies hot lots more flavor used one can black bleans and one can dark red kidney beans did not add the yellow pepper hubby does not like peppers in his chili thanks for sharing
my husband and i loved this chili recipe it was hearty and healthy too i used ground turkey in place of the cooked turkey and it was great definitely a keeper
i didn39t use the chicken broth i used a large can of crushed tomatoes a spicy can of diced tomatoes along with extra spices sugar the taste is a bit bland wo the extra ingredients oh and lots of hot sauce
doubled the recipe and added a rotisserie chicken to it and it was wonderful
i feel bad writing this because everyone else liked it so much but for my family it had no kick at all chili is suppose to have some kick right if you like your chili runny and bland then i guess this would be good
loved it pumpkin gave me less of a problem with stomach acid afterward that i typically have with chili no tums for me
forgot to mention that i use chicken instead of turkey
this is my all time favorite recipe as soon as the fall temps arrive it is the first thing i make i am on weight watchers and this recipe fits right into my plan full of healthy hearty and yummy ingredients
made this recipe this past weekend and absolutely loved it family was a little unsure about the pumpkin in it until they tried itmy boys couldn39t get enough
i add 1 lb of ground cooked turkey so i can make it more often my family one who is very picky love this soup it is very filling and i serve with corn muffins it39s always a hit
so yummy will make many more times before the weather warms
i made this for my family it fit into the weight watcher plan and they all loved it and could not guess the secret ingredient
i used ground turkey added a 4 oz can of green chilies and another teaspoon of chili powder took it to a chili cookoff and it came in 2nd place many compliments on it
this was absolutely delicious i can39t wait to make it again can39t say enough about it it was greati mostly like 34regular34 chili recipes this was a little different will be my new favorite you have to make this deserves more than 5 stars
yum for our tastes i omitted the yellow pepper and grilled a couple chicken breasts on the indoor grill to replace the turkey used part of a packet of chili seasoning instead of the spices called for and added a can od whole kernel corn for a bit more sweetness served it with shredded cheddar tortilla chips and sour cream hubby loved it even after i confessed about the pumpkin
i took it to a potluck untested everyone loved it its a keeper
i took it to a potluck untested everyone loved it its a keeper
excellent i doubled the recipe as i had 29oz can of pumpkin there was enough room in the large crockpot
for a little extra kick i added a chopped jalapeno it is so good my husband requested that i make it for him to take deer hunting to share with the gang
not impressed at all but much better than the last bean soup i made

i was a little apprehensive about this one but boy was it tasty i think this will be one of my favorites this fall absolutely delicious
i think i would try chicken next time i would have liked a bit stronger pumpkin flavor as well i tossed in a dash of cinammon which added a nice flavor
i used a roasted chicken it was very good
this chili is wonderful amp low cal

i love this and have been eating it all week i am taking it to a chili cook off tomorrow night the only thing i would change is to decrease the chicken broth 12 to 1 cup the consistency with 3 cups made the chili more soupy i prefer my chili thicker
i love this recipe and have made it several times already it isn39t very spicybut i prefer it that way so that my guests can spice it to their liking
this is my new favorite chili recipe
this chili was phenominal it was so easy to make and was so flavorful the only addition i did was to add a minced jalapeno pepper my family loved it i will definitely make it again
pi made this for a get together and people declared it the best chili they had ever eaten i thought it was good but slightly bland and needs a little 34something34 elsep
peveryone in my family that tried it thought it was great for my taste i thought it was a bit bland and added hot sauce to it for myselfp

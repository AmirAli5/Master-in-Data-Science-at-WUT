#### In this repository, I document my journey through the Master of Data Science program at Warsaw University of Technology, which was fully funded by the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) and successfully completed from October 2021 to October 2023. This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my academic and personal growth during this period. https://sites.google.com/view/amir-ali
#### The Master's in Data Science Program run by the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science is among the first European programs in Data Science and is fully focused on data engineering and data analytics.
